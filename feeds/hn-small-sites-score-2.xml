<p>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</p>
<p>&gt; To enhance our natural thin-slicing abilities, humans have
therefore also developed various cultural practices that make these
instant assessments more reliable. These techniques take advantage
of the fact that deception is fundamentally a cold-cognition act
and relies on cognitive control centers. This means that if we can
impair the cognitive control abilities of people we're trying to
judge, we’ll do a better job of sussing them out: they will
be less able to confuse our cheater-detection systems.</p>
<p>&gt; In one study that has proven enormously useful to law
enforcement agencies, researchers found that police officers could
significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if
suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting
with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not
the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it
increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are
less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this
way.</p>
<p>&gt; This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law
enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential
business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to
make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to
achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce
subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the
load-adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the
load constant but decrease cognitive control ability-weaken the
mental muscles-by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to
do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves
applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the
skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly
widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad
form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets.</p>
<p>&gt; A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce
the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we
discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and
other intoxicants is to "downregulate," or temporarily paralyze,
areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. A
couple shots of tequila is the liquid equivalent of a nice jolt of
TMS. It’s therefore no accident that intoxicants of various
sorts are frequently employed by human beings as social lubricants.
Alcohol, kava, cannabis, magic mushrooms, you name it: any
intoxicant that people can get their hands on quickly comes to play
a central role in social occasions, both formal and informal. In
ancient China, no major treaty was signed without first bringing
everyone together in an extended, alcohol-soaked banquet. In fact,
this is one feature of Chinese culture that has not changed a bit
in over four thousand years. Any modern businessperson hoping to
ink a deal with Chinese partners had better get his or her liver in
shape first.</p>
<p>&gt; On a less formal level, this is no doubt why intoxicants
are a universal feature of all sorts of human social gatherings,
from casual cocktail parties to fraternity mixers. Not only is
getting drunk pleasant, it also typically causes people to get
along more freely and easily (at least to a certain point, after
which the drunken fights break out). Intoxication enhances
cooperation in at least two ways. First of all, it reduces social
faking by inhibiting cognitive control centers. Second, if we all
get drunk together, we create a situation of mutual vulnerability
that makes trust easier to establish. Getting drunk is essentially
an act of mental disarmament. In the same way that shaking right
hands with someone assures them that you’re not holding a
weapon, downing a few tequila shots is like checking your
prefrontal cortex at the door. See? No cognitive control. You can
trust me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Migrating a server to the cloud</em> always sounds great. But we know it’s a hassle. Especially for servers in production. We want a new server, but keeping current data. And we need to migrate it fast with minimum service disruption.</p>
<p>It takes some time to understand how to do it. Therefore I wrote a <strong>step-by-step guide</strong> to make migration simple and repeatable. Here is how I did it.</p>
<p>

  </p>
<h2>1. Creating a CloudEndure Account</h2>
<p>The tool I used is CloudEndure. This is a free tool that orchestrates migration tasks. To get started, I created a <a href="https://console.cloudendure.com/#/register/register">CloudEndure account</a>. I received a confirmation email. And afterward, I was able to log in to CloudEndure console.</p>
<h2>2. Granting Access to AWS Account</h2>
<p>The first step in the console was creating a new project.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Note that the CloudEndure account is different from the AWS account. So I needed to create a user that gives CloudEndure access to my AWS account. I followed the steps described in <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/#Generating_and_Using_Your_Credentials/Working_with_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials/Generating_the_Required_AWS_Credentials.htm">Generating the Required AWS Credentials</a>. The result was an access key ID and a secret access key.</p>
<p>Then I added these credentials in CloudEndure console and click Save. This verified that CloudEndure got access to my AWS account. And the project changed from <em>“Project not setup”</em> to <em>“Project not fully setup”</em> status.</p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>3. Defining Replication Settings</h2>
<p>Once communication with AWS is enabled, the next step was configuring the migration project details. I set the migration source to <em>“Other Infrastructure”</em> (because the server to migrate was located on-premises). And I set the target to <em>“AWS US East (Northern Virginia)”</em>. That was the region chosen to migrate the server.</p>
<p>That project tab also had these settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication instance type</li>
<li>Converter instance type</li>
<li>Disks types (SSD or standard)</li>
<li>Subnet (where Replication Servers will be launched)</li>
<li>Security Groups (for Replication servers)</li>
<li>Network Bandwith Throttling</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the <strong>replication instances</strong> are used to continuously sync your source disks to the cloud. CloudEndure completely manages them.</p>
<p>Apart from these, CloudEndure uses temporary <strong>converter instances</strong>. They adapt the source disks just before launching the target machine, so they can boot and run in the cloud. This might include changing the bootloader and adding drivers for the new HW.</p>
<p>In my case, I just used default settings, and click <em>“Save replication Settings”</em>. And I got a <em>“Project setup complete”</em> message.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure project setup complete" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/5c4d3d5e1f6676482cb11fc622f6a34e/a6d36/CloudEndure03.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/5c4d3d5e1f6676482cb11fc622f6a34e/772e8/CloudEndure03.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>4. Verifying Agent Requirements</h2>
<p>The <em>“Cloudendure agent”</em> is a small program to install on the source machine. It connects to CloudEndure and sends the disks data to <em>“replication servers”</em> on the AWS account. The replication is continuous. So any change in the source is automatically sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>First I checked CloudEndure <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Getting_Started_with_CloudEndure/Supported_Operating_Systems/Supported_Operating_Systems.htm">supported operating systems</a>. Ubuntu is supported from version 12.04. So my OS was supported.</p>
<p>I also checked the other agent <a href="https://docs.cloudendure.com/Content/Installing_the_CloudEndure_Agents/Agent_Installation_Requirements/Agent_Installation_Requirements.htm">installation prerequisites</a>. All these verifications makes sure that the agent works correctly in the source machine.</p>
<h2>5. Installing the Agent</h2>
<p>Then I installed the CloudEndure agent on the source server. The <em>“Machine”</em> window on CloudEndure console showed how to install the agent.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure agent installation instructions" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/5a190/CloudEndure04.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/772e8/CloudEndure04.png 200w,
https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/e17e5/CloudEndure04.png 400w,
https://www.iobasis.com/static/e6fccda739f4a9d99b3816d12447d156/5a190/CloudEndure04.png 800w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>For Linux source machines, there are 2 commands. The first one downloads the agent. And the second one installs it. This command also has a code (the <em>“Agent Installation Code”</em>) that links the agent to a particular CloudEndure account.</p>
<p>The installation wasn’t as simple as it appeared. I had to use <code>python3</code> command (instead of <code>python</code>). The first installation also failed. The agent didn’t detect the root disk correctly. But I removed the <code>--no-prompt</code> argument from the second installation command. That allowed me to specify the correct device <code>/dev/sda</code> during the installation process.</p>
<p>The second installation had issues also. CloudEndure agent couldn’t establish a connection to the console. In order to solve this, I installed some packages (<code>make</code>, <code>openssl</code>, <code>wget</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>gcc</code>, and <code>build-essential</code>). This solved the problem and the agent was finally installed. Both product documentation and <code>~/cloudendure.log</code> were useful for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure agent installed" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cce179e8a0a83e3acead559400a4259/76cea/CloudEndure05.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cce179e8a0a83e3acead559400a4259/772e8/CloudEndure05.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<h2>6. Replicating Disk</h2>
<p>After installing the agent, a row appeared in the <em>“Machines”</em> tab of CloudEndure console, and it showed the source server’s name (<em>“ubuntu”</em>).</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure new source machine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cbea1d7ca1d3b0b154b537e2a1d6be2/5a190/CloudEndure06.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/6cbea1d7ca1d3b0b154b537e2a1d6be2/772e8/CloudEndure06.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>That row also showed the status of the replication. For example, at the moment of the screenshot, replication was 3.78% complete. And the ETA to get full replication was <em>“An hour”</em>. This indicator is very useful when you need to sync lots of data (or your upload bandwidth is limited).</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure launched a <strong>t3.small</strong> machine on the target region.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure replication server" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/843277e88d0bc650ef2fc1b7981ec69e/5a190/CloudEndure07.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/843277e88d0bc650ef2fc1b7981ec69e/772e8/CloudEndure07.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>That instance was used as the <strong>Replication instance</strong>. It runs when there is any replication in progress. And it replicates up to 15 source volumes simultaneously.</p>
<p>I also noticed that CloudEndure created 2 EBS volumes:</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure EBS Volumes" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/227ba/CloudEndure08.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/7dcd217a12ee248e880a4175081dcf8a/772e8/CloudEndure08.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Both volumes were attached to the replication server. The first one was intended to store the replicated data. And the volume size was the same as the source disk (in this case 8 GiB). And the second volume was for the <strong>replication server</strong> software.</p>
<p>I also found that CloudEndure created snapshots of these volumes. I found multiple snapshots of my disc, as shown below.</p>
<p>

<h2>7. Completing Replication</h2>
<p>After some time, the sync finished. It took me around 2 hours to sync an 8 Gb disk. Here is a screenshot of the console at that moment:</p>

<p>Note that the Data Replication Progress changed to <em>“Continuous Data Replication”</em>. That means there was an EBS volume with a complete replica of my source volume. And that any changes were replicated instantly to AWS.</p>
<p>By clicking in the target machine row, I was able to see the details of the machine in CloudEndure. And the main characteristics of the source server were also described there (e.g. CPUs, Memory, OS, Disks, and installed packages).</p>

<p>The Blueprint tab described the Target configuration. These are the settings of the target server to launch in AWS.</p>

  </p>
<p>CloudEndure automatically defines the settings of the target machine (for example machine type, subnets, IP, Security Group, and Disk Type). These settings are very important because they define the new EC2 instance characteristics. It’s important to review these settings and adjust default values if necessary.</p>
<p>In my case, I just adjusted a few parameters. First, I changed the machine type to t3.medium. I also set the <em>“Private IP”</em> to <em>“Create new”</em>. This assigns the target machine an IP in the target subnet. And also changed the disk type to SDD. That was all I needed to fine-tune my new server.</p>
<h2>8. Testing the Launch</h2>
<p>The next step was making sure that the server migration would be successful. So I made a test launch before final migration. This is started with the <em>“Launch Target Machines”</em> button.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>This process creates the new EC2 instance with the migrated volume. That was completed in 7 minutes. And I found the new EC2 instance in the AWS Console. That was very fast.</p>
<p>

  </p>
<p>I noticed that there was an instance in <em>“Terminated”</em> state. That’s normal. That’s the temporary converter instance. The conversion time was below 2 minutes. And that conversion instance was terminated afterward.</p>
<p>I wrote down the public IP address of the new instance just launched in the Virginia region. And I was able to login to the instance without any issue. That means that the migration test was successful.</p>

  </p>
<h2>9. Removing Unused Test Resources</h2>
<p>After all tests on the instance were completed, I still had the target instance running on AWS. And it wasn’t useful anymore. So I decided to remove its resources from AWS. This was done by selecting the instance in CloudEndure console and choosing <em>“Delete Target Machine”</em>.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="CloudEndure Delete Target Machine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/07484/CloudEndure16.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/ebff82e8acaa67b072fc56c3a3eb7bd8/772e8/CloudEndure16.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>Then, the target instance was terminated in AWS as expected.</p>
<p>Note that the replication instance was still active. It was still used to sync the source machine.</p>
<p>

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>But I noticed that the Volume previously used by the Target instance wasn’t removed from AWS. So deleted it on my own.</p>
<h2>10. Cutover</h2>
<p>Then the last step was the final migration. I launched a new machine. But this time I used <em>“Cutover Mode”</em> instead of <em>“Test Mode”</em>.</p>
<p>The process was the same as in the <em>“Test Mode”</em>. A new machine was launched in 7 minutes. And I was able to log into the migrated server successfully. So the migration completed successfully again.</p>
<h2>11. Cleaning up</h2>
<p>I still had lots of unused resources on my AWS account. These are the steps I took to clean everything up:</p>
<ul>
<li>I completed a <em>“Remove Machine from this console”</em> on CloudEndure Console. This removes the agent from the source server and stops replication. Note that the target machine isn’t modified. We don’t want the migrated server to be terminated.</li>
<li>I terminated the <em>“Replication Server”</em> instance in AWS (because I had no other replication in progress). This has to be done manually because it isn’t done by CloudEndure.</li>
<li>I removed the EBS volumes previously used by <em>“Replication Server”</em>.</li>
<li>I also removed all unused snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This process allowed me to <strong>lift-and-shift</strong> the server. Lift-and-shift is always the first step in the cloud journey. And this tool allowed to complete it efficiently.</p>
<p>I want to mention that the process had many advantages. For example, I used the same tool for uploading the data to the cloud and orchestrate the migration. I was also able to test the process before the cutover. That’s very important because it eliminates possible migration mistakes. The unavailability period was very short. Additionally, I didn’t have to adapt the disk to boot in the cloud, because that was managed by the tool. And this process allows me to automate the migration of …</p></div></div>

<article>
  <p>There has been a sudden resurgence of interest in my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html">“donut” code from 2006</a>, and I’ve
had a couple requests to explain this one.  It’s been five years now, so it’s
not exactly fresh in my memory, so I will reconstruct it from scratch, in great
detail, and hopefully get approximately the same result.</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>
<pre>             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=
 ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[N&gt;0?N:0];}}/*#****!!-*/
  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~
       ~::==!!!**********!!!==::-
         .,~~;;;========;;;:~-.
             ..,--------,*/
</pre>
<p>…and the output, animated in Javascript:
</p>
<pre id="d"></pre>

<p>At its core, it’s a framebuffer and a Z-buffer into which I render pixels.
Since it’s just rendering relatively low-resolution ASCII art, I massively
cheat.  All it does is plot pixels along the surface of the torus at
fixed-angle increments, and does it densely enough that the final result looks
solid.  The “pixels” it plots are ASCII characters corresponding to the
illumination value of the surface at each point: <code>.,-~:;=!*#$@</code> from dimmest to
brightest.  No raytracing required.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?  Well, let’s start with the basic math behind 3D
perspective rendering.  The following diagram is a side view of a person
sitting in front of a screen, viewing a 3D object behind it.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/perspective.png"></center>

<p>To render a 3D object onto a 2D screen, we project each point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) in
3D-space onto a plane located <em>z’</em> units away from the viewer, so that the
corresponding 2D position is (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>).  Since we’re looking from the side,
we can only see the <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> axes, but the math works the same for the <em>x</em>
axis (just pretend this is a top view instead).  This projection is really easy
to obtain: notice that the origin, the <em>y</em>-axis, and point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) form a
right triangle, and a similar right triangle is formed with (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>,<em>z’</em>).
Thus the relative proportions are maintained:</p>



<p>So to project a 3D coordinate to 2D, we scale a coordinate by the screen
distance <em>z’</em>.  Since <em>z’</em> is a fixed constant, and not functionally a
coordinate, let’s rename it to <em>K<sub>1</sub></em>, so our projection equation
becomes .  We can choose
<em>K<sub>1</sub></em> arbitrarily based on the field of view we want to show in our
2D window.  For example, if we have a 100x100 window of pixels, then the view
is centered at (50,50); and if we want to see an object which is 10 units wide
in our 3D space, set back 5 units from the viewer, then <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> should
be chosen so that the projection of the point <em>x</em>=10, <em>z</em>=5 is still on the
screen with <em>x’</em> &lt; 50: 10<em>K<sub>1</sub></em>/5 &lt; 50, or <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> &lt; 25.</p>

<p>When we’re plotting a bunch of points, we might end up plotting different
points at the same (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>) location but at different depths, so we maintain
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> which stores
the <em>z</em> coordinate of everything we draw.  If we need to plot a location, we
first check to see whether we’re plotting in front of what’s there already.  It
also helps to compute <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup>  and use that when depth
buffering because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> = 0 corresponds to infinite depth, so we can pre-initialize
our z-buffer to 0 and have the background be infinitely far away</li>
  <li>we can re-use <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> when computing <em>x’</em> and <em>y’</em>:
Dividing once and multiplying by <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> twice is cheaper than
dividing by <em>z</em> twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, how do we draw a donut, AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>?  Well, a torus is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of
revolution</a>, so one way to do it is to draw a 2D circle around some point in
3D space, and then rotate it around the central axis of the torus.  Here is a
cross-section through the center of a torus:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/torusxsec.png"></center>

<p>So we have a circle of radius <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> centered at point
(<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,0,0), drawn on the <em>xy</em>-plane.  We can draw this by sweeping
an angle — let’s call it <em>θ</em> — from 0 to 2π:</p>

<p>\[
(x,y,z) = (R_2,0,0) + (R_1 \cos \theta, R_1 \sin \theta, 0)
\]</p>

<p>Now we take that circle and rotate it around the <em>y</em>-axis by another angle
— let’s call it φ.  To rotate an arbitrary 3D point around one of the
cardinal axes, the standard technique is to multiply by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a>.  So if
we take the previous points and rotate about the <em>y</em>-axis we get:</p>





<p>But wait: we also want the whole donut to spin around on at least two more axes
for the animation.  They were called <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in the original code: it was a
rotation about the <em>x</em>-axis by <em>A</em> and a rotation about the <em>z</em>-axis by <em>B</em>.
This is a bit hairier, so I’m not even going write the result yet, but it’s a
bunch of matrix multiplies.</p>



<p>Churning through the above gets us an (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) point on the surface of our
torus, rotated around two axes, centered at the origin.  To actually get screen
coordinates, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the torus somewhere in front of the viewer (the viewer is at the
origin) — so we just add some constant to <em>z</em> to move it backward.</li>
  <li>Project from 3D onto our 2D screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have another constant to pick, call it <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, for the distance
of the donut from the viewer, and our projection now looks like:</p>

<p>\[
\left( x’, y’ \right)
=
\left( \frac{K_1 x}{K_2 + z} , \frac{K_1 y}{K_2 + z} \right)
\]</p>

<p><em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> can be tweaked together to change the field
of view and flatten or exaggerate the depth of the object.</p>

<p>Now, we could implement a 3x3 matrix multiplication routine in our code and
implement the above in a straightforward way.  But if our goal is to shrink the
code as much as possible, then every 0 in the matrices above is an opportunity
for simplification.  So let’s multiply it out.  Churning through a bunch of
algebra (thanks Mathematica!), the full result is:</p>



<p>Well, that looks pretty hideous, but we we can precompute some common
subexpressions (e.g. all the sines and cosines, and )
and reuse them in the code.  In fact I came up with a completely different
factoring in the original code but that’s left as an exercise for the reader.
(The original code also swaps the sines and cosines of A, effectively rotating
by 90 degrees, so I guess my initial derivation was a bit different but that’s
OK.)</p>

<p>Now we know where to put the pixel, but we still haven’t even considered which
shade to plot.  To calculate illumination, we need to know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal">surface normal</a> —
the direction perpendicular to the surface at each point.  If we have that,
then we can take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
product</a> of the surface normal with the light direction, which we can choose
arbitrarily.  That gives us the cosine of the angle between the light direction
and the surface direction: If the dot product is &gt;0, the surface is facing
the light and if it’s &lt;0, it faces away from the light.  The higher the
value, the more light falls on the surface.</p>

<p>The derivation of the surface normal direction turns out to be pretty much the
same as our derivation of the point in space.  We start with a point on a
circle, rotate it around the torus’s central axis, and then make two more
rotations.  The surface normal of the point on the circle is fairly obvious:
it’s the same as the point on a unit (radius=1) circle centered at the origin.</p>

<p>So our surface normal (<em>N<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>y</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>z</sub></em>) is
derived the same as above, except the point we start with is just (cos
<em>θ</em>, sin <em>θ</em>, 0).  Then we apply the same rotations:</p>



<p>So which lighting direction should we choose?  How about we light up surfaces
facing behind and above the viewer: .  Technically
this should be a normalized unit vector, and this vector has a magnitude of
√2.  That’s okay – we will compensate later.  Therefore we compute the
above (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>), throw away the <em>x</em> and get our luminance <em>L</em> = <em>y</em>-<em>z</em>.</p>



<p>Again, not too pretty, but not terrible once we’ve precomputed all the sines
and cosines.</p>

<p>So now all that’s left to do is to pick some values for <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>.  In the original donut
code I chose <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>=1 and <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>=2, so it has the same
geometry as my cross-section diagram above.  <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> controls the
scale, which depends on our pixel resolution and is in fact different for <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> in the ASCII animation.  <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, the distance from the viewer
to the donut, was chosen to be 5.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the above equations and written a quick and dirty canvas
implementation here, just plotting the pixels and the lighting values from the
equations above.  The result is not exactly the same as the original as some of
my rotations are in opposite directions or off by 90 degrees, but it is
qualitatively doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Here it is: </p>

<canvas id="canvasdonut" width="300" height="240">
</canvas>

<p>It’s slightly mind-bending because you can see right through the torus, but the
math does work!  Convert that to an ASCII rendering with <em>z</em>-buffering, and
you’ve got yourself a clever little program.</p>

<p>Now, we have all the pieces, but how do we write the code?  Roughly like this
(some pseudocode liberties have been taken with 2D arrays):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>const</span> <span>float</span> <span>theta_spacing</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>.</span><span>07</span><span>;</span>

<blockquote><p><em>The fish will be the last to discover water.</em><br>Modern proverb</p></blockquote>



<p>Talk to high-school students preparing for their science exams, and you’ll probably hear two things: that they’re scared of physics, and relatively comfortable with biology. Strangely, this is contrary to the view of most researchers. The scientific zeitgeist is that physics is easy. Its simplicity comes from an ability to create crystalline theories that are powerfully predictive, for everything from the existence of subatomic particles to how light bends around stars. Biology, on the other hand, is much harder to distil into elegant theorems and mathematical equations. For this reason, some eminent thinkers have <a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/black-holes-are-simpler-than-forests-and-science-has-its-limits">argued</a> that cells and forests are harder to understand than distant and difficult-to-observe black holes.</p>



<p>But perhaps there is no such thing as an easy or hard discipline. Maybe there are only easy and hard questions. Biology only <em>seems</em> so hard because it has been defined by a set of very hard questions. Physics only <em>seems</em> easy because centuries of effort by deeply insightful thinkers have produced a set of answerable questions.</p>



<p>What makes biology so challenging, ironically, is our closeness to it. Ask yourself: who is ‘easier’ to understand – a romantic crush or a work colleague? Our intimacy with biology – as well as to psychology and social science – has led us to interrogate these phenomena with profound knowledge already in hand. We ask very detailed questions, and then we’re surprised by the seemingly mysterious or contradictory answers.</p>



<p>On a walk through the forest, we might observe the unusual shapes of the foliage on a maple tree. That might lead us to wonder why the leaves have lobes, why they turn red in autumn, what insects live in the leaf litter, and how they decompose and feed the soil. These questions are deceptively complex, despite the naturalness with which we ask them. By contrast, the cold vast vacuum of space and the unseeable smallness of quarks are so foreign to us that we are proud – at least initially – to say the simplest things about these entities, even just to show that they exist.</p>



<p>Intimacy has sometimes slowed our understanding in physics, too. The question of how the planets move is one of humanity’s oldest obsessions, and runs through many different mythologies. Yet thanks to our species’ self-absorption, the longstanding theory of epicycles wrongly placed the Earth at the centre of the Universe – a mistake that persisted for around 2,000 years. When the question was abstracted to matters of force, mass and gravity in Newtonian physics, planetary motion became much easier to predict and understand.</p>



<p>There are still plenty of hard questions for physicists to puzzle over. If physics pinned its reputation on predicting the next solar flare that could interfere with telecommunications on Earth, it would be viewed as a much more complicated and difficult discipline. Why? Because modelling the many mechanisms that produce the dynamics of the Sun’s surface – all of the gravitational, electromagnetic, thermal and nuclear processes involved – is fiendishly tricky. As for planetary motion, we can get a good-enough picture of a planet’s trajectory by recognising that the massiveness of our Sun allows us to ignore the influence of other heavenly bodies. But if we really wanted to attend to these details, we’d soon find that we can’t precisely predict the motion of three bodies of equal mass. Similarly, with chaos theory, we learned that we can make only rough guesses about the specific position of two pendulums whose motion is coupled together. We cannot, however, say with certainty where either pendulum will ever be.</p>



<p>Perhaps the questions that we have demanded of biology are just too hard. How do we save an individual human life? Why is this bluejay slightly darker than the other? But just because we demand more from biology doesn’t mean we can’t pose slightly easier questions. In fact, drawing on ‘easy’ physics can help us figure out how to <em>find</em> those questions. Physicists are particularly good at looking for pervasive, large-scale phenomena that apply across multiple systems and that are likely the result of simple, shared mechanisms.</p>



<p>Take the idea of <em>biological scaling</em>. This concept stems from early observations that a mammal’s metabolic rate depends predictably and nonlinearly on body size via a <em>power law</em>. A power law is a mathematical relationship that tells us how much a feature changes as the size of the system increases by orders of magnitude (that is, by multiples of a certain number, usually 10). So when a creature’s body mass increases by 1,000-fold, the principles of biological scaling accurately predict that its metabolic rate will increase 100-fold.</p>



<p>But how can the same mathematics apply to something as simple as the gravitational pull between two objects and the messy process of speciation across diverse habitats? In physics, power laws point to shared mechanisms and symmetries that operate across all scales. In biology, our own <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000171">research</a> – as well as <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5309/122.long">that</a> of Geoffrey B West, James H Brown, and Brian J Enquist – shows that the fundamental mechanism at work is the structure and flow of vascular networks. It turns out that blood vessels tend to efficiently span the body and deliver resources to all of a creature’s cells while reducing the strain on the heart. This simple insight has given birth to a growing batch of successful theories that use the idea of an optimised biological structure to predict phenomena such as the distribution of <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/17/7040">trees in a forest</a>, how long we need to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/3/1051">sleep</a>, the rate of growth of a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022973">tumour</a>, the largest and smallest <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5281582/">sizes of bacteria</a>, and <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0020551">the tallest possible tree</a> in any environment.</p>



<p>However, biology can also give rise to its own unique questions. For example, as our colleagues <a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2109/20160338">Jessica Flack</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438816000246?via%3Dihub">David Krakauer</a> at the Santa Fe Institute have shown, the information-processing and decision-making capabilities of agents (such as primates, neurons and slime moulds) lead to unique types of feedback, adaptability and causation that differ from purely physical systems. It remains to be seen if the additional complexities of biological systems can be explained by expanding on physics-inspired perspectives such as information theory. It might be that the study of biology and complex systems in general will progress one day to insurmountably hard questions – or that a brilliant recasting of the questions will lead to the elimination of current challenges. This might show a path to easier answers, as Charles Darwin did by reformulating questions about the origins and diversity of life in terms of natural selection and variation.</p>



<figure><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/729/Aeon-Essay-Hardness-Figure-02.001.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>The complexity of systems measured along two axes: 1) the detail and precision required of the scientific description; 2) the number of mechanisms being combined in a particular phenomenon. The hardest sciences ask detailed questions about systems that are composed of many mechanisms.</figcaption></figure>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1734697?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">article</a> ‘More Is Different’ (1972), the physicist Philip Anderson highlighted the dangers of attempting to reduce everything to the most microscopic level. He focused instead on jumps in complexity that occur at various scales of natural phenomena – such as moving from quantum mechanics to chemistry. However, readers often overlook his argument that effective theories should rest on building blocks that explain the underlying mechanisms of a system – even if those building blocks are relatively large or medium-sized entities.</p>



<p>Building on this latter perspective, our argument is that we <em>don’t know</em> if black holes are simpler than forests. We <em>can’t</em> know, until we have a general effective theory that explains the existence of forests or until we can observe the most detailed dynamics of black-hole collapse and evaporation. A statement of relative complexity cannot be made without thoroughly defining the type of questions we are asking for each system. There are probably certain types of enquiries where our knowledge will hit a hard edge, but more often that’s about questions we’re posing than about the systems themselves.</p>



<p>So physics <em>can</em> be hard, and biology <em>can</em> be easy. The degree of difficulty depends more on what questions are being asked than on the field. Within complex-systems science, great advances are often made at the interface between these two perspectives. One path forward is to solve the easy questions first, and then use our answers to try to find principles that are helpful when it comes to more detailed questions and theories. It’s possible that by starting with the easy questions, we can slowly ‘build up’ to the hard ones. Or, in the opposite direction, observing the strange similarity of phenomena across disciplines might incline us to search for brand new mechanisms and principles. This will sometimes demand a less detailed, more abstract perspective – what our colleague John Miller, quoting the Nobel prizewinning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, discusses in his book <em>A Crude Look at the Whole</em> (2016). These crude looks – forced by the remoteness of physics, and obscured by the intimacy of biology – should yield many more deep insights and simplifications in science in the years to come.</p>

<p>EDGAR is the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system used by the SEC. Companies submit regulatory filings (such as quarterly reports) into the system, which are then made public for us to download. These filings are the primary focus of my research. In order to study the market reaction to them, I need to match each filing against a ticker.</p>



<h2>CIK to Ticker</h2>



<p>The SEC identifies both companies and individuals with a 10-digit central index key (CIK). I need to map that CIK to the appropriate time series in my market data (from Kibot), which are identified by ticker.</p>



<p>The starting point is the current mapping provided by the SEC: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/include/ticker.txt">tickers.txt</a>. That aligns fairly nicely with the <a href="http://www.kibot.com/historical_data/All_Stocks_Historical_Intraday_Data.aspx">Kibot ticker list</a>. Most of the effort past this point is dealing with dead tickers, which are important for reducing survivorship bias.</p>



<h2>Ticker extraction from filings</h2>



<p>I augmented my mapping by extracting tickers directly from filings where I could. Certain types of filings, 10-K and 10-Q, sometimes contain a “TradingSymbol” buried in the XBRL. But the richest sources of tickers are the ownership filings, forms 3, 4, and 5. Unfortunately, these are also the noisiest sources, since the ticker is entered by hand. Here is an example – all the unique tickers entered for NORTHWEST INDIANA BANCORP:</p>



<pre>NIWB(OB)<br>NIWIB(OB)<br>NIWIN(OB)<br>NWIB (OB)<br>NWIB(OB)<br>NWIBOB)<br>NWIIN(OB)<br>NWIN<br>NWIN (OB)<br>NWIN()B)<br>NWIN(OB<br>NWIN(OB)<br>NWIN)OB)<br>NWIN.OB<br>NWINOB</pre>



<h2>Company name matching</h2>



<p>Name matching is really tricky to get right. I decided to make <em>some</em> attempt at it, but limited it only a few hours of effort. It would take a crazy amount of work to research thousands of company histories to accurately match name variations. I’ve limited my matching to names that are identical after minor cleanup, and also names that are extremely close, but only after a cursory manual review.</p>



<h3>Levenshtein edit distance</h3>



<p>The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of edits required to turn one string into another. I used it for fuzzy name matching. Edits include character insertions, deletions, and substitutions. The edit distance can be computed using dynamic programming. Happily, I found a fast C-based implementation is readily available in python:</p>



<pre><code>conda install python-levenshtein</code></pre>



<p>For my company name matching, I looked at each EDGAR company name for which I had not yet found a ticker in the Kibot data, and I compared it to each company name listed by Kibot. I kept any pair that matched with no more than one edit. This left me with about 450 matches to review manually. I didn’t do any research on the names, but rather just went off intuition. Here are some names I think probably <em>do</em> match. One criterion I used was whether I thought one company would sue the other over too similar a name:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>MAINSTREET BANKSHARES INC</td><td>MAINSTREET BANCSHARES INC</td></tr><tr><td>ENDWAVE CORP</td><td>ENWAVE CORP</td></tr><tr><td>UREX ENERGY CORP</td><td>REX ENERGY CORP</td></tr><tr><td>CASH SYSTEMS INC</td><td>CASA SYSTEMS INC</td></tr><tr><td>TRINSIC INC</td><td>ATRINSIC INC</td></tr><tr><td>IBIZ TECHNOLOGY CORP</td><td>IBIS TECHNOLOGY CORP</td></tr><tr><td>BIDVILLE INC</td><td>KIDVILLE INC</td></tr><tr><td>JAZZ TECHNOLOGIES INC</td><td>JZZ TECHNOLOGIES INC</td></tr><tr><td>INYX INC</td><td>INX INC</td></tr><tr><td>VERIDIAN CORP</td><td>VERIDIEN CORP</td></tr><tr><td>CENTREX INC</td><td>CEMTREX INC</td></tr><tr><td>EXCELON CORP</td><td>EXELON CORP</td></tr><tr><td>TETON ADVISORS INC</td><td>TETON ADVISORRS INC</td></tr><tr><td>TELS CORP</td><td>TELUS CORP</td></tr><tr><td>TELOS CORP</td><td>TELUS CORP</td></tr><tr><td>310 HOLDINGS INC</td><td>P10 HOLDINGS INC</td></tr><tr><td>VANSEN PHARMA INC</td><td>VENSEN PHARMA INC</td></tr><tr><td>SOTECH INC</td><td>SOFTECH INC</td></tr><tr><td>SONTERRA RESOURCES INC</td><td>BONTERRA RESOURCES INC</td></tr><tr><td>FORTUNET INC</td><td>FORTINET INC</td></tr><tr><td>PANEX RESOURCES INC</td><td>PAREX RESOURCES INC</td></tr><tr><td>VIVOS INC</td><td>VIVUS INC</td></tr><tr><td>ORTEC INTERNATIONAL INC</td><td>OPTEC INTERNATIONAL INC</td></tr><tr><td>DFP HEALTHCARE ACQUISITIONS CORP</td><td>DFB HEALTHCARE ACQUISITIONS CORP</td></tr><tr><td>ZORO MINING CORP</td><td>CORO MINING CORP</td></tr><tr><td>INVESTNET INC</td><td>ENVESTNET INC</td></tr><tr><td>LINK ENERGY LLC</td><td>LINN ENERGY LLC</td></tr><tr><td>LASON INC</td><td>LAWSON INC</td></tr><tr><td>VALCOM INC</td><td>VOLCOM INC</td></tr><tr><td>REIGN SAPPHIRE CORP</td><td>REIGN SAPPPHIRE CORP</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Company name pairs I guessed DO match</figcaption></figure>



<p>And here are some very similar names I think probably <em>do not</em> match, or at least not with a likelihood that makes me comfortable:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>L3 CORP</td><td>LG CORP</td></tr><tr><td>K2 INC</td><td>K12 INC</td></tr><tr><td>RANCON REALTY FUND IV</td><td>RANCON REALTY FUND V</td></tr><tr><td>DCB FINANCIAL CORP</td><td>HCB FINANCIAL CORP</td></tr><tr><td>BLOX INC</td><td>BOX INC</td></tr><tr><td>UVIC INC</td><td>UBIC INC</td></tr><tr><td>OMEGA BRANDS INC</td><td>MEGA BRANDS INC</td></tr><tr><td>ROME BANCORP INC</td><td>HOME BANCORP INC</td></tr><tr><td>MILLS CORP</td><td>HILLS CORP</td></tr><tr><td>VINCERA INC</td><td>FINCERA INC</td></tr><tr><td>JPS INDUSTRIES INC</td><td>GPS INDUSTRIES INC</td></tr><tr><td>STEVIA CORP</td><td>STEVVA CORP</td></tr><tr><td>INNOVEX INC</td><td>INNOVET INC</td></tr><tr><td>IDENTIX INC</td><td>IDENTIV INC</td></tr><tr><td>VANS INC</td><td>EVANS INC</td></tr><tr><td>BANTA CORP</td><td>BAETA CORP</td></tr><tr><td>META GROUP INC</td><td>MEGA GROUP INC</td></tr><tr><td>LANGER INC</td><td>HANGER INC</td></tr><tr><td>SLAP INC</td><td>SNAP INC</td></tr><tr><td>COREL CORP</td><td>CORVEL CORP</td></tr><tr><td>SPECTRX INC</td><td>SPECTRA INC</td></tr><tr><td>ZEC INC</td><td>ZEP INC</td></tr><tr><td>CTD HOLDINGS INC</td><td>CT HOLDINGS INC</td></tr><tr><td>SOMO INC</td><td>DOMO INC</td></tr><tr><td>SBT BANCORP INC</td><td>S&amp;T BANCORP INC</td></tr><tr><td>CARDAX INC</td><td>CARMAX INC</td></tr><tr><td>SEEC INC</td><td>STEC INC</td></tr><tr><td>NETRO CORP</td><td>NEVRO CORP</td></tr><tr><td>GENUS INC</td><td>AGENUS INC</td></tr><tr><td>REON HOLDINGS INC</td><td>AEON HOLDINGS INC</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Company name pairs which I’m NOT sure are a match</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were a lot of borderline cases, but I hope my manual review added some value. The more I match correctly, the less likely I’ll have survivorship bias. But the more I match incorrectly, the more noise I’ll introduce into my research.</p>



<h2>Mapping by date</h2>



<p>Tickers change over time, so my ticker map is also keyed by date. I ended up doing something pretty simple. For each issuer CIK, I collect all distinct tickers, both from the official ticker mapping and from the filing extractions. Then, for each date, I look at which of any of those tickers I have market data for, and I pick the one with the most volume on the day prior to that date. I use the day before to avoid bias – high volume days tend to be associated with positive returns, which introduces a look-ahead bias. Note the implied assumption that I would want to trade the most liquid share class, even if the filing involved an insider transaction for a different share class.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>My conclusion is that I should probably have searched out a company identifier database to buy, ideally one that included daily prices and corporate actions. Years ago, I used the Compustat dataset which had CIKs. But that was about $25k/year even back then. Once I start making money, I’ll be better able to justify buying higher quality data.</p>

<p>Ok, I want to preface this article by stating that it is entirely anecdotal and based on my experience working as a doctor in the emergency room of one of the big hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden, and of living as a citizen in Sweden. As many people know, Sweden is perhaps the country that has taken the most relaxed attitude of any towards the covid pandemic. Unlike other countries, Sweden never went in to complete lockdown. Non-essential businesses have remained open, people have continued to go to cafés and restaurants, children have remained in school, and very few people have bothered with face masks in public.</p>



<p>Covid hit Stockholm like a storm in mid-March. One day I was seeing people with appendicitis and kidney stones, the usual things you see in the emergency room. The next day all those patients were gone and the only thing coming in to the hospital was covid. Practically everyone who was tested had covid, regardless of what the presenting symtom was. People came in with a nose bleed and they had covid. They came in with stomach pain and they had covid.</p>



<p>Then, after a few months, all the covid patients disappeared. It is now four months since the start of the pandemic, and I haven’t seen a single covid patient in over a month. When I do test someone because they have a cough or a fever, the test invariably comes back negative. At the peak three months back, a hundred people were dying a day of covid in Sweden, a country with a population of ten million. We are now down to around five people dying per day in the whole country, and that number continues to drop. Since people generally die around three weeks after infection, that means virtually no-one is getting infected any more. If we assume around 0.5 percent of those infected die (which I think is very generous, more on that later), then that means that three weeks back 1,000 people were getting infected per day in the whole country, which works out to a daily risk per person of getting infected of 1 in 10,000, which is miniscule. And remember, the risk of dying is at the very most 1 in 200 if you actually do get infected. And that was three weeks ago. Basically, covid is in all practical senses over and done with in Sweden. After four months.</p>



<p>In total covid has killed under 6,000 people in a country of ten million. A country with an annual death rate of around 100,000 people. Considering that 70% of those who have died of covid are over 80 years old, quite a few of those 6,000 would have died this year anyway. That makes covid a mere blip in terms of its effect on mortality.</p>



<p>That is why it is nonsensical to compare covid to other major pandemics, like the 1918 pandemic that killed tens of millions of people. Covid will never even come close to those numbers. And yet many countries have shut down their entire economies, stopped children going to school, and made large portions of their population unemployed in order to deal with this disease.</p>



<p>The media have been proclaiming that only a small percentage of the population have antibodies, and therefore it is impossible that herd immunity has developed. Well, if herd immunity hasn’t developed, where are all the sick people? Why has the rate of infection dropped so precipitously? Considering that most people in Sweden are leading their lives normally now, not socially distancing, not wearing masks, there should still be high rates of infection.</p>



<p>The reason we test for antibodies is because it is easy and cheap. Antibodies are in fact not the body’s main defence against virus infections. T-cells are. But T-cells are harder to measure than antibodies, so we don’t really do it clinically. It is quite possible to have T-cells that are specific for covid and thereby make you immune to the disease, without having any antibodies. Personally, I think this is what has happened. Everybody who works in the emergency room where I work has had the antibody test. Very few actually have antibodies. This is in spite of being exposed to huge numbers of infected people, including at the beginning of the pandemic, before we realized how widespread covid was, when no-one was wearing protective equipment.</p>



<p>I am not denying that covid is awful for the people who do get really sick or for the families of the people who die, just as it is awful for the families of people who die of cancer, or influenza, or an opioid overdose. But the size of the response in most of the world (not including Sweden) has been totally disproportionate to the size of the threat.</p>



<p>Sweden ripped the metaphorical band-aid off quickly and got the epidemic over and done with in a short amount of time, while the rest of the world has chosen to try to peel the band-aid off slowly. At present that means Sweden has one of the highest total death rates in the world. But covid is over in Sweden. People have gone back to their normal lives and barely anyone is getting infected any more. I am willing to bet that the countries that have shut down completely will see rates spike when they open up. If that is the case, then there won’t have been any point in shutting down in the first place, because all those countries are going to end up with the same number of dead at the end of the day anyway. Shutting down completely in order to decrease the total number of deaths only makes sense if you are willing to stay shut down until a vaccine is available. That could take years. No country is willing to wait that long.</p>



<p>Covid has at present killed less than 6000 in Sweden. It is very unlikely that the number of dead will go above 7,000. An average influenza year in Sweden, 700 people die of influenza. Does that mean covid is ten times worse than influenza? No, because influenza has been around for centuries while covid is completely new. In an average influenza year most people already have some level of immunity because they’ve been infected with a similar strain previously, or because they’re vaccinated. So it is quite possible, in fact likely, that the case fatality rate for covid is the same as for influenza, or only slightly higher, and the entire difference we have seen is due to the complete lack of any immunity in the population at the start of this pandemic. </p>



<p>This conclusion makes sense of the Swedish fatality numbers – if we’ve reached a point where there is hardly any active infection going on any more in Sweden in spite of the fact that there is barely any social distancing happening then that means at least 50% of the population has been infected already and have developed immunity, which is five million people. This number is perfectly reasonable if we assume a reproductive number for the virus of two: If each person infects two new, with a five day period between being infected and infecting others, and you start out with just one infected person in the country, then you will reach a point where several million are infected in just four months. If only 6000 are dead out of five million infected, that works out to a case fatality rate of 0.12 percent, roughly the same as regular old influenza, which no-one is the least bit frightened of, and which we don’t shut down our societies for.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>In past projects at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> we had an application that typically ran with <strong>~2GB</strong> in memory at any given time. By simply changing the order of some <code>uint</code> variables we managed to drop the memory usage to less than <strong>1.4GB</strong>. The vast majority of this allocated memory is due to an enormous slice of <code>stats</code> structs.</p>



<p>The <code>stats</code> struct has the following type definition:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>In theory, this struct will take a use a measly 4 bytes. Each <code>uint8</code> uses 1 <code>byte</code>, and the single <code>uint16</code> needs 2. We began to suspect that we had some wasteful memory issues, so I built the following little program to show how memory is being used by our struct:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"runtime"
)

type stats struct {
	NumPosts uint8
	Reach    uint16
	NumLikes uint8
}

func main() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(stats{})
	fmt.Printf("Struct is %d bytes long\n", typ.Size())
	n := typ.NumField()
	for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {
		field := typ.Field(i)
		fmt.Printf("%s at offset %v, size=%d, align=%d\n",
			field.Name, field.Offset, field.Type.Size(),
			field.Type.Align())
	}

	allStats := []stats{}
	for i := 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++ {
		allStats = append(allStats, stats{})
	}

	printMemUsage()
}

func printMemUsage() {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&amp;m)
	fmt.Printf("Alloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Alloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tTotalAlloc = %v MiB", bToMb(m.TotalAlloc))
	fmt.Printf("\tSys = %v MiB", bToMb(m.Sys))
	fmt.Printf("\tNumGC = %v\n", m.NumGC)
}

func bToMb(b uint64) uint64 {
	return b / 1024 / 1024
}</code></pre>



<p>On my MacBook using Go 1.14.1 the above program prints:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 6 bytes long
NumPosts at offset 0, size=1, align=1
Reach at offset 2, size=2, align=2
NumLikes at offset 4, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 1084 MiB        TotalAlloc = 3012 MiB   Sys = 2713 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>Notice that even though <code>NumPosts</code> only has a size of 1 byte, the next field, <code>Reach</code>, still starts at offset 2. A whole byte is being wasted! The same thing happens with the <code>NumLikes</code> field, it starts at offset 4 with a size of 1, but the struct still takes up the full 6 bytes.</p>



<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but when you are storing millions of these structs in memory the bloat starts to add up quick.</p>



<p>If we change the <code>stats</code> struct such that the <code>uint16</code> isn’t defined between the <code>uint8</code>s:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">type stats struct {
	Reach    uint16
	NumPosts uint8
	NumLikes uint8
}</code></pre>



<p>Then the output of the program becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">Struct is 4 bytes long
Reach at offset 0, size=2, align=2
NumPosts at offset 2, size=1, align=1
NumLikes at offset 3, size=1, align=1
Alloc = 694 MiB TotalAlloc = 1927 MiB   Sys = 1391 MiB  NumGC = 19</code></pre>



<p>The total allocated memory drops from 3 GB to less than 2, and each instance of the struct now only uses 4 bytes.</p>



<h2>Why?</h2>



<p>Modern CPU hardware performs reads and writes to memory most efficiently when the data is&nbsp;<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally aligned</a></em>. The memory that is stored side by side should be accessible using a common multiple, so the Go compiler makes sure that it is.</p>



<p>With our first struct, the Reach field is between the NumPosts and NumLikes fields, which means that the compiler will add some padding to keep things nice and even. </p>

<p>In our updated struct however, we have grouped the smaller fields, and since they add up to the same amount of memory as the larger <code>Reach</code> field we can save some space!</p>

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><strong>Quote of the Day</strong> is a simple protocol that is used to deliver daily
quotes. Although its usage is almost nonexistent these days, there are still a
few public servers. The protocol is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc865">RFC
865</a>. According to the RFC, a QOTD server is
run on <strong>port 17</strong> for TCP and UDP connections.</p>

<p>The RFC recommends that;</p>

<ul>
  <li>The quotes should be limited to the ASCII printable characters, spaces and
newlines.</li>
  <li>They should be less than 512 characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the protocol is only used to send quotes to terminals, these aren’t hard
requirements. But a server should still follow these recommendations in order to
be compatible with the other servers and clients.</p>

<p>Despite the name being Quote of the <em>Day</em>, a server does not have to serve
daily quotes. It can change the quote at any interval or send random quotes at
each connection.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-connections">TCP Connections</h2>

<p>When a QOTD server gets a connection, it sends a quote and closes the
connection, discarding any received data. Basically, a server should do the
following</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen to connections on port <code>17</code>.</li>
  <li>Accept a connection.</li>
  <li>Choose a random quote.</li>
  <li>Send the quote to the client.</li>
  <li>Close the connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="udp-connections">UDP Connections</h2>

<p>A UDP server is a bit different from a TCP one. Since UDP has no concept of
<em>connections</em>, a server just sends the quote after getting a UDP datagram.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen to UDP datagrams on port <code>17</code>.</li>
  <li>When you get a UDP packet:
    <ul>
      <li>Discard any data in the packet.</li>
      <li>Send a UDP datagram containing the quote back to the client.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

Along this journey, the nature of the techniques used has shifted from fixed-pipeline algorithms based mostly in heuristics and little data to resource-intensive general-purpose models that require both heavy computing power and a lot of data. This shift, while unlocking new capabilities, presents some drawbacks.</p><p>Most of the work done at the research level is fragmented because researchers, by the very nature of good research, need to focus on one aspect at a time when planning their experiments. And while there are papers on unifying techniques, the difficulty to evaluate, and the requirements on what a novel contribution is being so stringent, these are few and apart. Most of these works come from non-academic initiatives such as <a href="http://fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>.</p><p>The objective of research is to present and validate a novel approach to a problem. Being that their end goal, the focus is on results and the published paper, not on the code used to run those experiments. Even when code is made publicly available, more often than not, it tends to be hard to extend, optimize, or integrate with other pieces of code.</p><p>Commercially available APIs may solve this issue since they are usually easy to use and integrate. However, they come with another set of problems.</p><p>First and foremost, code is not auditable. Since they are commercial solutions, code is not open source, so you cannot be certain what the code is doing. You may trust the company you are working with, but that may not be enough for other stakeholders. Plus, it is always nice to be able to check what is being done. Also, since they are usually cloud solutions, you have to share your data with them. This is a no-go for some companies, since the data may be somewhat sensitive.</p><p>There are some great services by some big-name companies, which may work fine for some set of problems. Nevertheless, their "best" models remain behind closed door. In addition to this, the technique that it is used may be unknown. While you can easily use Amazon Rekognition or Google Vision AI, you can't know what's under the hood. This may be fine for some scenarios, but for other cases you may need to have a sense of in which cases the solution fails, or which biases it has.</p><p>We believe that there's a place for an open-source initiative focusing on addressing the above
points.</p><p>That's where <a href="https://terran-project.com/">Terran</a> comes in.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-faces.png" alt="Terran Face Detection"></p><p>An example of Face Detection made with Terran</p><p>An open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>We strive for code that is easy to integrate and understand. While it is open-source, it is not specifically targeted for researchers. We want to make computer vision accessible to anyone who can code, and enable them to create innovative applications. To achieve this, Terran was built with these guiding principles in mind:</p><ul><li>A self-explanatory API that tells you what you are doing.</li><li>No intricate configuration files.</li><li>Simplest I/O operations for any kind of videos and images.</li></ul><p>The focus is on being a production-grade library, not a toy project. Only models whose performance can be assessed and with reasonable (and knowable) computational and memory requirements will be included.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-poses.png" alt="Terran Pose Estimation"></p><p>An example of Pose Estimation using Terran</p><p>Let's see a small example of what we can build with it.</p><p>We could do our own image album creator grouping photos of the same people. That's a use case that all cloud providers (such as Google Photos and Apple Photos) do. For the sake of keeping it simple and focusing on Terran, lets do the core of this problem: finding on which photos someone is present.</p><p>We will start with some imports:</p><pre><pre><code>import click

from pathlib import Path
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

from terran.face import extract_features, face_detection
from terran.io import open_image, resolve_images
from terran.vis import display_image, vis_faces
</code></pre></pre><p>We will use <code>click</code> to create a small CLI tool (we love click — highly recommended). We will use <code>pathlib</code> to handle paths and a measure of distance from <code>scipy</code>. Finally, we import some functions from Terran's modules: from face, core functions to detect faces and extract features; from io, utility functions to resolve paths and open images; from vis, some visualization functions (extremely important and useful when working with images!).</p><ol><li>from <code>terran.face</code>, we import core functions to detect and extract features from faces</li><li>from <code>terran.io</code>, utility functions to resolve paths and open images</li><li>and finally, from <code>terran.vis</code>, we import some visualization functions that are extremely important and useful when working with images!</li></ol><p>Now we will create a function that deals with the problem of finding the photos where a person is present. You'll see how easy it is with Terran!</p><pre><pre><code>@click.command(name='match-dir')
@click.argument('reference')
@click.argument('image-dir')
@click.option('--batch-size', type=int, default=1)
@click.option('--threshold', type=float, default=0.5)
@click.option('--display', is_flag=True, default=False)
def match_directory(reference, image_dir, batch_size, threshold, display):

    reference = open_image(reference)
    faces_in_reference = face_detection(reference)

    if len(faces_in_reference) != 1:
        click.echo('Reference image must have exactly one face.')
        return

    ref_feature = extract_features(reference, faces_in_reference[0])
</code></pre></pre><p>Our function takes in two arguments: a reference image and a directory where we should scan the photos. Then, our first step is to get a set of features out of our reference image that represents the person we are looking for.</p><p>Then, we get the paths to all of the images that we will be scanning:</p><pre><pre><code>    paths = resolve_images(
        Path(image_dir).expanduser(),
        batch_size=batch_size
    )
</code></pre></pre><p>This Terran function gives paths in batches, so you can process them in parallel (if needed).</p><p>So the only thing remaining to do is, for each image, open it, detect the faces, get the features, and compare it with our reference image. Easy enough with Terran!</p><pre><pre><code>    for batch_paths in paths:
        # Open them
        batch_images = list(map(open_image, batch_paths))

        # Detect the faces
        faces_per_image = face_detection(batch_images)

        # Get the features
        features_per_image = extract_features(batch_images, faces_per_image)

        for path, image, faces, features in zip(
            batch_paths, batch_images, faces_per_image, features_per_image
        ):
            for face, feature in zip(faces, features):
                # Compare each feature with our reference feature
                confidence = cosine(ref_feature, feature)

                # If it is a match print it / display it!
                if confidence &lt; threshold:
                    click.echo(f'{path}, confidence = {confidence:.2f}')
                    if display:
                        display_image(vis_faces(image, face))
</code></pre></pre><p>All the code together:</p><pre><pre><code>import click

from pathlib import Path
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

from terran.face import extract_features, face_detection
from terran.io import open_image, resolve_images
from terran.vis import display_image, vis_faces

@click.command(name='match-dir')
@click.argument('reference')
@click.argument('image-dir')

    reference = open_image(reference)
    faces_in_reference = face_detection(reference)
    if len(faces_in_reference) != 1:
        click.echo('Reference image must have exactly one face.')
        return
    ref_feature = extract_features(reference, faces_in_reference[0])

    paths = resolve_images(
        Path(image_dir).expanduser(),
        batch_size=batch_size
    )
    for batch_paths in paths:

        faces_per_image = face_detection(batch_images)
        features_per_image = extract_features(batch_images, faces_per_image)

        for path, image, faces, features in zip(
            batch_paths, batch_images, faces_per_image, features_per_image
        ):
            for face, feature in zip(faces, features):
                confidence = cosine(ref_feature, feature)
                if confidence &lt; threshold:
                    click.echo(f'{path}, confidence = {confidence:.2f}')
                    if display:
                        display_image(vis_faces(image, face))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    match_directory()
</code></pre></pre><p>With just a few lines of code, you can easily check in which images you are present! From your computer, not needing to upload them anywhere, and tweaking the parameters to fit your case (take a look at threshold). You can also take a look at this example in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/terran/blob/master/examples/match.py">Github</a>, and to the rest of Terran and see how it works.</p><p>Right now, Terran has models for Face Detection, Face Recognition, and Pose Estimation. We think that several applications can be created using these features, like controlling your computer with body gestures or changing what gets displayed depending on the presence of a face or not. You can use Terran as an interface to interact to your computer with your body, among several other ideas that one could think of.</p><p>In the future, we plan to:</p><ul><li>Add more models for these same problems, but that are more lightweight, in case you need it to run on a small device.</li><li>Add other models to tackle other problems, e.g. segmentation.</li><li>Add the functionality to train or fine-tune the existing models.</li></ul><p>While this is our current roadmap, feel free to create an issue on github to tell us if you'd like us to work on …</p></article></main></div></div></div></div>

          <p><span>No one can tell in advance whether an idea will work. If someone tells you your idea is terrible, all you know is that one of you is wrong.</span></p> <p><span>I am a believer in learning by doing, and doing so in public. Simply building something and putting it out there is motivation that keeps me going. Creating is not just one of the most effective means of learning. It is an outlet of expression. </span> <em>A source of joy</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>Through the act of creating, my preferences </span> <em>reveal themselves</em> <span> and </span> <em>evolve</em> <span>. I have gotten to know myself better through my creations. My goal has not been to build a wildly successful product. Rather, I simply try to be prolific. As </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung/status/1291025563977687047" target="_blank"><span>Sahil Lavingia puts it</span></a> <span>, </span> <em>the real product I'm working on is my own brain</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>Below is a collection of some of the projects I have worked on. Many of them are </span> <em>embarrassingly stupid, </em> <span>with project names almost as bad as the ideas themselves</span> <em>. </em> <span>And others, I may one day revisit and revive with a fuller skill stack.</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully this makes you feel less self-conscious about how low a bar you can set. </span> <em>Just tinker and create, and have fun doing it</em> <span>. Better yet, I hope this sparks new ideas for your projects.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Talking to users, as a service (2020)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>A white-glove service for validating your ideas for you by interviewing your target users. Life is too short to work on products no one cares about. This is an attempt to package my lessons (learned mostly the hard way) and experience into a useful service</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Roadmap for learning to code, A mini-course (2020)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>This is my first online course, to help people who are learning to code make progress and get unstuck. </span> <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/CodeFun" target="_blank"><span>I</span></a> <span>t is common for people to get overwhelmed and give up in their coding journey, which is sad because of all the wasted potential.</span></p> <p><span>Here I share an approach that has served me over the years, helping me land the opportunities I wanted, while having a blast.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Community knowledge base for BJJ (2020)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>Until recently, I had been a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu fanatic, sometimes training multiple times a day. This is my contribution to the BJJ community, helping organizing the myriad techniques into a easily navigable and queryable knowledge base. </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/bjj.png"></p>   <p><h3><span>Graph-based knowledge management for online learnings (2020)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>I was exploring building tools for extending the mind, and started working on </span> <a href="https://getrumin.com/" target="_blank"><span>Rumin</span></a> <span>, just before Roam Research exploded onto the scene. Built it to solve my own problems. And now iterating to help others do the same.</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiC2w7pPuuI?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Building a Chef's Brain (2019)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>At one point, I was obsessed with culinary knowledge and discovering new flavors. And I naively thought, what if we codify our collective culinary knowledge and model a chef's intuition? I ingested various types food-related data from disparate sources, and tried collect data to </span> <em>infer the inner emotional state of the diner</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>Very reductionist, and useless in practice, I know. This idea was driven purely by my imagination, without a concrete use case (or user) in mind...I will return to it at some point though, as a passion project.</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/hack4.png"></p>  <p><h3><span>Directory of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) (2017)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>This ICO listing site was my attempt to sell shovels in the crypto gold rush in 2017. Had a few thousand monthly visits at the peak of the ICO craze.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Dropshipping (2017)</span></h3></p> <p><span>This was my first foray into e-Commerce. Started multiple Shopify stores to systematically test product ideas. The model was simple: find product ideas, run ads, fulfill orders by dropshipping. </span></p>   <p><h3><span>Yelp, for finding the best dishes (2015)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>Worked on this when I was in Tokyo. Back then, I wanted to try </span> <em>"the best of X dish"</em> <span> . If I'm going to eat it, why not go to the place that does it best? </span></p> <p><span>Yelp and Google didn't make that easy at the time. So I set out to build my own. The most unique part of my app was a voting mechanism: asking users to vote between two places (that they have been to) that make a given dish.</span></p> <p><em>EDIT: Looks like the app is returning an error... :(</em></p>  <p><h3><span>Airbnb, for renting sports equipment (2015)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>At the height of the sharing economy fad, I thought "why can't I rent my skis from strangers instead of the ski resort"? I jumped on the idea. Did zero research. And the project died after only a handful of users checked it out (and never came back).</span></p> <p><span>But hey, this one got me an internship in Tokyo without even interviewing :)</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Look up full phrases (2014)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>When learning a language, you can't look up an entire phrase. So I built an app for that. Google translate didn't work so well back then. My app was supposed to fill the gap with native speaker-verified phrase pairs.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Iron Man Simulator (2014)</span></h3></p> <p><span>Fly around Google Earth using gesture control (powered by Leap Motion).</span></p> <p><span>This was entirely for fun. A hackathon project. </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjue_QtyW1o?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Gesture-controlled AR in video chat (2014)</span></h3></p> <p><span>Overlay augmented reality objects over video. Hackathon project, didn't end up turning it into a product.</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imDpZ92Iuck?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Checking body fat percentage using computer vision (2014)</span></h3></p> <p><span>Most methods of measuring body fat are unreliable. Fitness experts would often just "eyeball" it. This was my attempt train a model to do the expert's job.</span></p> <p><span>Did not work very well....</span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWwYHN15_zU?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Stitching normal photos into a 360 photo (2014) </span></h3></p> <p><span>My attempt to stitch regular 2D photos into a 360 one. The proof-of-concept worked well enough. But I didn't end up turning it into a product. </span></p> <div><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpBTMIxA1g0?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p></div>  <p><h3><span>Startup foundry (2014)</span></h3></p>  <p><span>As my friends and I were having all these cool project ideas, we thought we could form a studio to keep churning out mini-startups.

<p>by Bill Atkinson, as told to Leo Laporte</p>
<p>In 1985 I swallowed a tiny fleck of gelatin containing a medium dose of LSD, and I spent most of the night sitting on a concrete park bench outside my home in Los Gatos, California.</p>

<p>I gazed up at a hundred billion galaxies each with a hundred billion stars, and each star a giant thermonuclear fusion reaction as powerful as our Sun. And for the first time in my life I knew deep down inside that we are not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I knew that life on planet Earth is not the only pocket of consciousness in the universe, and likely not the most advanced. But we still have a role to play in the unfolding drama of creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed to me the universe is in a process of coming alive. Consciousness is blossoming and propagating to colonize the universe, and life on Earth is one of many bright spots in the cosmic birth of consciousness.</p>

<p>But the stars are separated by enormous distances of darkness and vacuum, which may hinder communication between them. I lowered my gaze and saw the street lamps below glowing brightly, each casting a pool of light but surrounded by darkness before the next lamp. As above, so below.</p>

<p>The street lamps reminded me of bodies of knowledge, gems of discovery and understanding, but separated from each other by distance and different languages. Poets, artists, musicians, physicists, chemists, biologists, mathmeticians, and economists all have separate pools of knowledge, but are hindered from sharing and finding the deeper connections.</p>

<p>My vision distorted by thick eyeglasses, I witnessed the curvature of the Earth’s horizon, and I felt the pull of gravity toward its center, such that every one of us is standing at the very apex. Each of us stands at the top of planet Earth, and each of us is a leader or captain of the “Blue Marble” team.</p>

<p>How could I help? By focusing on the weak link. If I were captain of a soccer team, I would look for the weak link and work on it. If the goalie was letting too many through, I would spend extra practice time with him, and the whole team would prosper.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the weak link for the Blue Marble team is wisdom. Humanity has achieved sufficient technological power to change the course of life and the entire global ecosystem, but we seem to lack the perspective to choose wisely between alternative futures. But I was young, without much life experience or wisdom myself.</p>

<p>Knowledge, it seemed to me, consists of the “How” connections between pieces of information, the cause and effect relationships. How does this action bring about that result. Science is a systematic attempt to discover the “How” connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wisdom, it seemed to me, was a step further removed, the bigger perspective of the “Why” connections between pieces of knowledge. Why, for reasons ethical and aesthetic, should we choose one future over another?</p>

<p>I thought if we could encourage sharing of ideas between different areas of knowledge, perhaps more of the bigger picture would emerge, and eventually more wisdom might develop. Sort of a trickle-up theory of information leading to knowledge leading to wisdom.</p>

<p>This was the underlying inspiration for HyperCard, a multimedia authoring environment that empowered non-programmers to share ideas using new interactive media called HyperCard stacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each card in a HyperCard stack included graphics, text, interactive buttons, and links that took you to another card or stack. Built-in painting tools, drag-and-drop authoring with a library of pre-fab buttons and fields, and simple event based scripting made HyperCard flexible and easy to use.</p>

<p>It took a lot of hard work and a dedicated team to complete this mission. Apple shipped HyperCard in August 1987, and included it free with every Mac so any user could create and share HyperCard stacks. Many creative people expressed their ideas and passions, and several million interactive HyperCard stacks were created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HyperCard was a precurser to the first web browser, except chained to a hard drive before the worldwide web. Six years later Mosaic was introduced, influenced by some of the ideas in HyperCard, and indirectly by an inspiring LSD experience.</p>

<p><em>Leo Laporte did a great interview with me in April 2016. You can <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/triangulation/episodes/247?autostart=false">watch it here</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp; with the part about hypercard inspiration starting at 22:43&nbsp;</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1596817511541" id="item-5f2d800ee99e336759aabd3c"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e8c1e43fbaf39c964f47"><div><p>11 years ago when I was doing my first ever tech project, which turned into my startup that self-taught me everything and started my tech career, I remember finding out about analytics tools and being blown away. “You mean you can find out exactly where users are dropping off, which features they use the most, and essentially gauge how happy they are with specific features?”</p><p>As I went on in my career, working at various startups as a UX Designer with Product Management duties, I was surprised to see how underutilized these analytics tools were. I thought “oh it’s because they’re just a scrappy startup”. They seemed like something every startup had installed, because they’re supposed to, but never actually used. When I started working as a Product Manager working with a Y Combinator team that had just been acquired into a bigger corporation, ‘scrappy startup’ was no longer an excuse in my mind as to why user analytics was under utilized. In this case I realized it’s because as one of a few Product Managers for a banking iPhone, Android, mobile web, and web app, there just wasn’t enough time to balance all the agile meetings and feature requests from c-level executives, developers, the marketing team, app store user feedback, and also make data based product decisions.</p><p>For the last 5 years I’ve been working with various Fortune 500 and startups, and I’ve also noticed that at best “yes, we track analytics and everything is installed, yes, we want to be data driven but no, we haven’t actually looked at our data in a way to guide product decisions”. Maybe I just haven’t come across a company that has the culture of being truly data driven, but otherwise I have some theories as to why user analytics data is underutilized in product decision making.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Not enough bandwidth for product managers to analyze and make sense of data</p></li><li><p>Analytics tracking gets out-dated with every new iteration and feature</p></li><li><p>Data doesn’t feel statistically significant</p></li><li><p>Too many questions on “how” to interpret the data</p></li></ul><p>As a part of UX consulting, I have been conducting usability tests, and have found that a simple Net Promoter Score survey on each user test is an easy way to gauge improvements upon each iteration of the clickable prototype or product shown in the user test. For example when there is a 2 point jump with every 5 user tests, the latest iteration, without a doubt, is much better.</p><p>So I came up with a hypothesis, what if products ran NPS surveys, within various sections of their product, and maybe even compared the NPS scores against each other. Since it’s one data point, there isn’t a need for much bandwidth for interpretation. Since NPS is a type of qualitative data, they don’t need much traffic for it to have statistical significance. Since it’s simple, “how” to interpret the data doesn’t become a point of argument.</p><p>I looked online and found some solutions that provide this functionality, but found them too complex in terms of user experience or pricing, or they lacked the capability to measure NPS scores contextually.</p><p>So I built a basic minimal viable product to test this hypothesis, Userglee.com for <a href="http://www.userglee.com/"><span>actionable Net Promoter Scores</span></a>. There is a lot I can add to it and a lot of directions I can take it, but currently looking for feedback on the bare-bones MVP to see if there is anything worth pursuing further.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>If you’ve used a web app in the last decade, you’ve probably signed in using <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>. Clicked “Sign in with Twitter” or built an integration to allow users to sign in with Google? That’s SSO. SSO is a popular authentication mechanism that’s enabled application developers to register and sign in users easily, while allowing users to use a single service for their identity. Implementing SSO enables users to sign in using their Google credentials rather than remembering passwords for another service. </p><p>While SSO authentication lowers the barrier to entry to your product, it also presents new user experiences as you start to consider the actual mechanics of signing into your application. The SSO handshake involves validation between two parties - the Identity Provider (e.g. Okta) and the service provider (e.g. your app). Enterprise users now have two unique flows to sign into your application - via an Identity Provider (IdP) initiated flow or via a Service Provider (SP) initiated flow. &nbsp;</p></div><h2>IdP-initiated SSO</h2><div><p>SSO Identity Providers typically offer an application marketplace / dashboard that shows an enterprise user all of the applications they have access to. For example, Okta offers a browser extension that provides a quick way to see and sign in to the applications you have access to. IdP-initiated sign on is when an enterprise user clicks on your application from one of these places. The sign-on is initiated by the IdP provider, hence it’s called “IdP-initiated SSO.”</p></div><figure id="w-node-72914696f046-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c523fead65f22b3c3b05a_SSO_Hero_Image-Desktop_Mobile.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Your Okta application dashboard might look like this (<a href="https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A Service Provider cannot solely rely on IdP-initiated sign on for users to access their application. Some Identity Providers don’t support IdP-initiated sign on and some app developers don’t build in the ability to use IdP-initiated sign on. On the other hand, consider the user experience of enterprise users who come directly to your website wanting to use your application. Only allowing IdP-initiated SSO requires users to always go through their Identity Provider dashboard, something users may forget. <br></p><h2>SP-initiated SSO</h2><p>Service Provider initiated sign on is when an enterprise user signs in by visiting an application’s website directly. If you decide to allow your enterprise users to sign in to your application from your own website, you have a few UX options, but one aspect is absolutely crucial no matter what you chose to do: <em>you must obtain an enterprise user’s domain</em>. The domain is used to map the user to the enterprise - without it, how will you know which user belongs to which enterprise? There's a few different approaches to Service Provider initiated sign on that we commonly see utilized by applications:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Subdomaining tenants</li><li>Signing in with SSO</li><li>Separating the email and password fields</li><li>Dynamic password fields <br></li></ul><h3>Subdomain your tenants</h3><p>One approach you can take would be to serve your application at a subdomain per tenant / enterprise. Slack is one web application that does this. When you visit <a href="https://slack.com/">slack.com</a> and click on the Sign In button, you’re taken to this page:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c5283468662a73c040719_image%20(7).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If we consider WorkOS here, a WorkOS employee would enter <strong><em>workos</em></strong> into the input, Slack looks up what sign in options are allowed for <strong><em>workos</em></strong>, and on the next page offers the user the various methods their organization may use for signing in.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52a7ead65f409ac413a7_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-04%20at%201.09.57%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Sign in with SSO</h3><p>A second approach would be to put a link or button on your login page for <strong><em>Sign in with SSO</em></strong>. One thing to remember is the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR Problem</a> - where a cluster of 3rd party branded buttons creates both visual noise and confusion on behalf of the user.<br></p><figure id="w-node-3086f52aa857-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c52c519f125323b9f5a1a_0_4fYlCDFKodWOMQlX.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>That’s a lot of login buttons! (<a href="https://medium.com/code-oil/oauth-introduction-for-busy-managers-engineers-d9d792504888">Source</a>) </figcaption></figure><p>Cypress takes this approach, but is careful to only offer a couple of sign in options that are relevant to their user base:<br></p><figure id="w-node-df6971397a76-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c710a9c652c0f3c9af534_image%20(8).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicking the Single Sign-On link takes you here:<br></p><figure id="w-node-9d11dcad3940-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c71b0260f332d32d30720_image%20(9).png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Separate email / password fields</h3><p>Take a look at the initial login screens of two of the world’s largest tech companies. Notice anything missing?<br></p><figure id="w-node-d7f7ce9329f4-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72843b75e571dba65898_image%20(10).png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Where is the password field?</figcaption></figure><p>They separate the login process into multiple steps or pages. When signing into Apple’s developer portal, it first asks only for your email then your password, because between the steps, Apple is doing a lookup to see if your domain is SSO-enabled. If it is SSO-enabled, instead of showing your password, it will take you though the SSO flow instead. Here at WorkOS, we even use it for our login page.<br></p><figure id="w-node-ecfa60f44263-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72a49fd1df81c7694b71_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-03%20at%2012.56.18%20PM.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Dynamically hide the password field<br></h3><p>An extension to the previous approach is dynamically hiding the password field - but only for domains which have SSO enabled. This is a bit more complicated to implement, but it provides a nicer and more “unified” user experience. An example of this style is implemented on the Dropbox login form. <br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f2c72b88e63c617c8e4154e_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>Disclaimer: Please, don’t try to hack into Marc’s Dropbox account because you see this gif. </figcaption></figure><div><p>Dropbox has implemented SSO, but that’s not immediately apparent from their login screen. As a user, for example <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="cba6aab9a88bb8aaa7aeb8ada4b9a8aee5a8a4a6">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>, types their email into the respective field,&nbsp;a search is being executed on the backend on every keypress to check if a matching SSO-enabled domain exists. Once a match is found, the password experience is replaced with the <strong><em>Single sign-on enabled</em></strong> flow. Now, the user just clicks <strong><em>Continue</em></strong> to sign in.</p><p>In our opinion, this is the smoothest SSO UI/UX, but again, we understand it’s more work to implement and test.</p></div><h2>The SSO journey doesn’t end here</h2><div><p>Adding SSO doesn’t mean you can get rid of usernames and passwords altogether. Users without SSO-based login still need some way to access your product. Even with SSO-enabled accounts, admin users need to be able to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#implementing-a-backdoor">login using username / password</a> so they can configure SSO for all users or get into the system in the event SSO isn’t working. </p><p>Your login page is the gate to your application, and it’s important to make it a polished experienced. A third-party service like <a href="https://workos.com/features/sso">WorkOS</a> can help you build it faster so you can focus on the details.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
We have talked a fair <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/what-is-mrna-vaccine.html">amount</a> <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/07/antibody-hope-in-sars-cov-2.html">about</a> antibodies, and much of the SARS-CoV-2 discussion is focused on antibodies as indicators, treatments, or vaccines. However, antibodies produced by B-cells are only one part of the larger immune picture, albeit one of the most accessible parts. To develop a comprehensive treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2, we will likely need to understand how the broader network of immune cells responds to the virus. Today, we’ll take a closer look at the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and what it says about long-term immunity.
</p>
<h3>A robust T cell response</h3>


<p>
A brief refresher: T cells, <a href="https://www.hellovirology.com/2020/06/adaptive-immune-cells.html">you may remember</a>, are adaptive immune cells. Each T cell has a unique T cell receptor that recognizes a different set of foreign peptides, and if a T cell’s receptor is activated, that T cell clones itself and produces an army of similar T cells capable of fighting off the invader that was recognized. T cells come in several varieties, the two most prominent of which are CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells are responsible for surveying peptides (that is, short protein fragments) presented by antigen-presenting cells like B cells and macrophages and starting a signaling cascade that activates the rest of the immune system, and are thus referred to as “helper” T cells. CD8+ T cells survey peptides presented by normal tissue cells throughout the body, and, if they recognize one of the presented peptides as foreign, they kill the cell under the assumption that it has been infected. CD8+ T cells are thus called “killer” T cells.</p><p><img height="441" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VHihcE0ie5EooWOw2mc8MzfuYgaOlru5R7lLNl22U_DTENRS9eBrKdPNZd1a0q609Hhyl7WZLuQpw8lVU3fO2ZsWAYwdT_anu_JpkUAMOyP1IkBQ_TGsvrYS4geTdOtRC1TVjQLU=w499-h441" width="499"></p><p>Given these critical roles in immune system activation, scientists are studying the extent to which CD4+ and CD8+ T cells recognize peptides from SARS-CoV-2. In <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">one recent paper</a>, Grifoni et al. created pools of peptides that tile the entire set of proteins that make up SARS-CoV-2. In one pool, they created a peptide for every set of 15 amino acids from the Spike protein, tiled such that each length-15 chain overlapped by ten amino acids with the next peptide in the pool. In another pool, they computationally predicted which peptides would be efficiently held by antigen presenting cells like macrophages, and made peptides that covered the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A similar pool was made for the peptides predicted to be efficiently held in the MHC class I molecules that CD8+ T cells recognize.</p> <p><img height="250" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zUoM8PrduU9w1Tw6QW9QYVvR_PE7ctTnUvJyqoBkLcEO6jqFuuZwkc97g5hStxr7hNOl4ceN3bcB4PBHx0GrHLioF1cOAWLW9-eK3K7Xk6U_rw-ZTmx9oj5FiyisoABi1VRZ7fYv" width="241"></p><p>
Scientists regularly create overlapping peptides that tile proteins of interest when studying which pieces of a protein immune cells recognize. This is a generic example showing overlap strategies from Mimotopes.com, a company that creates and sells custom peptides.
</p>
<p>
To test out the effects of these peptide pools, the researchers collected blood from patients who tested positive for COVID-19 but were not hospitalized, 20 - 35 days after symptom onset. The researchers extracted the Peripheral Mononuclear Blood Cells (PBMCs) from the blood, as these include circulating T cells and other immune cells, and then ran a series of experiments to see how the T cells responded to the peptide pools. The number of patients was small (20 patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and 20 unexposed controls), but even so, the results were consistent: all recovered COVID-19 patients showed evidence of a robust T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. 100% of patients had CD4+ T cells that recognized and became activated in response to peptides from the Spike pool as well as peptides from the non-Spike peptide pool. These activated cells were able to produce inflammatory cytokines (immune signaling molecules) and to quickly clone themselves. The response of the patients’ CD8+ T cells was less universal, but still robust: 70% of patients had CD8+ T cells that were activated in response to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. 
</p>
<h3>Memories of infections past</h3>


<p>
What does this T cell response mean? For starters, it indicates that recovered COVID-19 patients have a stronghold of “memory” T cells— T cells that have seen SARS-CoV-2 and learned its patterns so that they are ready to respond more quickly in the future. It’s unclear whether these T cells are able to confer long-term immunity for the patients, but there is some evidence that they might: another paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z">Le Bert et al.</a> ran a similar set of peptide/T cell experiments, but they were able to include a set of long-recovered SARS-CoV-1 patients. They found that even after 17 years, these patients had T cells that were able to quickly respond to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 peptides, which gives us hope that T cell memory of SARS-CoV-2 will be similarly long-lived.
</p>
<p>
These cross-reactive T cells were not limited to SARS-CoV-1 patients, either. Both Grifoni et al. and Le Bert et al. used PBMCs drawn from donors without any exposure to COVID as controls, but these unexposed controls proved more interesting than the “zero baseline” we might have expected, as up to 50% of the unexposed controls showed some degree of reactivity to peptides from SARS-CoV-2, though these reactions were skewed toward the non-spike peptide pools. The researchers reason this is likely due to previous exposure to coronaviruses that cause common colds, and indeed, all unexposed controls had antibodies for two common coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63. If true, this cross-reactivity between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 could explain some of the variability in severity of COVID-19 across different people; some immune systems may already be primed to react to SARS-CoV-2 by prior infections. Further, given that the cross-reactive responses were more pronounced for non-spike proteins, this finding lends support to the idea that we should have a multi-target approach to vaccination and treatment, rather than a Spike-only approach.
</p>
<p>
(We should pause for a moment here to address a nagging question: wait, if even the unexposed controls showed responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides, how do we know any of these responses are real? Isn’t the whole idea of a control to give a baseline to compare to? There are several reasons to believe these results are legitimate: peptide assays are fairly robust in immunological studies; the amplitude and targets of the control response are distinct from the COVID-19-exposed response; and multiple studies from multiple labs found the same results with the same peculiarities. That said, the sample size is very small, and the lack of a non-reactive control should always be concerning, so more studies in this area should be conducted before we draw any strong conclusions here.)
</p>

<p>
COVID-19-exposed cells (top row) showed a robust response to a number of SARS-CoV-2 targets, but the unexposed controls also showed some responsiveness, especially among lesser-known viral peptides.
</p>
<h3>Reading the T leaves</h3>


<p>
Taken all together, these T cell experiments demonstrate that, well, T cells matter, too. A robust immune response requires many cells, and the evidence of consistent T cell activation in recovered patients indicates that T cells play an important role in the natural clearance of the virus. It stands to reason, then, that an effective vaccination strategy will likely have to consider how and when to activate T cells. These studies identify a number of distinct peptides that activate T cells across patients, and could therefore be used along with antibodies as part of a vaccination strategy.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

<p>Last time I have <a href="https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2020/08/02/post_juliacon_1.html">posted</a> about the take-aways for DataFrames.jl from
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. This time I wanted to share my general conclusions
from attending different talks at this extremely successful event.</p>

<p>I have spent 20 years now deploying data science related projects in corporate
environments (back then it was not called data science, but we were already
training neural networks to make predictions) and have many colleagues who are
deeply into enterprise software development. Quoting a discussion with
Tomasz Olczak I had some time ago, who is a genuine one-man army in
delivering complex enterprise projects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Julia is fast, and has a very nice syntax, but its ecosystem is not mature
enough for use in serious production projects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For many years I would agree with it, but after <a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>
I believe we can confidently announce that</p>

<p>
  <b><i>Julia is production ready!</i></b>
</p>

<p>Let me now give a list of key (in my opinion) presentations given during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a> that make me draw this conclusion.</p>

<p>I will not comment here on functionalities related to number crunching, as it
is clear that Julia shines here, but rather I want to focus on the things that
make Julia a great tool for deployment in production (still I skip many
interesting talks in this area — check out the detailed <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/agenda/">agenda</a> to
learn more).</p>



<p>In <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y3H7FG">this talk</a> <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn</a> gives an end to end tutorial how
to build and deploy in an enterprise setting a microservice using Julia.
He gives ready recipes how to solve typical tasks that need to be handled in
such contexts: logging, context management, middleware setup, authentication,
caching, connection pooling, dockerization, and many other, that
are bread and butter of enterprise projects.</p>

<p>As an addition be sure to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Z8TE39">shippable apps</a> talk, where <a href="https://github.com/KristofferC">Kristoffer Carlsson</a> guides you
through creating executables which can be run on machines that do not have Julia
installed.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/N39HSX">Julia for scripting</a> presentation, during which
<a href="https://github.com/fredrikekre">Fredrik Ekre</a> discusses the best practices for using Julia in contexts
where you need to execute short code snippets many times.</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DTLBM9">Genie.jl</a> talk, in which <a href="https://github.com/essenciary">Adrian Salceanu</a> shows that it is currently
a mature, stable, performant, and feature-rich Julia web development framework.</li>
</ul>



<p>The two talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PLFURQ">Pkg.update()</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/RXAN8F">What’s new in Pkg</a> show that
currently Julia has best in class functionalities for enterprise grade dependency
management for your projects. The list of provided functionalities is so long
that it is hard to list them all here.</p>

<p>Let me just mention one particular tool in this ecosystem, that is presented in
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/9WMAVU">BinaryBuilder.jl</a> talk that explains how to take software written in compiled
languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go or Rust, and build precompiled artifacts
that can be used from Julia packages with ease (which means that no compilation
has to take place on client side when you install packages having such dependencies).</p>



<p>A natural topic related to dependency management is how to integrate Julia with
external tools. This area of functionality is really mature. Here is a list of
talks that cover this topic:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/7MALUA">Make your Julia code faster and compatible with non-Julia code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/NNVQQF">Wrapping a C++ library using CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/XGHSWW">Julia and C++: a technical overview of CxxWrap.jl</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Y7ERM9">Introducing the @ccall macro</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/PHGCKB">Integrating Julia in R with the JuliaConnectoR</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/Q88P8U">Integrate Julia and Javascript using Node.js extensions</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here it is worth to add Julia has had a great integration with Python for many
years now, see <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy">JuliaPy</a>.</p>

<p>A good end to end example of doing some real work in Julia that requires integration
is <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/KK9S9V">Creating a multichannel wireless speaker setup with Julia</a>
talk that show how to easily stitch things together (and in particular featuring
ZMQ.jl, Opus.jl, PortAudio.jl, and DSP.jl).</p>

<p>Another interesting talk showcasing integration capabilities is
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/GFE3DB">JSServe: Websites &amp; Dashboards in Julia</a>
that shows a high performance framework to easily combine interactive plots,
markdown, widgets and plain HTML/Javascript in Jupyter / Atom / Nextjournal and
on websites.</p>



<p>The two great talks <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DWCJUK">Juno 1.0</a> and <a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HBTFT7">Using VS Code</a> that current IDE
support for Julia in VS Code is first class. You have all tools that normally you
would expect to get: code analysis (static and dynamic), debugger, workspaces,
integration with Jupyter Notebooks, and remote capabilities.</p>



<p>I do not want to cover many different ML algorithms that are available in Julia
natively, as there are just too many of them (and if something is missing you
can easily integrate it — see the integration capabilities section above).</p>

<p>However, on top of particular models you need frameworks that let you manage
ML workflows. In this area there are two interesting talks, one about
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/DMHZCC">MLJ: a machine learning toolbox for Julia</a> and the other showing
<a href="https://live.juliacon.org/talk/AD7TQW">AutoMLPipeline: A ToolBox for Building ML Pipelines</a>. From my experience
such tools are crucial when you want to move with your ML models from data scientist’s
sandbox to a real production usage.</p>



<p>Obviously, I have omitted many interesting things that were shown during
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/">JuliaCon 2020</a>. However, I hope that the aspects I have covered here,
that is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enterprise grade patterns to create microservices and applications in Julia,</li>
  <li>robust dependency management tools,</li>
  <li>very flexible and powerful capabilities to integrate Julia with existing code
bases that were not written in Julia,</li>
  <li>excellent developer tooling in VSCode,</li>
  <li>mature packages that help you to create production-grade code for ML solutions
deployment,</li>
</ul>

<p>show that already now Julia can (and should) be considered as a serious option
for your next project in enterprise environment.</p>

<p>What I believe is crucially important is that not only we have required tools
ready but also we have great practical showcases how they can be used to build
robust production code with.</p>

		<div>
		<p><span>Security is one of the most important aspects of software development. Gone are the days when companies focused on the amount of code developers produce. Nowadays, they care about the quality and security of your code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The increasing number of</span><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-in-2019/"> <span>security breaches over the past years</span></a><span> is alarming. Too often, we hear scary stories about how millions of people’s personal information and financial records were exposed following a data breach. With this trend, every developer should focus on building more secure systems.</span></p>

<p><span>In this article, I will put together a list of practices that, in my view, offer a solid foundation for building more secure applications. Having worked with hundreds of developers in multiple companies for the past few decades, I’ve had the privilege to interact and learn a great deal from various development professionals.</span></p>

<p><span>So, here are my ground rules for writing more secure code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><b>Secure By Design</b></h2>

<p><span>Writing</span><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.228.5794&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=70"> <span>clean and secure code</span></a><span> begins long before creating the first class or forming the first loop. When designing systems, I see some architects focusing more on the functional requirements but sidelining the security side of things. They tend to assume that access controls and other security measures will be implemented later in the development stage.</span></p>

<p><span>This is wrong. Instead, development teams should embrace the</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design"> <span>secure by design</span></a><span> concept during application development.</span></p>

<p><span>During the design stage, prepare a list of technical and regulatory security requirements for your project. Think of every component that will be used in application development, from the class-level language to API endpoint authorization.</span></p>

<p><span>Having security in mind right from project inception is the best way to eliminate weaknesses inherent in the architecture of a product. Furthermore, it becomes harder to implement security controls or address vulnerabilities as the system develops.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The most effective approach is enforcing security controls right from the design stage.</span></p>

<h2><b>Model Threats to Your Code</b></h2>

<p><span>Threat modeling is a cost-effective approach to implementing security in the application design phase. It involves identifying potential threats to software, analyzing their risks, and developing mitigations strategies to be implemented in the design, coding, and testing stages.</span></p>

<p><span>By modeling threats to your code, you can anticipate the kind of threats that may affect your application way before coding begins. For instance, if you deal with credit card numbers, personally identifiable information, or intellectual property, it will be easier to identify possible security risks and devise ways of protecting your application.</span></p>

<p><span>If you can imagine an attack on your code, you can keep the threat in mind when designing and implementing the system.</span></p>

<h2><b>Don’t Trust User Data</b></h2>

<p><span>If you look at the vast majority of software vulnerabilities, you will realize they share a common trait in that they stem from</span><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html"> <span>improper input validation</span></a><span>. Think of SQL injections, cross-site scripting, LDAP injections, xPath injections, buffer overflow, uncontrolled string format, and other common security gaps.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I’ll insist on this – always treat all input as untrusted until proven otherwise. Sometimes being skeptical pays. As long as the data is coming from an external source, there’s every reason to verify it.&nbsp; This should be done regardless of whether the input comes from environment variables, network interfaces, command line arguments, or user controlled files.</span></p>

<p><span>When developing a PHP application, for instance, you need to validate several elements. Here is an example class you can call to validate user input from your forms.</span></p>



	</div>
	</div>
</section><section id="b-text-2">
	<div>
		<div>
		<h2><span>the</span><span> Principle </span><span>o</span><span>f Least Privilege</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span>Some developers give users access to all features and permissions they might need to avoid restructuring their code in the future. This leaves a pathway that attackers can abuse upon getting their hands on your system.</span></p>

<p><span>A good practice is to limit privileges by giving each account the appropriate</span> <span>(least)</span><span> amount of privilege. Access within applications should be designed in a way that attackers are denied most functionalities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Ideally, base your access controls on permission as opposed to exclusion. In doing this, access is denied by default so that the protection scheme will determine the conditions under which access is granted.</span></p>


<h2><span>Sanitize Data Sent </span><span>to</span><span> Other Systems</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Data passed to an output subsystem may contain malicious content, especially if it originates from an untrusted source. If not escaped or sanitized properly, this data can be used to facilitate injection attacks. For this reason, output sanitization as vital as proper input validation to prevent attacks.</p>
<div>

<p><span>To prevent attackers from taking advantage of unused functionality in output data, always sanitize the data before invoking another system component. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The only code that can identify malicious characters is the code responsible for output in a given context. This is where you should add a contextual escaping functionality before displaying data to the user.</span></p>

<p><span>For instance, when building SQL, you can use parameterized query features to ensure proper escaping:</span></p>

</div>




<p><span>Below is a simple non-compliant code that uses the </span><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Java MVC concept</a></span><span> to display data to users without escaping or encoding it. The code below sends data to a web browser, which means it is subject to XSS and HTML injection attacks.</span></p>




	</div>
	</div>
</section><section id="b-text-3">
	<div>
		<div>
		<p><span>To fix this, I can create a ValidateOutput class that will normalize the output and sanitize it using a whitelist. Note that you can use a different whitelisting pattern depending on your output fields.</span></p>



<h2><b>Adopt Secure Coding Standards</b></h2>

<p><span>Every developer has been in at least one lecture about</span><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/How_to_write_insecure_code"> <span>secure coding practices</span></a><span>. It might get boring, but it’s important to safeguard your code.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Some secure coding standards you should follow at every stage of the application development process include:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Avoid using language functions and other components with known security vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Use proper encyprion techniques to protect user data.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid revealing internal implementation through error messages.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not implement your own authentication and authorization system. Instead, consider adding an extra security layer through 2-factor authentication.</span></li>
<li><span>Effective monitoring and logging of user activity.</span></li>
<li><span>Scan and analyze your codebase for dependency vulnerabilities.</span></li>
<li><span>Stay on top of security releases.</span></li>
<li><span>Perform quality assurance checks through rigorous testing and source code audits.</span></li>
<li><span>Integrate the right security tools in your IDE, source repository, bug tracking systems, and other environments used during development.</span></li>
<li><span>Make necessary security documentation.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Wrap Up</b></h2>

<p><span>Code security is the ultimate measure of code quality, and it’s not hard to achieve. I’ve seen most of my colleagues complicate stuff by overthinking secure designs. At the end, they have a strangely complex system that’s even harder to secure.</span></p>

<p><span>The best approach is keeping your designs as simple as you possible. This way, you can understand and prove the security of your system.</span></p>

<p><span>Embrace the above practices as you write your code. It’s a sure way of contributing to a safer world today.</span></p>

<p>Ever seen a Sprint board that’s a big bucket of completely unrelated tickets? For many teams, that describes pretty much all of them. I call them Mishmash Sprints. These teams have skipped over one of my favorite parts of Scrum: the Sprint Goal.</p>



<p>The Scrum Guide defines the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#:~:text=The%20Sprint%20Goal%20is%20an%20objective%20set%20for%20the%20Sprint%20that%20can%20be%20met%20through%20the%20implementation%20of%20Product%20Backlog.">Sprint Goal</a> as:</p>



<blockquote><p>The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It <strong>provides guidance</strong> to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal <strong>gives the Development Team some flexibility</strong> regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function, which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other coherence that causes the Development Team to <strong>work together rather than on separate initiatives</strong>.</p><cite>The Scrum Guide (emphasis mine)</cite></blockquote>



<p>It’s right there in core Scrum, but many so-called “Scrum Teams” ignore it. That’s a crying shame. The Sprint Goal is a game changer for those teams because it brings:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team cohesiveness</strong>. When everyone is working towards the same goal each sprint, there’s not nearly as much siloing. Teams jell faster. Work is more visible. The number of “only Susan knows how to do that” things goes down.</li><li><strong>Less work in progress</strong>. Mishmash Sprints lead to long cycle times for features. When the team works on 10 goals at once, it takes 10 times as long for the team to finish any of them. Remember that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Eliminate_waste">WIP is waste</a> and cut it out!</li><li><strong>An actual valuable iteration</strong>. When each Sprint completes a real goal, then you can be sure that you’re actually delivering value with each iteration. Mishmash Sprints often don’t deliver value until it all comes together at the end of the project. That’s not Agile, that’s Waterfall.</li><li><strong>Development Team ownership</strong>. “The Sprint Goal <em>gives the Development Team some flexibility</em> regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint”. With the Sprint Goal as the guiding light, the Development Team (consulting with the Product Owner) can decide how that goal should be achieved. Mishmash Sprints make it too easy for developers to be ticket takers and code monkeys.</li></ul>



<p>If you’re struggling to come up with a Sprint Goal, just ask yourself: if we only had one more sprint to work on this before launching, what would be the most important thing to do? There’s your Sprint Goal.</p>

<p>The M/M/c model may not behave like you expect.</p>


<p>I have a system with <code>c</code> servers, each of which can only handle a single concurrent request, and has no internal queuing. The servers sit behind a load balancer, which contains an infinite queue. An unlimited number of clients offer <code>c * 0.8</code> requests per second to the load balancer on average. In other words, we increase the offered load linearly with <code>c</code> to keep the per-server load constant. Once a request arrives at a server, it takes one second to process, on average. How does the client-observed mean request time vary with <code>c</code>?</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_plot.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Option A is that the mean latency decreases quickly, asymptotically approaching one second as <code>c</code> increases (in other words, the time spent in queue approaches zero). Option B is constant. Option C is a linear improvement, and D is a linear degradation in latency. Which curve do you, intuitively, think that the latency will follow?</p>

<p>I asked my Twitter followers the same question, and got an interestingly mixed result:
<img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_twitter_poll.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Breaking down the problem a bit will help figure out which is the right answer. First, names. In the terminology of queue theory, this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue">M/M/c</a> queuing system: Poisson arrival process, exponentially distributed client service time, and <code>c</code> backend servers. In teletraffic engineering, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agner_Krarup_Erlang">Erlang's</a> delay system (or, because terminology is fun, M/M/n). We can use a classic result of queuing theory to analyze this system: Erlang's C formula <em>E<sub>2,n</sub>(A)</em>, which calculates the probability that an incoming customer request is enqueued (rather than handled immediately), based on the number of servers (<code>n</code> aka <code>c</code>), and the offered traffic <code>A</code>. For the details, see page 194 of the <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/stg/D-STG-SG02.16.1-2001-PDF-E.pdf">Teletraffic Engineering Handbook</a>. Here's the basic shape of the curve (using our same parameters):</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/erlang_c_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Follow the blue line up to half the saturation point, at 2.5 rps offered load, and see how the probability is around 13%. Now look at the purple line at half its saturation point, at 5 rps. Just 3.6%. So at half load the 5-server system is handling 87% of traffic without queuing, with double the load and double the servers, we handle 96.4% without queuing. Which means only 3.6% see any additional latency.</p>

<p>It turns out this improvement is, indeed, asymptotically approaching 1. The right answer to the Twitter poll is A.</p>

<p>Using the mean to measure latency is controversial (although <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">perhaps it shouldn't be</a>). To avoid that controversy, we need to know whether the percentiles get better at the same rate. Doing that in closed form is somewhat complicated, but this system is super simple, so we can plot them out using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The results look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://mbrooker-blog-images.s3.amazonaws.com/sim_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>That's entirely good news. The median (p50) follows the mean line nicely, and the high percentiles (99<sup>th</sup> and 99.9<sup>th</sup>) have a similar shape. No hidden problems.</p>

<p>It's also good news for cloud and service economics. With larger <code>c</code> we get better latency at the same utilization, or better utilization for the same latency, all at the same per-server throughput. That's not good news only for giant services, because most of this goodness happens at relatively modest <code>c</code>. There are few problems related to scale and distributed systems that get easier as <code>c</code> increases. This is one of them.</p>

<p>There are some reasonable follow-up questions. Are the results robust to our arbitrary choice of 0.8? Yes, they are<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. Are the M/M/c assumptions of Poisson arrivals and exponential service time reasonable for typical services? I'd say they are reasonable, albeit wrong. Exponential service time is especially wrong: realistic services tend to be something more like log-normal. It may not matter. More on that another time.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Dan Ports responded to my thread with a fascinating <a href="https://twitter.com/danrkports/status/1291517540280070144">Twitter thread</a> pointing to <a href="https://drkp.net/papers/latency-socc14.pdf">Tales of the Tail: Hardware, OS, and Application-level Sources of Tail Latency</a> from SoCC'14 which looks at this effect in the wild.</p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> Up to a point. As soon as the mean arrival rate exceeds the system's ability to complete requests, the queue grows without bound and latency goes to infinity. In our case, that happens when the request load exceeds <code>c</code>. More generally, for this system to be stable <code>λ/cμ</code> must be less than 1, where <code>λ</code> is the mean arrival rate, and <code>μ</code> is the mean time taken for a server to process a request.</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

<p>HMACs and MACs are authentication codes and are often the backbone of JWT authentication systems. Let’s take a look at how they work.</p>



<h2>MAC – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code">Message Authentication Code</a></h2>



<p>MACs are exactly what they sound like; small codes that allow receivers of messages to know who the sender was (authentication). A MAC code is calculated by using a message and a secret key as inputs. Anyone who has a copy of that secret key can then verify that that code and message were created by someone with the same key.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png" alt="MAC diagram" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png 788w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-300x127.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-768x326.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-100x42.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" data-srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png 788w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-300x127.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-768x326.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM-100x42.png 100w" data-src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-12-at-7.49.24-AM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure></div>



<p>One way this is accomplished is by using a <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function,</a> for instance, <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-256</a>. Simply put, a hash function takes an input and then returns an output, where:</p>



<ul><li>The output is very unlikely to be the same for different inputs</li><li>The output is always the same for the same inputs</li><li>The output is not predictable – changing the input even slightly results in a seemingly random and large change to the output</li></ul>



<p>Given this, a naive example of MAC generation by the sender could be:</p>



<pre><code>message = 'my message here'
macCode = sha256('thisIsASecretKey1234' + message)
// send macCode and message</code></pre>



<p>Then the verification by the receiver would be:</p>



<pre><code>// receive macCode and message
if (macCode == sha256('thisIsASecretKey1234' + message)){
  // verified!
}</code></pre>



<p>Note that MACs don’t <em>necessarily</em> need to use a hash function, but a hash <em>can</em> be used as the “signing” mechanism.</p>



<h2>HMAC – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">Hash-Based Message Authentication Code</a></h2>



<p>An HMAC is a kind of MAC. All HMACs are MACs but not all MACs are HMACs. The main difference is that an HMAC uses two rounds of hashing instead of one (or none). Each round of hashing uses a section of the secret key. As a naive example:</p>



<pre><code>sha256('thisIsASe' + sha256('cretKey1234' + 'my message here'))</code></pre>



<p>Which is a simplified version of the function given in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104">RFC-2104</a>.</p>



<p>Why use HMAC? Why do we need to hash twice?</p>



<p>With many hash functions, it is possible to change the message (without knowing the key) and obtain another valid MAC. We call this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack">length extension attack</a>. No known extension attacks are known against the current HMAC specification.</p>



<h2 id="hmacs-with-jwts">HMACs with JWTs</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token">JWTs</a> for authentication schemes within a web app, then you know that JWTs are wonderful for keeping track of who is who. A JWT (when using HMAC as the signing scheme) is basically just an HMAC message where the message data is a JSON object.</p>



<p>The interesting thing about the JWT system is that the sender and the receiver of the JWT are typically the same entity, that is, the webserver. Look at the following example:</p>



<ul><li>User gives the server an username and password</li><li>Server verifies the username and password are correct</li><li>Server generates a JWT using HMAC:</li></ul>



<pre><code>hmacCode = sha256('thisIsASe' + sha256('cretKey1234' + '{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}'))</code></pre>



<ul><li>The server responds with the following (decoded) JWT:</li></ul>



<pre><code lang="javascript">header.{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}.hmacCode</code></pre>



<ul><li>User decides to update his/her profile picture by sending the following request:</li></ul>



<pre><code>PUT /users/profile_picture
Authentication: Bearer header.{"email":"lane@qvault.io"}.hmacCode

{"new_picture": "http://linktopicture.com/mypic"}</code></pre>



<ul><li>The server parses the JWT. The JWT says the user is <em>“lane@qvault.io”</em></li><li>The server verifies that the user really is Lane by validating the HMAC code. Only someone with access to the secret key <em>‘thisIsASecretKey1234’ </em>could have made the HMAC code that corresponds to the ‘lane@qvault.io’ message</li><li>If verification is successful, then the server updates Lane’s profile picture</li></ul>

<p><em>“At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $288. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588.”</em></p>



<p>As talks of TikTok’s ban or potential acquisition picks up steam, Microsoft is navigating rocky waters in an attempt to extrude some kind of deal amid the crossfire between Beijing and Washington – not to mention the multitude of big tech forces shaping the narrative. Whether the deal takes place, for what price and for how much of TikTok’s operations will have a resounding impact on the competition between Instagram, Facebook, Microsoft and even Amazon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s break down speculation around the deal first:</p>



<p><strong>Price:</strong> The estimated value of the US arm is currently ranging between $20-50 billion. The exact amount depends on a plethora of factors and several discordant stakeholders coming to consensus. The best speculative guess we can make has to be grounded in as much context as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Bytedance valuation:</strong> Bytedance, TikTok’s parent company has a private-market valuation of more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-20/tiktok-owner-s-value-surpasses-100-billion-in-private-markets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 billion</a>, reaching up to $140 billion based on a small private sale made by early stakeholder Cheetah Mobile. Some analysts have predicted that Bytedance could IPO at a valuation north of this, going up as far as $180 billion.</p>



<p><strong>TikTok share of Bytedance:</strong> Bytedance revenue in 2019 was estimated to be around $17 billion, of this TikTok (including DouYin) revenue made up about $179.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TikTok projected revenue 2020:</strong> $1 billion, 315 million downloads globally in Q1 (TikTok and DouYin)</p>



<p><strong>Tiktok projected revenue 2021</strong>: TikTok expects to bring in $6 billion in revenue in 2021 according to TikTok management but outsiders have expressed that this is an aggressive estimate, putting a more reasonable range at around $4 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>American Share of TikTok: </strong>Of the 2019 revenue China’s DouYin arm accounted for $122.9 million (69%) while the American market accounted for about $36 million (20%). In April of 2020 in-app purchases on the app increased ten-fold to $78 million where the Chinese market accounted for 86.6% followed by an 8.2% contribution from the American market. At the moment it is predicted that there are about 85 million monthly active TikTok users in the U.S.</p>



<p>There have been reports of investors valuing TikTok around $50 billion in the takeover bid, this is approximately 50 times its projected revenue for 2020. Many publications have compared this to SnapChat’s market capitalization which sits around $33 billion at the moment (15 times its 2020 projected revenue). While Snapchat exists within the same social media ecosystem the comparison has to account for two factors.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s position in the growth cycle</li><li>TikTok vs Snapchat’s core proposition&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Snapchat is vastly different on both fronts. For this reason, it’s difficult to gauge whether the current 50x pricing model is absurd or not in relative terms. A reference point, despite being more distant, that I find more revealing is the 2012 Facebook acquisition of Instagram for $1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time Instagram represented an up and coming giant in the social media landscape (which in and of itself was quite new) and was doing for photo sharing what TikTok has been doing for short video content (at least, doing more effectively than any of its predecessors). Facebook acquired Instagram at an average price of about $30 per user, when its own platform was valued at about $100 per user. Given that social media in 2012 represented a far less developed market and the almost ten year lead time, it’s difficult to directly compare Instagram to TikTok. Today Instagram is valued at over $100 billion and has over 1 billion users, placing its per user rate at $100. At a market cap of $755 billion (at point of writing) Facebook’s per user value is around $290. If Facebook is some leading indicator for the pinnacle of per user value for social media, then at $50 billion for the roughly 85 million American users, TikTok’s per user value would be $588 (this doesn’t change significantly when accounting for the Australian/Canadia/NZ markets given low penetration).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>Where Instagram made up less than a third of Facebooks per user value at the point of acquisition, TikTok is hovering around double or more and more than 5x Instagrams current per user value. Of course, Instagram had no revenue generation and far few users (33 million) in 2012 while TikTok’s rapid growth has made it a giant in its own right. What we’re then looking at, assuming a $50 billion valuation is a complete market disruptor. Even at a $30 billion takeover bid, Microsoft would be paying $352 per user. </p>



<p>Microsoft isn’t negotiating a price range between $20-50 billion based on revenue projections of which a majority are derivative of the Chinese Douyin market, they are at the table on the basis of becoming potentially larger than the largest social media platform in the world. Rather than how this valuation pans out for investors, the longer-lasting and more pertinent question is how does this change the entire social media landscape and Microsoft’s role in the next decade. With such weighty questions up in the air, a 50x pricing model of revenue projection doesn’t seem so absurd – rather a significant turning point in the decade’s narrative around big tech.</p>

<h3>I made a mechanical keyboard with 3d-printed switches</h3>
<p><i>Fri  7 August 2020</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/3dprinting.html">3dprinting</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">keyboard</a></i></p>
<p>The keyboard is done! This is basically the result of what I've been working on for the past 2 months, which has
involved 3 iterations of testing machines, over 100 printed switches, and now finally a keyboard that I can type on.
Unfortunately it is not a very good keyboard, but you can't win them all.</p>
<p>Here's some pictures of the keyboard:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2843"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2844"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2845"></a></p>
<p>And here's a video of me typing on it:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iEBbCk1WJUk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>(In the video it is a bit wobbly because the back is propped up to take the pressure off the exposed wiring. I have subsequently printed a couple of small legs to raise up
the back of the keyboard and now it is a lot <i>less</i> wobbly, but it could still do with some soft feet).</p>
<p>I am very happy with how the keyboard looks, and also happy that I have managed to produce a working keyboard using 3d-printed switches in the first place. I believe
this may be a world first.</p>
<p>That said, I started using the jesboard to write this blog post, and it was too annoying to type on so I went back to the Filco. Spending some time typing
on my homemade switches has given me a newfound appreciation for just how good Cherry MX switches are. I'm not sure what it is that makes the
jesboard so unpleasant to type on, there's just a general vagueness to it that makes typing frustrating. Pressing a single key up and down feels basically fine, which is why I hadn't
noticed this problem while developing the switches. But trying to use it as an actual keyboard, and type at a sensible speed, just feels <i>really</i> bad. It
is genuinely the worst keyboard I have ever used. So that's disappointing.</p>
<p>I think to improve upon this you'd probably want to reduce the activation force (that's easy, just make the spring thinner) and add some tactile feedback so it is easier to tell
when the switch has actually been pressed. Beyond that, I'm not sure.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2841"></a></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the switches, I would recommend looking at some of my other <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/keyboard.html">posts tagged "keyboard"</a>, but in short:
pressing on the stem at the top compresses the spiral spring (I copied the spring design from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSsm4h2ccJMdR6bsAFyIu6A">Riskable 3D Printing</a>, he
is also developing 3d-printable keyboard switches, but using magnet sensors instead of making mechanical switches himself). Once
the stem is pressed down far enough, a contact wire bridges the 2 contacts at the bottom, activating the switch. As the switch is pressed further, the leaf spring compresses, allowing
the stem to move further down while allowing the contact wire to remain in place. Eventually the spiral spring bottoms out against its casing and then stem movement stops. When the key is released,
the spiral spring pushes everything back up to the top.</p>
<p>The leaf spring has a section in its bend that is narrow in the "other" axis, to allow it easily tilt side-to-side to ensure good contact with both of the contact wires.</p>
<p>I don't have a good photo of the latest switch design, but I have this of an earlier version:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2757"></a></p>
<p>The working principle is the same but the new version is a bit shorter.</p>
<p>The switches are printed in PETG. If you want to see them in action, you might enjoy my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRBQBf6jzFM">video of operating the switch tester</a>.
The final incarnation of the switch design lasted over 350k presses in all cases, and some instances still hadn't failed at 500k presses. This is a lot lower than the "tens of millions" that might be
expected of a commercial switch, but it's a big improvement over <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/keyswitch-failure.html">13907</a> which is where the first iteration failed, and that was on an extremely
gentle machine.</p>
<p>I said I was going to experiment with moving the activation point down to 75% of the plunger travel so as to reduce the strain on
the leaf spring. I did test this on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/another-new-tester.html">new machine</a>, with 5 of the old design and 5 of the new design side-by-side, and the new design lasted almost
twice as long, so that was a good improvement.</p>
<p>The gold-plated "jewellery wire" that I bought off eBay ended up working well and soldering well (so I conclude it was not varnished),
and 4 metres (costing £4) was <i>just</i> enough to do the entire keyboard.</p>
<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/3dpswitch.tar.gz">download the switch CAD</a>, including STL and FreeCAD files.</p>
<h2>Case</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2805"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2804"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2832"></a></p>
<p>The case is split into 2 halves that are then glued together, so that it fits on the bed of the 3D printer. There is a large rectangular hole at the top and bottom in each half, and a long bit of plastic
inside joining them, to add a bit more strength to the joint. There's not a lot to the case design really, it is just a shape to fit the switches into,
with a bulge at the top to house the microcontroller, an exit hole for the cable, stabiliser mounts, and a cool-looking logo. I made the general shape of the case halves in FreeCAD, and then imported the resulting STL
into OpenSCAD to cut out the holes for the switches, because I found it easier to get the layout correct with code.</p>
<p>I printed the logo in a different colour by having the printer stop and wait for me to change the filament at the layer height where the colour changes, using the
<a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M600.html">M600</a> G-code command. PrusaSlicer has a nice GUI for setting this up, so I didn't even need to manually edit the G-code.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2846"></a></p>
<p>If I were to make another keyboard, I would give myself more space to work with underneath by reducing the thickness of the "solid" middle part that the switches are mounted in.
I found that there was not really enough room to run the diodes and wires. I would also add provision for a few screws to attach a bottom cover to protect the wiring inside.</p>
<p>The case and keycaps are printed in Prusament Galaxy Black PLA, which I think gives a really nice finish.</p>
<h2>Keycaps</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2848"></a></p>
<p>The keycaps were designed using <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2">KeyV2</a>, a free parametric keycap library for OpenSCAD. If you want to design
some keycaps, you should check out KeyV2. Its creator, <a href="https://github.com/rsheldiii">Bob</a>, is friendly and gave me helpful advice and assistance.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to make an ISO (UK-style) enter key in KeyV2, but I couldn't find any combination of settings that would let me have rounded corners, sloping top,
and dished top, so I ended up making the enter key by hand in FreeCAD.</p>
<p>I was originally going to use "outset" legends on the keycaps, like I used on the <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/3pct-keyboard.html">macro keypad</a>. But I read this comment in the KeyV2 source
which changed my mind, so I used inset legends instead:</p>
<pre><code>// make legends outset instead of inset.
// broken off from artisan support since who wants outset legends?
$outset_legends = false;</code></pre>
<p>But having printed all the keycaps, I'm not sure whether I think inset legends actually <i>are</i> better. They range from "perfectly fine" to "almost invisible" depending on the lighting. I'd
say the outset legends were easier to read.</p>
<h2>Wiring</h2>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2836"></a></p>
<p>The switches are hand-wired in a 15x5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_matrix_circuit">keyboard matrix</a>, with diodes allowing current to pass only in one direction. 14x5 would be enough
if you thought about it a bit more than I did, but 15x5 is fine.</p>
<p>Originally I was planning to use an Arduino for the microcontroller, which has only 16 IO pins. This would allow for an 8x8 matrix, but when I went to layout the wiring, I came up with this, where
red is columns and green is rows:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2824"></a></p>
<p>Obviously this is too complicated to wire up in real life, particularly in the small amount of space provided in the bottom of my case. You may also notice it was too complicated for me to
lay out in GIMP, as I have failed to connect the full-stop and apostophe keys to any row. For these reasons I decided to use a <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> 2.0 instead, which allowed me to use a more sensible matrix layout:</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2835"></a></p>
<p>(I laid this out on <a href="https://kbfirmware.com/">kbfirmware.com</a>).</p>
<p>The other part of the wiring is that the USB cable has to reach the microcontroller. I left a 4mm hole in the side of the case for the cable to run through, but this is too small for the connector
on the end. I was originally planning to cut the connector off and solder the wires directly to the USB pads on the micocontroller board, but they were too small and annoying to access, so instead
I just soldered the MiniUSB end back on and plugged it in. It's a tight fit but it does the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2847"></a></p>
<p>In hindsight, I am not sure whether I regret hand-wiring the keyboard. I toyed with the idea of getting a PCB made up that I could directly solder my switches to. It would certainly have
made it easier to put the keyboard together, but I thought outsourcing the manufacturing of a PCB kind of takes the edge off making your own switches...</p>
<h2>Stabilisers</h2>
<p>Here's a clip showing how the stabilisers work:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTvDP3Qutwk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The idea is that when you press down on one side you cause the bar to rotate, which then pulls down on the other side of the switch, forcing the key to move down parallel (instead of rocking)
and activate the switch properly. The bar is made of 1.75mm stainless steel wire bent into a suitable shape. Thick stainless wire is quite hard to cut, but doable with a big-ish pair of nippers.</p>
<p>While trying to fit the stabilisers for the spacebar, I managed to break off the mounts attached to the case. This is bad news because the case halves are about a 10-hour print each, and aside from
that I had already soldered up all of the switches. To reprint the case halves would involve undoing all of my soldering work, and then 20 hours of printing, and then redoing all of the soldering.</p>
<p>I wasn't interested in redoing all of that work, so as a last resort I drilled a hole into the case in the position of each stabiliser mount, and printed 2 new stabiliser mounts, long enough to fit
in the holes. I printed the mounts in PETG so that they'd be less likely to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"><img src="https://img.incoherency.co.uk/2842"></a></p>
<p>This worked really well, disaster averted! The mounts were a tight fit in the drilled holes so I didn't even need to use any glue.</p>
<h2>QMK</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> for the keyboard firmware, running on a Teensy 2.0. I found it quite hard to get started with my custom keyboard, because almost all of the documentation
is geared towards the case where you are using an off-the-shelf keyboard which is already defined in QMK. The key point I needed to know was that you can use the script "<tt>./util/new_keyboard.s…</tt></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you deploy your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster&nbsp;you can select the scaling options. Moreover, you can also set up <strong>continuous delivery</strong> for your microservice.</p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

<p>If you want to chose Data Science or Bioinformatics as a career, fetching,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bhagesh-codebeast.github.io/Data_Cyclopes/">cleaning  &amp; organizing the data </a> in a specific shape will be your day to day task before applying any analysis technique or machine learning algorithms. Here in this post, I'll be sharing few quick and basic pandas codes which will help you get your data in shape.</p>
<p>Pandas library in python is built on <em>NumPy</em>; It is a fundamental library in python for data analysis, pre-processing , e.t.c. it is rich in methods used for data munging &amp; a quick <strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong> (EDA). There are two main objects in pandas, they are pandas <strong>Series</strong> &amp; <strong>DataFrame</strong>.</p>
<p>You can see it as a database whose primary purpose is not for storing data, but easily manipulate and query data, which are features of every database management system.</p>
<p>The pandas spells covered in this article are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Importing Pandas</li>
<li>Reading Datasets from files</li>
<li>Exporting Data</li>
<li>Create test objects</li>
<li>Viewing/Inspecting Data</li>
<li>Selection / Filtering a specific data</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bhagesh-codebeast.github.io/Data_Cyclopes/">Data Cleaning / Wrangling</a> </li>
<li>Filter, Sort &amp; Groupby</li>
<li>Join &amp; Combine</li>
<li>Statistics</li>

<h2 id="5-viewing-inspecting-data">5. Viewing/Inspecting Data</h2>
<hr>
<p>Use these commands to take a look at specific sections of your pandas DataFrame or Series instead of scrolling all the way top just to look at your data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule of thumb: Don't be shy </p>

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>First element of first column<pre><code><span>df</span><span>.iloc</span><span>[0,0]</span>
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>An easy way to remember how  <code>loc</code>  &amp; <code>iloc</code> work is that  <code>i</code>  in  <code>iloc</code>  stands for <strong><em>integer</em></strong> i.e.  <code>iloc</code>  takes in integers as row &amp; column values while <code>loc</code> accepts row number  &amp; column names.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Have you ever saw a recruiter in your company chat going like:</p>

<blockquote><strong>@here</strong> does anybody have the
experience with Language X to review the challenge of a candidate?</blockquote>

<p>It is not hard to see it for what it is. It is a cry for help.</p>

<p>What recruiters are looking for is a hiring decision, and they need an engineer
to do it for them.</p>



<p>If everything goes well, one of your engineers will speak up and will accept the
task of reviewing this code.</p>

<p>The process may look something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Recruiter forwards an email with an attached archive containing the
solution.</li>
<li>The engineer receives and cracks it open to try to figure out what it is.</li>
<li>They may have to install missing software on their laptops to open the
challenge files. For example, you work in Ruby, but the challenge is in
Java.</li>
<li>Once opened, they will then check if there are any tests that they can run.</li>
<li>If there are tests, they will read them first to check what exactly the
candidate is testing. And whether the tests are reasonable and sensible in
the first place.</li>
<li>The engineer may run those tests, and they may or may not work. That may get
the engineer into fixing mood. Are tests broken or incorrect? Or are they
failing because of a different environment? In both cases, a couple of hours
will pass by.</li>
<li>The engineer will not be able to perform a correctness check. Not unless
they created the testing infrastructure for this challenge in advance.
Reading source code is not enough to verify it is correct. Thus, they will only
check that there are no grave errors. And that it follows the corporate style
and personal preferences. After all, that is what they do on every pull
request.</li>
<li>After a couple of hours of reading, the engineer may get a perception of the
code quality. Unfortunately, they still have no proof if it will work in
production, or not. Even after all this time and effort invested.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yet, the engineer will need to make a hiring decision to move on with their
day, or whatever of it remains.</p>

<h2 id="the-decision-costs">The decision costs</h2>

<p>You do not want the review to be superficial—or worse, a coin
toss—when hiring someone.  You want to get the most signal out of it to
get the best possible decision. Credible review of the code written by other
people requires skill and experience. The engineers that can do that are
usually the most tenured ones of your team (and likely the ones earning the
most). Reviewing the solutions will consume the time of your most seasoned
veterans. The very same engineers you rely on to build your product.</p>

<p>They will have to stop what they are doing and likely spend their whole day
doing the submission review.</p>

<p>People are generally decent, and they will try to be fair. If the code they are
reviewing has no tests, what will they do? They will try their best to see if a
tainted first impression still hides a good developer beneath it. They will try
to get the best out of the candidate solution. The better they do, the more
time it will consume.</p>

<p>The worst-case scenario is that this goodwill—or high pressure to hire
someone—will translate into a bad hire. And it will bring all the added
costs of it spreading through the company and impacting your teams.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-worry">Should you worry</h2>

<p>If you look closely and honestly, you can see that most of what your engineers
are doing is toil.  Repeated work which brings little to no value. Highly
inefficient use of your engineering time.</p>

<p>We ran hundreds of such classic interviewing loops. What we have discovered is
that reviewing about 40% of the code challenges sent by candidates is a waste
of time. Some were incomplete, and others did not fit the description of the
problem. Sometimes they were simply a complete trainwreck.</p>

<p>Another 20% will not pass a thoughtful review process. And only the remaining
40% will be the pool out of which you can hire. Not to mention that
distribution, naturally, will be heavily skewed towards junior-level developers.
Less than 10% of your original pool of applicants will be senior-level people
and above.</p>

<p>Around 60% of the submissions will yank your people away from their tasks only
to end up in a direct rejection. They will impact your product development
without any return on investment. Do this often enough, and your whole
development pipeline will grind to a halt.</p>

<p>(Note: we processed about six hundred candidates when we calculated those
percentages.)</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>

<p>If you repeat, again and again, things that leave you off in a worse place than
before—stop doing them!</p>

<blockquote><pre>           __
          /  \        _____________
          |  |       /             \
          @  @       | Stop making |
          || ||      | bad hiring  |
          || ||   &lt;--| decisions!  |
          |\_/|      \_____________/
          \___/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Only then can you move forward. Counterintuitively, the path forward is not
complicated or obscure as it could seem. What you need to do is improve your
filtering.</p>

<p>Stop burning time in candidates that have zero chance to go through. Here we
are talking about the initial 60% of the challenges you get back. Every hour
invested here is a wasted hour. Your senior people should focus on building and
maintaining your product instead. On a side note, you are also saving them from
the frustration of reviewing the lousy solutions. After all, the happier they
are, the better your company is.</p>

<p>Define a set of rules and metrics that you expect from a solution. Then,
communicate them to the candidates in all fairness. No unit tests are a no-go?
So be it, but let the candidate know it in advance, so the expectations are
clear. That not only makes it a fair game but also provides you with the tools
to apply those rules.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-did-and-what-worked-for-us">What we did, and what worked for us</h2>

<p>We applied a simple rule for our challenges: it has to work in production.</p>

<p>Immediate improvement was that we did not have to spend any time on the 60% of
solutions that were not working. Some candidates did not reply, and others did
not consider the test to be engaging or even fair. Some still insisted on the
interview, while being unable to ship something that works. We freed our
engineers from reviewing all those submissions.</p>

<p>That alone resulted in more than a 2x decrease in time spent on reviews. We
returned hundreds of hours of engineering time to the company by removing all
this toil. And on top of that, we removed all the not-fun work only!</p>

<p>For us, it resulted in happier engineers across the company. For candidates, it
improved transparency. They now understood what to expect upfront and how well
they are doing during the challenge. Overall, that increased our interview to
offer rate by roughly 50%.</p>

<h2 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h2>

<p>This simple change yielded fantastic results for us. So we have built it as a
product to help all the companies that want to hire smartly.  Engineering time
is an invaluable resource, so start saving it with
<a href="https://ais.autoiterative.com/demo">AutoIterative</a>. Reinvest it back into your
company and focus on your product, while we do the filtering for you.  Then you
can focus on interviewing the people who can deliver and meet the bar that you
set.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Not too long ago, a friend and new contributor to a large codebase I work with was surprised to learn that an automatic linter rule will block the merge of any pull request containing the string FIXME. “This rule is ill-considered”, he cried out, exasperated.</p>
<p>Judging from his reaction, I didn’t do a good job of explaining the rationale behind our rule. Our use of FIXMEs is unorthodox, but we decided to adopt it for a reason. In fact, in my opinion treating FIXMEs as merge blockers is among the most effective techniques for reducing cognitive overload. In this post, I will explain how FIXMEs unclutter the mind. My goal is to show that automatically enforced FIXMEs are an effective tool for teams working on hard problems.</p>

<p>Code comments are as old as programming itself. Codetags are also not a recent innovation. In the 1980s, programmers started attaching special significance to short tags like FIXME or TODO.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Tags were added as a heads-up that the author wasn’t entirely satisfied with a solution, both as a <em>note to self</em> and for the benefit of other readers. The use of uppercase letters not only made tags stand out visually, it also makes it easy to grep for them.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Codetags are in wide use today, though semantics vary from team to team. While often initially vague, over time more specific meanings tend to materialize, much like emojis in Slack communities gradually acquire a more definite meaning. In my team, a clear line separates FIXMEs from TODOs. The distinction between the two is not universal - it’s an arbitrary convention, but a very useful one. A TODO annotation means that the code in question could be optimized or cleaned up. Crucially, however, delaying the suggested improvement is acceptable, perhaps even preferable from a project-management perspective. A TODO is a gentle nudge. FIXMEs, on the other hand, signal that the code isn’t ready to merge until the author addresses the problem. Our automated linter adds reality to this stringent judgment: FIXMEs fail the CI build, while TODOs are given a pass.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Tags with an agreed-upon meaning aid communication between team members while the pull request is in progress. “FIXME or TODO?” you might ask your colleague while pairing, requesting clarification of the status and priority of a less-than-satisfying solution. Similarly, during code review a FIXME left in the code signals that the line annotated requires close attention. It’s a cry for help: “I’m stuck! Can we talk about this?”</p>
<p>While there are valid use cases for TODOs (more on that below), it is FIXMEs that are the more powerful of the two. In particular, FIXMEs have an important role to play before code is ready to review, which is the aspect I will focus on in this post. When encountering a stumbling block — a thought that will lead you away from your path — what you can do is to introduce a FIXME comment:</p>
<pre><code>// FIXME: hardcoded user-id

// FIXME: O(n2) time complexity, check if fast enough</code></pre>
<p>Some FIXMEs concern small detours, like retrieving a user-id from inside an existing function. Other issues are more substantial and will require serious thought to resolve. Either way fixing the issue demands mental bandwidth, which is in short supply. While it’s tempting to jump into the FIXME right away, the best choice is often to leave it to one side for the moment.</p>
<h2 id="two-examples-of-using-fixmes">Two examples of using FIXMEs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at two specific maneuvers made possible by FIXMEs. The first, <em>hardcoding</em>, is a form of wishful thinking. When the structure of the code makes it awkward to use a value, a refactoring safari is often needed. The maneuver is to delay this step. Wishful thinking begins with the what-if question. What if we had access to the id here? Well, let’s just pretend that we already do by hardcoding the value. This won’t work except in a very specific case, of course, so it’s not a generic solution — quite the opposite. But hardcoding an absurdly specific solution will allow you to make progress on the design while bracketing insignificant details. The generic solution will come later.</p>
<p><em>Stubbing</em>, the second maneuver, helps when multiple cases need to be considered. You start with a stub, replacing the missing case with an active FIXME:</p>
<pre><code>switch (v) {
   case 1:
   // do something
   break;
   case 2:
   // do something
   break;
   default:
   throw new Error("FIXME: Not implemented");
}</code></pre>
<p>With the partial implementation in place, can now experiment with and get a feel for the code. When you hit the missing case, it will fail loudly and clearly, with an exception and a stacktrace. But the FIXME is not only active at runtime. It will also ensure that you won’t forget to fill in the missing case before finishing your branch.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="juggling-concepts-and-virtual-memory">Juggling concepts and virtual memory</h2>
<p>Pausing a train of thought by converting it into a FIXME improves the flow of deep work, and we can see why by remembering that so many of us struggle to manage our daily priorities. As unfinished work piles up, we develop a nagging doubt in the back of our minds, a fear that there’s something important we’re forgetting, with all the bad consequences that entails. As a solution, David Allen’s Getting Things Done famously proposes a system of lists and weekly review sessions.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Lists work because writing a task into a notebook permits you to forget about it temporarily. Keeping a written list of <em>IN</em> tasks helps you relax about your obligations, so that instead of incessantly worrying about things falling through the cracks, you can be confident that the task is stashed away in a secure place. You know you’ll return to the tasks in your review session, which has a pre-scheduled spot in your calendar.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this idea to coding. FIXMEs are powerful because programming is a cognitively demanding activity. There are limits to how many concepts we can grasp at any given time. In juggling, the number of balls an average person can keep in the air is three.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> How many ideas can a person actively keep in their head at the same time? Perhaps more than three, but by most counts the number of ideas we can juggle is depressingly low. To switch metaphors, the programmer’s RAM or working memory is a scarce resource. Sure, there’s a spectrum here – some people can retain more data in memory than others. But if not careful, even the best programmer quickly runs out of heap.</p>
<p>We can push the analogy even further. Think of how effective pair programming is when working through a hard problem. The Linux virtual memory system allows the user to double their RAM by making use of spare hard drive capacity. Similarly, the pairing partner temporarily expands the programmer’s working memory by allowing them access to part of their cognitive capacity. Writing down FIXMEs achieves a similar effect. Whereas in a pairing session you extend your cognitive capacity with help from your partner, FIXMEs allow you to swap to disk. You remove an idea from your working memory, with the intention of paging it back in as needed, usually at the end of the session.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="focus-on-the-inherent-complexity">Focus on the inherent complexity</h2>
<p>The net effect of temporarily transferring inessential questions to swap space is improved focus on the inherent complexity of the problem, the solution to which is the ultimate goal. Accidental complexity has a talismanic quality. We have an unfortunate but understandable tendency to get distracted by mere details of how to express an idea in code. It is true that eventually we will need a decision about the accidental aspects of the problem, but as a rule it is better to tackle the essential complexity first. The rest is FIXMEs.</p>
<p>Your brain is prone to worrying that you may after all forget about the hardcoded value left in the code or the quadratic complexity that might blow up in production. People will be angry at you, or, what may be worse, you’ll blame yourself. Whether we like it or not, emotions and other sub-conscious processes play a big role in our ability to focus. The unconscious mind will not allow itself to stop worrying about a task unless it is written down, with a system in place ensuring you will circle back to the topic without risking emotional backlash. Writing down FIXMEs has a liberating effect. With CI as a safety net, the brain can relax.</p>
<h2 id="three-ways-of-eliminating-fixmes">Three ways of eliminating FIXMEs</h2>
<p>After moving the distraction out of the way, you can focus on the core problem. When your RAM isn’t cluttered with inessential details, the clearer view gives you a better shot at seeing the solution. At some point, of course, you will need to go back to the problem you snoozed. Having reached this point, eliminating the FIXME can take one of three possible forms.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Perhaps surprisingly, you may be able to simply delete the FIXME at this point. Sometimes things fall into place. In the process of implementing the main logic, you often end up solving the incidental issue as a consequence of the approach chosen, perhaps without even realizing it. Additionally, addressing the essential complexity puts you in a better position to understand the original incidental problem. Equipped with this knowledge, you may realize there’s nothing left to fix. Perhaps in practice n is always 3, so O(n2) complexity is perfectly fine. Or you recognize that, with the confidence gained from completing an implementation, your worry was about something that wasn’t worth worrying about in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible resolution is to face the problem head-on by performing the task you anticipated initially, for instance refactoring the code to get access to the user-id you needed or rewriting the algorithm to require O(n) iterations instead of O(n2). Frequently, a test case needs to be added as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally you can choose to downgrade the FIXME to TODO status. A TODO can remind you that the concern should be addressed at some point in the future. Often, filing a follow-up issue in your bug tracker will help make sure that the matter is not forgotten.<a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Filing a follow-up is not always what we would prefer, but it’s a valuable tool, especially when …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div>

<p>If you would like to follow along with the latest design or would like to dive deep into the internals of <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> we have created a repository on <a href="https://github.com/PopcornComputer/PocketPC-Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> for the latest hardware files. The work is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 United States License</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>We are one step closer to shipping Pocket P.C. with the latest developments.</strong></h3>



<p>The latest D.V.T PCB design is out for production. We expect the PCBs to arrive within 10-12 days.&nbsp; After that, we will be assembling 25 units.</p>



<p>The D.V.T. design brings with it a newly added SPI Flash which will allow <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>to more easily boot multiple operating systems on the same <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> We also changed the design to a 10-layer PCB stackup vs. 8-layers which will ensure better signal integrity for high-speed signals.</p>



<p>The keyboard layout has been tweaked incorporating feedback from community suggestions and from hands-on the 3D printed prototypes. Thank you to everyone who submitted feedback about our initial layout. The space bar has been extended to allow for it to be pressed from a comfortable hand position and a few other minor changes. You can view the latest layout in our community keyboard thread here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/pocket-p-c-keyboard-layout-part-2/541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. Keyboard Layout (Part 2)</a></p>



<p>We learned a lot from the last production run of Original Popcorn. We did not receive the level of support that we were promised from the USB-C IC manufacturer that we chose to handle the USB Power Delivery system. As such, we changed the <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C.</a> design to incorporate a robust Texas Instruments single-chip solution. With this new solution, we added to the design dedicated port protector ICs with ESD protection and surge protection ICs also from Texas Instruments on every ports. This will make the design more robust to faulty power conditions.</p>



<p>Finally, to ensure that <a href="https://pocket.popcorncomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket P.C. </a>has great software support out of the box, we have requested embedded development help from the community. Our goal is to ensure that we get all aspects of our products mainlined so that custom kernels will not be required. In order to accomplish this, a community effort is required to review and test new solutions before submitting them to the Linux Kernel mailing list. If you are interested in following with our development efforts you can join the discussion here: <a href="https://community.popcorncomputer.com/t/embedded-linux-development-help-requested/559/15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embedded Linux Development Help Requested</a></p>

            		<p>Many companies and organizations would benefit by providing an app to supplement their core products or services. Better yet, broaden their customer base using apps. Among the common business cases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restaurants, fast-food, and take-outs can provide table reservation or delivery services through an app. Including payment or pre-payment via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pay">Apple Pay</a> – even real-time offers via push notifications.</li>
<li>Radio and television could broadcast wider through the Internet and at better fidelity than what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting">FM</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high_frequency">UHF</a> band allocations can provide.</li>
<li>Magazine and newspaper companies can extend their subscriptions to electronic media and provide offline electronic copies to subscribers immediately upon publishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>However “making apps” is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_competency">core competence</a> of these companies. Worse, many are small businesses couldn’t spare the budget to develop, maintain, and continuously enhance bespoke mobile apps.</p>
<p>Enter the <em><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product">white-labeled</a> apps</em> business model. These are <em>generic</em> apps each developed to serve a certain business stereotype — such as <em>Generic Fast-Food App</em>, <em>Generic Radio App</em>, or <em>Generic Magazine App</em> to name a few. The developer would develop the app once and re-sell it into many clients that fits the app’s stereotype. Better yet provide on-going maintenance contract to deliver bug fixes and continuous enhancements as long as the agreement is in place.</p>
<p>Unlike a <em>full custom software development</em> engagement, white-labeled apps affords a limited set of customizations. These are likely the company logo, application icon, and a custom color scheme. The tradeoffs are time and cost. By having a pre-made app, clients would quickly get a functioning app to complement their business without needing large up-front investment nor wait a long time for a custom app to get developed.</p>
<p>Sure these pre-made apps are going to look somewhat similar from one client company to the next, since they use the same code base. But as long as each instance of the app caters for different audiences, users aren’t likely to realize it.</p>
<h2>Apple Hated White Label</h2>
<p>Except for Apple. Notably the <em>app reviewers</em> – gatekeepers of the App Store. They would <em>notice</em> the same app being uploaded multiple times differing in name and icon. The company call this <em>template-based apps</em> and seems to have a dislike towards it.</p>
<p>Apple believes that each app would need to provide <em>a unique user experience</em> to earn a place in the App Store. Understandable for a company whose livelihood hinges on user experience and innovation. However that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview">world-view</a> doesn’t align with the <em>white label business model</em> which involves identical products which differs in packaging and marketing since they are offered for different target markets – however the all has <em>the same core functionality</em>. It clashes to an extent that Apple rejected white-label apps by means of <em><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#spam">Guideline 4.3</a></em> and label them as <em>spam</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spam … Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase…</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of developers were “more fortunate” and treated with somewhat more attention than receiving a <em>copy and paste</em> from the App Review Guidelines:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that your radio and TV apps are individually branded. However, they share the same concept and feature set. It is no longer appropriate to submit multiple apps that provide the same or similar feature set.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was the end for all white-labeled apps from the store. Because “… multiple apps that provide the same or similar feature set…” is <em>the essence</em> of white-label. Indeed, a number of smaller software companies closed down and in other instances developers were dismissed because of this rule’s enforcement.</p>
<h2>Government Intervention</h2>
<p>Until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">congress-member</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/">Ted W Lieu sent a letter to Tim Cook on 1 December 2017</a> criticizing how the rules were enforced:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, I was informed that Apple’s decision to more stringently enforce its policy guidelines regarding design and functionality (Guidelines 4.3 and 4.2.6 respectively) may result in the wholesale rejection of template-based apps from the App Store. It is my understanding that <strong>many small business, research organizations, and religious institutions rely on template apps when they do not possess the resources to develop apps in-house</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then Apple made concession. Template-based apps <em>are now allowed</em> in the App Store as long as it is published by the company which owned its content. These <em>client companies</em> would need to have an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/">Apple Developer Program</a> (ADP) account and the app would need to be uploaded from that account. Therefore this should prevent an app developer from spamming the App Store with multiple identical apps yet allows organizations not having in-house software development capability to provide apps for their audiences via white-labeled apps.</p>
<p>The change is reflected in the updated App Review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality">Guideline 4.2.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>… Apps created from a commercialized template or app generation service will be rejected unless they are submitted directly by the provider of the app’s content. These services should not submit apps on behalf of their clients ….</p></blockquote>
<p>The key phrase is ”… on behalf of their clients….” Apple expects to deal with <em>the entity providing the content</em> directly, by means of the ADP account.</p>
<h2>Managing White-Labeled Apps</h2>
<p>If you’re a white-label app provider, you would need to ask your clients to have their own ADP accounts. In turn you upload the client’s customized app bundle via this account, and thus have it appear to be provided directly by the client. You can ask them to register themselves to Apple or you can register it for them.</p>
<p>When you are registering for the client, be sure to have these ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copy of the organization’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_incorporation">letter of incorporation</a> showing creation of the legal entity (this should have the <em>legal name</em> of the entity, among other details).</li>
<li>The entity’s headquarter address.</li>
<li>The entity’s mailing address.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>legal</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>financial</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>marketing</em> contact.</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>technical</em> contact (that’s likely you since you’re registering the account for them).</li>
<li>The entity’s primary <em>senior management</em> contact.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Universal_Numbering_System">D-U-N-S number</a> for the entity — you can register for one at no cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the ADP account is ready (or your client already has one), you would need to be granted access at least to the <em>Developer</em> and <em>App Manager</em> roles in the account. Unless your client has an employee filling the <em>App Manager</em> role, which in turn would create the app entry for you and assign you with a <em>Developer</em> role for the app(s) you are providing.</p>
<p>To add people to the ADP account and give access to these roles, follow these steps in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Users and Access</em>.</li>
<li>Click on the “+” button.</li>
<li>Enter First Name, Last name, and e-mail. Note that the <em>e-mail</em> should also be an Apple ID.</li>
<li>Tick the <em>App Manager</em> and <em>Developer</em> checkboxes.</li>
<li>Click on “Invite”.</li>
</ol>
<p><img title="app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png" src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png" alt="App store connect new user" width="744" height="390" data-lazy-src="https://cutecoder.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/app-store-connect-new-user@2x.png?is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>That’s it. Apple will send an e-mail to the address that the person can signed in and access the ADP account.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>If you currently have white-labeled apps in the store, you should prepare to transition your clients’ apps out from your ADP and into your respective clients’. Otherwise App Review would likely stop the next update with <em>Guideline 4.3 “Spam”</em> rejection. If you reach that point, you <em>could</em> ask for appeal and let that particular update go through, but likely App Review would give you about two months grace period to transition your apps out — which could be risky if any one of your client is lagging behind. To be safe, ensure that <em>all</em> of your clients to have their own ADP before you update any of the white-labeled apps.</p>
<p>When a client have its ADP ready, you can <a href="https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/deved688524f">transfer the existing app</a> into the client’s account. Preferably you would have transferred <em>all</em> white-labeled apps out before you update any of them (or before the release of a new major operating system version which requires you to update).</p>
<p>If you’re thinking to get into the white-labeled app business, take into account that clients need to have their own ADP and pay its annual fees. Either you:</p>
<ul>
<li>register and manage these accounts for them (and build the subscription and management cost into your price structure);</li>
<li>get them to subscribe to ADP themselves and give you access to it; or</li>
<li>provide them with a binary build of the white-labeled app and have a competent IT person from their side to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">re-sign</a> the build and upload it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for now. Stay safe and stay in business.</p>

August 6, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

    <p>One of my observations about computer software is no matter how much I know there is something new to learn every day.</p>

    <p>I have been using SSH for many years. I use a local <code>config</code> file and multiple key pairs to connect to remote systems.</p>

    <p>Occasionally an SSH session times out or somehow freezes. Often this leaves the terminal window in a frozen state, requiring a forced closure.</p>

    <p>Except a forced closure might not be needed. There is a built-in SSH escape trigger.</p>

    <p>Press the <code>~</code> (tilde) key. Notice that the <code>~</code> won’t appear on screen when the character is the very first character typed. The character prints on screen normally when not the first character.</p>

    <p>To view a list of available options with this escape trigger type <code>~?</code>.</p>

    <p>To force terminate a frozen SSH session, press <code>~.</code>. The result is much the same as <code>Ctrl+C</code> or <code>Ctrl+D</code> to terminate a process.</p>

    <p>The escape character can be changed using the <code>-e</code> option.</p>

   			Deutsche Zusammenfassung (German abstract) </p><h4>Explosion in Beirut verursacht starke Schockwellen -<br>
			   Infraschall, hydroakustische und seismische Signale <br> 
                           werden von der BGR registriert und untersucht</h4><p>

Stärke der Explosion in Beirut entsprach 1.100 Tonnen TNT
			</p><p>
				Die verheerende Explosion in Beirut (Libanon) am 4. August um 18:08 Uhr Lokalzeit, 
				bei der mehr als 100 Menschen getötet und Tausende verletzt wurden, haben seismologische und 
				Infraschall-Stationen im Umkreis von mehreren tausend Kilometern Entfernung registriert. Auch 
				Stationen der Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR) empfingen die Signale. An Hand der 
				vorliegenden Daten hat die BGR jetzt die Stärke der Explosion berechnet.
			</p>
			<p>
			Nach offiziellen Mitteilungen sind bei dem Ereignis in Beirut etwa 2.700 Tonnen Ammoniumnitrat explodiert. Selbst auf Zypern hörten Menschen die Explosion. Der nicht-hörbare Schall der Explosion wurde sogar an Infraschall-Stationen in 9.000 km Entfernung auf den Bermuda-Inseln aufgezeichnet, ebenso an seismologischen und hydroakustischen Stationen im Umkreis von bis zu 400 km. Daten dieser Stationen wurden von der BGR analysiert, um die Signale der Explosion zuzuordnen und die Quellstärke abzuschätzen. Anhand der seismologischen Daten kann die Stärke der Erschütterungen nach Berechnungen der BGR mit einer Magnitude von 3,5 abgeschätzt werden. Für die Abschätzung der Sprengkraft der Explosion ist jedoch die Verwendung des Infraschalls besonders relevant. Hier ergibt sich auf Grundlage der Aufzeichnungen an den Stationen eine Ladungsmenge von bis zu 1.100 Tonnen TNT-äquivalent. Ein Wert, der mit den offiziellen libanesischen Meldungen übereinstimmt, da Ammoniumnitrat als Sprengstoff etwa halb so wirksam ist wie TNT.

			</p><p>
A huge explosion struck the city of Beirut, Lebanon on the 4th of August 2020 around 18:08 local time (15:08 UTC). It was most likely caused by the combustion of 2700 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a harbor warehouse, as announced by the government shortly afterwards. The explosion led to thousands of casualties with more than one hundred fatalities. An enormous shock wave following the explosion caused immense damage to buildings and infrastructure, destroying houses, cars and windows all over the city. 
</p>

<p>
The boom of the explosion was heard all over Lebanon and even reached Cyprus. The sub-audible analog of this shock wave was registered by infrasound sensors of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), traveling through the atmosphere to distances up to 9000 km. Seismic and hydroacoustic signals from the explosion propagated through the solid earth and water and were recorded at nearby seismometers.
</p>

<p>
Data from regional seismometers (available via FDSN services from GEOFON and IRIS) and global IMS infrasound arrays (available to BGR as the German National Data Center of the CTBT) were analyzed by BGR to derive origin time and seismic magnitude and allow source localization as well as yield estimation. 
</p>
<h4>Near-field source characterization using seismometers</h4>
<p>
Clear signals related to the explosion were registered at 16 seismic stations in distances of up to 400 km from the epicenter. The locations of these 16 stations are shown in Figure 1a. The 12 stations from networks GE, IS and KO are traditional surface seismometers, while the 4 stations from the network IM are so called ocean bottom seismometers, devices directly placed on the seabed. Waveform plots from these 16 stations are presented in Figure 1b. At all 12 surface stations (grey traces) a clear direct P-phase arrival can be observed at the theoretically predicted arrival time. These direct P-phase arrivals can also be observed weakly at the 4 ocean bottom sensors (blue traces). Instead of the direct P-phase arrivals hydroacoustic phases can be observed at the ocean bottom sensors. These hydroacoustic phases propagate in water from the the explosion site in Beirut harbor through the eastern Mediterranean Sea to the 4 ocean bottom seismometers south of Cyprus with phase speeds of approximately 1.5 km/s. Data from the 16 seismic stations can be used to obtain information about source time, epicenter of the explosion and strength of the event in terms of moment magnitude. Moment tensor inversions using the probabilistic source optimization algorithm Grond (included in the Pyrocko framework and obtainable from pyrocko.org) result in the following source parameters of the explosion:

<h4>Far-field source characterization using infrasound</h4>
<p>
Infrasound, which is sub-audible sound below the threshold of human hearing, propagates in atmospheric waveguides over large distances. Signals related to the Beirut explosion are recorded at eight IMS infrasound arrays in distances up to 9000 km. The most clear and long-lasting signals are observed at the three stations I48TN (Tunisia, 2398 km distance), I26DE (Germany, 2450 km distance) and I17CI (Ivory Coast, 5129 km distance), which are presented in Figure 2. Azimuth and apparent sound speed information can be derived from the explosion signals for source localization using the Progressive Multi-Channel Correlation (PMCC) method. Furthermore, signal amplitude and signal period at maximum amplitude can be derived for yield estimation. An additional feature visible in the station recordings is the separation of the signal into various pressure pulses. These are not related to different explosions (only the largest eruption of the ammonium nitrate generating a strong shock is estimated to be observed at such large distances, not any precursory, smaller explosions) but to the separation of signal energy into different propagation paths. Infrasound propagates from the source to the receivers in a stratospheric waveguide, where signal energy is continuously reflected between the ground or sea surface and a region of the atmosphere with increased effective sound speed in about 50 km altitude. The explosion is also registered at five further IMS infrasound arrays (I31KZ in Kazakhstan, I43RU in Russia, I42PT on Azores, I11CV on Kap Verde Islands, I51GB on Bermuda), but with a lower signal content and higher parameter uncertainty. This is why those stations are used for localization but not yield estimation.

<h4>Source localization and yield estimation using infrasound</h4>

<p>
Infrasound recordings at different stations are useful for detecting and locating remote or undercover explosions worldwide. Despite the known origin of the devastating explosion in Beirut, this capability of the IMS infrasound network can be demonstrated using the PMCC results.
</p>

<p>
The cross-bearing approach relies on the triangulation of the mean PMCC azimuths that are associated with the event. The detected azimuths are projected along the great-circle propagation path for three stations at a time. If all of these projections intersect, the geographical center is the presumed origin of this three-station combination. For instance, I26DE, I48TN and I17CI (shown in Figure 2) would result in [33.72°N, 34.20°E], thus deviating about 120 km to the southwest from the actual location. This procedure is subsequently repeated for all conceivable combinations of all stations that detected the event. The actual location is calculated as the longitudinal and latitudinal mean (red cross in Figure 3) of the single triangulation results. Here, the PMCC results were corrected by the atmospheric propagation conditions, based on a method applied by Pilger et al. (2018). The corrections were obtained using high-resolution analysis data of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) combined with climatological wind and temperature data, resulting in correction terms between -1.7° (I48TN) and +1.1° (I26DE). Taking all stations shown in Figure 3 into account, the determined source location using …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blog-article posted="2020-08-06T22:23:05Z"><p><img src="https://john-millikin.com/first-impressions-of-rust/crab.jpg"></p><p>I've been wanting to write a big project in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> for a while as a learning exercise, and actually started one in late 2018 (a FUSE server implementation). But then life happened and I got busy and never went anywhere with it. Due to certain world circumstances I'm currently spending a lot of time indoors so <a href="https://github.com/jmillikin/rust-fuse">rust-fuse</a> (<a href="https://jmillikin.github.io/rust-fuse/fuse-v0.0.1-a6ad16d1127d36f80e6d02f36e48da56920ca693/fuse/">docs</a>) now exists and is good enough to write basic hello-world filesystems. I plan to polish it up a bit more with the goal of releasing a v1.0 that supports the same use cases as <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">libfuse</a>.</p><p>I took some notes along the way about things that struck me as especially good or bad. Overall I quite like Rust the language, have mixed feelings about the quality of ancillary tooling, and have strong objections to some decisions made by the packaging system (Cargo + crates.io).</p><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Background</h2><p>I've been programming professionally for 15 years, primarily network servers and GUIs on Linux. Between roughly 2009 and 2015 I experimented with using Haskell for systems programming, writing several projects in pure Haskell (<a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-dbus">haskell-dbus</a>, <a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/anansi">Anansi</a>) and as bindings (<a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-ncurses">haskell-ncurses</a>, <a href="https://john-millikin.com/software/haskell-cpython">haskell-cpython</a>). However, I couldn't achieve the sorts of reliability improvements over bread-and-butter C++ that I had hoped for:</p><ul><li>Haskell has a lot of tools for reasoning about the structure of computation, notably monads for declarative I/O, but it doesn't do much to help the programmer with non-algorithmic concerns such as memory lifetimes. I spent a lot of time debugging dangling pointers and race conditions.</li><li>I found it very difficult to write Haskell code that could run as fast as C. Avoiding allocation, auto-boxing, etc felt like it required a deep knowledge of undocumented or unspecified GHC behavior.</li></ul><p>In late 2015 I started rough sketches for a new language, Funk, that would combine the type-safety of Haskell with the low-level precision of C/C++. Funk was strongly influenced by Google's internal dialect of C++, which uses smart pointers and sum types (e.g. <tt>StatusOr&lt;T&gt;</tt>) to improve memory safety – many of its features later became part of the C++11 and C++14 standards. To this foundation I bolted on Haskell-style typeclasses and modules, then started writing a Funk-to-C translator based on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Documentation">Vala</a>.</p><p>At some point I was looking around for inspiration on how to handle memory allocation (I planned to use scoped arenas as the fundamental dynamic memory system) and I discovered Rust. Here was a language that was solving the same problems as Funk but (1) better designed (2) already implemented and (3) supported by an entire team of compiler experts. So that was that, Funk went to <tt>/dev/null</tt> and I logged a TODO to learn Rust.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">The Rust language</h2><p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that someone looking for a cross between C++ and Haskell would like Rust, but I want to be clear: I really <i>really</i> enjoy using Rust. It is nearly everything I want in a systems programming language, and the few parts it's missing are due to legitimate technical difficulty. The amount of careful thought I've seen put into its design – crafting <tt>async/await</tt> to work in <tt>no_std</tt> environments, or the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/06/08/new-inline-asm.html">new inline assembly syntax</a> – has produced a language that is not only better than what I could have designed, it's better among axes I was not even aware existed prior to reading the Rust RFCs.</p><p>The "nightly" release channel is an excellent idea that I wish more infrastructure software made use of. Stabilizing individual features on their own schedules lets the compiler maintain a blistering release cadence (stable releases every <i>six weeks</i>!). Users are empowered to choose their own preferred point on the maintenance/velocity curve, opting in to higher upgrade costs in exchange for early access to new features. The "editions" system goes a bit further, derisking backwards-incompatible syntax changes that would have stymied C++ for decades (see: trigraphs).</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Type system</h3><p>Rust has a reasonable amount of Haskell-style type programming, though I wouldn't mind a <i>bit</i> more. Some parts of its type system are limited in non-intuitive ways – for example only lifetime-kinded type parameters can be universally quantified in a trait bound. I hit a lot of compiler errors that recognized exactly what I wanted to do but wouldn't let me do it.</p><p>I wish Rust's type system supported:</p><ul><li>Closed-world ("sealed") traits. Rust's rules against private types in the public API are good civilization but they make it difficult to define pseudo-private traits like <tt>Mount</tt> that I want users to name but not implement or call into.</li><li>Associated types in structs. Rust lets traits have associated types, and structs can have associated <i>values</i>, but there's no equivalent to the nested type names found in C++ or Java.</li><li>Very basic dependent typing, or maybe something like Eiffel's contracts, for the purpose of eliminating array bounds checks. I'd like to be able to say "this function accepts a <tt>&amp;[u8]</tt> of at least <tt>size_of&lt;SomeType&gt;</tt>" so I can do safe unchecked byte poking.</li></ul></blog-section><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Standard library</h3><p>There's a lot of standard UNIX functionality that's missing from the Rust standard library. Some of it is more-or-less available from separate packages like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nix">nix</a>, but I shouldn't have to depend on four crates plus a C compiler to get access to <tt>getuid()</tt>. I shouldn't have to depend on <i>anything</i> to get the definition of <tt>ENOSYS</tt> or the size of <tt>c_ulong</tt>. Go is the gold standard here – it can cross-compile to a Linux target from macOS using its own copies of the Linux syscall table – and even Haskell has <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Foreign-C-Types.html"><tt>Foreign.C.Types</tt></a>.</p><p>A <tt>std::os::unix</tt> without <tt>getuid()</tt> is incomplete but can be worked around with a small <tt>extern "C"</tt> block. Much worse is the lack of macro-dependent functions like <tt>recvmsg()</tt>, which is not a great API to begin with, or functions with OS-dependent arity like <tt>mount()</tt>. Rust is not averse to providing clean wrappers around the OS library – the <tt>std::fs</tt> and <tt>std::process</tt> modules contain little else – so it's frustrating to see these very basic functions left out.</p></blog-section></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Tooling</h2><blog-section><h3 slot="title">rustdoc</h3><p>I categorize documentation generators into two basic groups:</p><ul><li>First is the <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> group, which consumes prose and uses embedded pragmas to reference symbols of the library being documented. The output layout tends to be textbook-like, containing long "chapters" that might cover entire modules in one HTML file. Sphinx-style docs are popular among Python programmers.</li><li>Second is the <a href="https://www.doxygen.nl/">Doxygen</a> group, which consumes source code and generates a rigidly-structured catalog of symbols with optional attached prose. The output feels more like an encyclopedia or reference manual.</li></ul><p><tt>rustdoc</tt> is obviously in the second category. It is designed to consume doc comments, which are special-cased by the Rust compiler, and produces output closely matching the structure of the exported API. At this task <tt>rustdoc</tt> does a reasonable job: the page layout is navigable, the markup format (<tt>rustdoc</tt> uses Markdown) isn't great but it could be worse, and it doesn't hardcode absolute file paths into the output like Haddock.</p><p>Some of its annotations, like whether a symbol is OS-specific (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43781">rust-lang/rust#43781</a>), are gated to the Nightly toolchain. It's not obvious to me why they do this – it's a documentation generator, why does it care what version of the Rust compiler I'm using? What's more, some of its functionality is reserved for the standard library only. I can't mark fields as unstable (subject to change in future library versions) because that annotation is based on the <tt>#[unstable]</tt> attribute, which the compiler reserves for its own use. Ditto for annotations about which version a symbol was added in. If I'm going to use a Doxygen-group tool then I don't want it to get too fussy about what libraries it's documenting.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h3 slot="title">rustfmt</h3><p>Something like a cross between <tt>gofmt</tt>, <tt>clang-format</tt>, and GNU indent. It has a lot of configuration options but all the interesting ones are gated to Nightly, and most of those are much less useful than you might expect.</p><p>As a representative sample, consider <tt>rustfmt</tt>'s handling of hard tabs. Given the following input there are two basic ways you might use hard tabs to indent it, depending on whether struct value alignment should apply to nested structs:</p><blog-code><pre>MyStruct{
  field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name + another_big_complex_variable_name),
  another_field: 123,
  nested_struct: &amp;NestedStruct{
    nested_struct_field: 456,
  },
  final_field: 123,
}
</pre></blog-code><p>The first is to treat the nested struct as a "break" in the alignment (<tt>gofmt</tt> does this). I've drawn the tabs as <span>████</span> for clarity:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct{
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████</span>                       + another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct: &amp;NestedStruct{
<span>████████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>},
<span>████</span>final_field: 123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>The second is to align all the values, including the nested struct, and introduce a nested layer of tabs:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct{
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████</span>                       + another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct:        &amp;NestedStruct{
<span>████</span>                      <span>████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>                      },
<span>████</span>final_field:          123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>But what <tt>rustfmt</tt> produces is an indecisive and poorly formatted combo of the two – it doesn't even properly align the parenthesized expression after line-breaking it:</p><blog-code><pre><code>MyStruct {
<span>████</span>field_with_long_name: (some_big_complex_variable_name
<span>████████</span>+ another_big_complex_variable_name),
<span>████</span>another_field:        123,
<span>████</span>nested_struct:        &amp;NestedStruct {
<span>████████</span>nested_struct_field: 456,
<span>████</span>},
<span>████</span>final_field:          123,
}
</code></pre></blog-code><p>I eventually gave up on trying to make the formatted rust-fuse code look pretty, and settled for "consistent".</p></blog-section></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Cargo and crates.io</h2><p>While the Rust language feels carefully designed to combine the best parts of multiple popular and interesting languages, Rust's default build system (Cargo) and package repository (crates.io) are the opposite. They combine the worst parts of Cabal/Hackage and NPM, resulting in a user experience that is somehow inferior to both.</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Pa…</h3></blog-section></blog-section></blog-article></div></div>

<p>
Good news on a slow August day: you no longer have to install any system wide native library
to use <a href="https://neanderthal.uncomplicate.org/">Neanderthal</a>() on the CPU!
It is enough to add an optional dependency to Bytedeco's MKL redistribution jar in you project
configuration (Lein, deps, boot), and everything will work out of the box for you!
</p>

<p>
Did I have to do a lot of work to support it? Yes and no! No, in a sense that I only
had to add 4 lines of Clojure code at the appropriate place in the depths of Neanderthal.
No, in a sense that this is something that already worked if you added similar 4 lines
of Clojure code in the appropriate place in you project. Yes, in a sense that Neanderthal
was designed from the start to be technology-agnostic and support as many CPU, GPU,
and other engines as Clojure programmers are eager to explore.
</p>

<p>
This is one small step code-wise, but a big leap convenience-wise. The major <i>perceived</i>
pain point for the new users was the requirement to install MKL on your system. It is
a simple step anyway. On Arch Linux it is literally <code>pacman -Syu intel-mkl</code>. That was all.
But still, habits are strange beasts, and Clojure and Java programmers fight tooth and
nail against using anything outside repository jars. Which is reasonable. But still…
The performance benefits of MKL, CUDA, and OpenCL are enormous. Didn't matter for most
people. Turn on the light! OK. There is light now :)
</p>

<p>
Of course, I still recommend using the system-wide MKL. That's 750 MB that can sit in
your system instead of your jars. That's 750 MB that you don't have to update all the time
if you don't like. 750 MB that can be used by other software on your machine (NumPy, TensorFlow, whatever).
</p>

<p>
However, I <i>do</i> appreciate that, if you're eager to try Neanderthal you would like to
open your REPL and learn how to write high performance Clojure code right away, instead of
fiddling with the configuration of your OS (especially if you're a Windows user).
 That's why this tiny update is major news.
</p>

<p>
So, let's show some code. The <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/neanderthal/tree/master/examples/hello-world">Hello World</a> example in the Neanderthal repository
has been updated with the optional MKL jar, and it looks like this:
</p>

<pre>(defproject hello-world "0.35.0"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.1"]
                 [uncomplicate/neanderthal "0.35.0"]
                 ;;Optional. If bytedeco is not present, a system-wide MKL is used.
                 [org.bytedeco/mkl-platform-redist "2020.1-1.5.3"]]
  ;; If on Java 9+, you have to uncomment the following JVM option.
  :jvm-opts ^:replace [#_"--add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.ref=ALL-UNNAMED"])
</pre>

<p>
If the <code>mkl-platform-redist</code> jar is present, Neanderthal will load the native binaries
for your OS from there. If it's not, it is expected that you have MKL somewhere on your
system's <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
There's noting else that changed. Here's the old example from Hello World:
</p>

<pre>(ns hello-world.native
  (:require [uncomplicate.neanderthal
             [core :refer :all]
             [native :refer :all]]))

    Thanks to Tom (AKA joinr) for exploring this and (very politely and subtly)
nudging me to automate it for all users.

<p>
Enjoy!

This post will be about trying <a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, one of the most wonderful tools that we have for NLP tasks in Python.</p><p>Today's objective is to get us acquainted with spaCy and NLP. We will write some code to build a small knowledge graph that will contain structured information extracted from unstructured text. The entire code for the project can be found at the end of this article.</p><h2 id="article-overview">Article overview</h2><ul><li>Information extraction and knowledge graphs</li><li>Building a knowledge graph with python and spaCy</li></ul><p><strong>Information extraction</strong> is a technique of extracting structured information from unstructured text. This means taking a raw text(say an article) and processing it in such way that we can extract information from it in a format that a computer understands and can use. This is a very difficult problem in NLP because human language is so complex and lots of words can have a different meaning when we put it in a different context.</p><p>Information extraction consists of several, more focused subfields, each of them having difficult problems to solve. For example, here's an approach to using information extraction techniques for performing <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-building-a-personal-knowledge-management-system-part-1-named-entity-recognition/">named entity recognition</a>. Another subfield which has gained much interest from the community is <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/machine-learning-project-series-part-2-python-keywords-extraction/">keywords extraction</a>.</p><p>A <strong>knowledge graph</strong> is a way of storing data that resulted from an information extraction task. Many basic implementations of knowledge graphs make use of a concept we call <strong>triple</strong>, that is a set of three items(a subject, a predicate and an object) that we can use to store information about something. Let's take this sentence as an example:</p><blockquote>London is the capital of England. Westminster is located in London.</blockquote><p>After some basic processing which we will see later, we would 2 triples like this:</p><blockquote>(London, be capital, England), (Westminster, locate, London)</blockquote><p>So in this example we have three unique entities(London, England and Westminster) and two relations(be capital, locate). To build a knowledge graph, we only have two associated nodes in the graph with the entities and vertices with the relations and we will get something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-26-at-17.48.39.png" alt="Python spaCy NLP Tutorial - Building a Knowledge Graph"><figcaption>Knowledge graph representation</figcaption></figure><p>So what is the use case for this? Imagine if we ask a computer where Westminster is located. Or what is the capital of England. We would only have to search the graph for the right relation and extract the correct entities at both sides of it. This is a simple use case for a very basic example, but knowledge graphs are used quite a lot today in many Machine Learning tasks by some of the biggest companies(you know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a>, right?)</p><p>We will write together a very basic implementation of a small knowledge graph. All the code is available on Github if you want to check it you(feel free to star it so that I know you've found it useful in any way).</p><p>We will use these sentences for our knowledge graph. Some of the text is taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">Wikipedia</a>, while some of it was manually added.</p><blockquote>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.London is located in the southeast of England.Westminster is located in London.London is the biggest city in Britain. London has a population of 7,172,036.</blockquote><p>We will be using Python3 for this implementation and spaCy, which we'll install using pip.</p><figure><pre><code>pip install spacy</code></pre><figcaption>Installing spaCy</figcaption></figure><p>After the installation, we need to download spaCy's model for English language. This is as simple as it gets:</p><figure><pre><code>python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm</code></pre><figcaption>Download spaCy's model for English language</figcaption></figure><p>Now you can open up your favourite editor and we are good to go. Here's what we are going to do:</p><ul><li>Import our dependencies</li><li>Use spaCy to split the text in sentences</li><li>For each sentence, use spaCy to figure out what kind of word is every word in that sentence: is it a subject, an object, a predicate and so on</li><li>Use the information from above to figure out where in the triple we should put a word</li><li>Finally build the triples</li><li>Build and show the knowledge graph</li></ul><p>Every sentence is split into tokens, meaning every word or punctuation mark is taken by spaCy and we can use that to figure out what kind of word we have. When processing is being done, spaCy attaches a tag called <strong><em>dep_</em></strong> to every word so that we know a word is either a subject, an object and so on. For example, for the first sentence in our text we will get:</p><p><em>London -&gt; nsubj<br>is -&gt; ROOT<br>the -&gt; det<br>capital -&gt; attr<br>and -&gt; cc<br>largest -&gt; amod<br>city -&gt; conj<br>of -&gt; prep<br>England -&gt; pobj<br>and -&gt; cc<br>the -&gt; det<br>United -&gt; compound<br>Kingdom -&gt; conj<br>. -&gt; punct</em></p><p>I honestly recommend to checkout the meaning of these tags in spaCy's documentation because there are so many and they are different for every language. </p><p>For the simplicity of this example, I've chosen to extract a single triple from every sentence. Moreover, I am choosing only a few tags to enter the triples, but you can choose a lot more depending on what you want to achieve. This is for example what I chose:</p><pre><code># Tags I've chosen for relations
deps = ["ROOT", "adj", "attr", "agent", "amod"]

# Tags I've chosen for entities(subjects and objects)
deps = ["compound", "prep", "conj", "mod"]</code></pre><p>Obviously, for a given triple, relations and entities can be built using more than one word. We want to capture the information like <em>(London, be capital, England)</em>, not just <em>(London, be, England) </em>which has a totally different meaning.</p><p>Having all of these said, this is the main skeleton of the algorithm. You can see there are a few calls to other methods you will be able to see later, but for now we can just get the basic idea.</p><pre><code>def processSubjectObjectPairs(tokens):
    subject = ''
    object = ''
    relation = ''
    subjectConstruction = ''
    objectConstruction = ''
    for token in tokens:
        printToken(token)
        if "punct" in token.dep_:
            continue
        if isRelationCandidate(token):
            relation = appendChunk(relation, token.lemma_)
        if isConstructionCandidate(token):
            if subjectConstruction:
                subjectConstruction = appendChunk(subjectConstruction, token.text)
            if objectConstruction:
                objectConstruction = appendChunk(objectConstruction, token.text)
        if "subj" in token.dep_:
            subject = appendChunk(subject, token.text)
            subject = appendChunk(subjectConstruction, subject)
            subjectConstruction = ''
        if "obj" in token.dep_:
            object = appendChunk(object, token.text)
            object = appendChunk(objectConstruction, object)
            objectConstruction = ''

    return (subject.strip(), relation.strip(), object.strip())</code></pre><p>So what we are doing is basically taking every token(meaning every word and every punctuation mark) and putting it in a category. After we have reached the end of a sentence, we clear up the whitespaces which might have remained and then we're good to go, we have obtained a triple. Before adding the word to a triple, we first perform <a href="https://programmerbackpack.com/lemmatization-and-stemming-in-nlp-the-complete-practical-guide/">word lemmatization</a>. We can use this and the networkx and pyplot libraries to build the Knowledge Graph. Here is the code for displaying the graph.</p><pre><code>def printGraph(triples):
    G = nx.Graph()
    for triple in triples:
        G.add_node(triple[0])
        G.add_node(triple[1])
        G.add_node(triple[2])
        G.add_edge(triple[0], triple[1])
        G.add_edge(triple[1], triple[2])

    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
    plt.figure()
    nx.draw(G, pos, edge_color='black', width=1, linewidths=1,
            node_size=500, node_color='seagreen', alpha=0.9,
            labels={node: node for node in G.nodes()})
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.show()</code></pre><p>Depending on the information you are trying to capture, it is possible that you will not obtain only one graph, but several, disconnected graphs of various size. This of course is less likely to happen with huge amounts of complete data, but for this case and the example I chose, it happened that we obtained four different graphs. Here is the Knowledge Graph we were able to build with our code.</p><figure><img src="https://programmerbackpack.com/content/images/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-01-at-16.00.39.png" alt="Python spaCy NLP Tutorial - Building a Knowledge Graph"><figcaption>Obtaining the Knowledge Graph</figcaption></figure><h3 id="results-analysis">Results analysis</h3><p>The knowledge graph we obtained is exceptionally small and basic but that is because we used a very small amount of data and a basic implementation. For more advanced purposes, I recommend that you use as much data as you can and try enriching the Knowledge Graph with other NLP techniques. Given the fragment I fed into the Knowledge Graph, we can see it is able to answer a few questions like:</p><ul><li>What is the capital of England?</li><li>Where is London located?</li><li>Who is London governed by?</li><li>What is the population of London?</li><li>Who was London founded by?</li></ul><p>And this is only from only paragraph of text and 99 lines of Python code. So just imagine the possibilities!</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Today we learned about Knowledge Graphs and we managed to build a small, basic one in python and spaCy. We saw some good results and also noticed areas which we can improve. We can see that NLP it's a fun domain and we can build applications to help us in our day to day activities. The code for the whole project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/bdmarius/python-knowledge-graph">Github</a>. Please be sure to start the project if you think is helpful for you.</p><p><em>Interested in more?

                    <p>Although I'm not a big fan of reviewing code together with the person who wrote it, this approach has some benefits. </p><p>Most importantly, it significantly shortens feedback loops which sometimes can last for hours and even days:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/08/image.png"><figcaption>Some fruitful conversations can take weeks</figcaption></figure><p>This would be very easy to avoid if both the author and reviewer sat together (hey, pre-pandemic world) and discussed the solution. Without any delays.</p><h3 id="what-s-wrong-with-it">What's wrong with it</h3><p>Nothing, if velocity is all you optimise for. Usually, pair-reviews are pretty efficient:</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png"><figcaption>Insidious manipulator found a shortcut</figcaption></figure><p>Did you notice the difference?

To find it out, send it to your colleague who has no prior context — can they follow it? If they can, the odds that your code is decent are pretty high.</p><h3 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h3><p>Don't let an author drive a conversation — simple as that. Same applies if you are the author — be there to answer questions and note all of them down.</p><p>If something is unclear for the reviewer, it's a sign that it needs to be more explicit. Work together to find out if you need to change the structure of your code, rewrite a small bit or just add a missing comment.</p><h3 id="the-final-part">The final part</h3><p>If you want to get your code merged as soon as possible, grab a reviewer, explain everything to them and don't take your eyes off them until it's approved.

    implement storage
</code></pre> <p>The commit structure is clean, organized, and communicates a clean trajectory of deployment.</p>  <p>A pull-request is opened against the mainline branch and a code review takes place.</p> <p>The requested changes are scattered across the clean commit history.</p> <p>A typical approach would involve making all the changes in a new commit with a comment such as "code review changes".</p> <p>This approach is reasonable but wouldn't it be nice to keep the well organized commit history designed from the beginning?</p>  <p>A Git worktree allows the same repository to exist in multiple file system directories at once.</p> <p>The worktree repository can have any branch checked out including a new one.</p> <p>To handle the code review changes but keep our commit structure the same a worktree can be created.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> git worktree add ../myrepo-pr-changes</span>
Preparing worktree (new branch 'myrepo-pr-changes')
HEAD is now at 2d27894 implement plumbing
<span>
$</span><span> <span>cd</span> ../myrepo-pr-changes</span>
</code></pre> <p>The command displayed above creates the worktree directory "myrepo-pr-changes" one directory above our current, creates the branch "myrepo-pr-changes", and check this branch out in the worktree.</p> <p>The branch "myrepo-pr-changes" will be a staging area where the changes required to pass the code review can be implemented.</p> <p>This branch allows for all the niceties of a normal topic branch, you may author commits, reset any changes which you decide are not valuable, push this branch to save your work, etc...</p>  <p>At this stage the worktree branch "myrepo-pr-changes" has all the commits necessary to comfort your code reviewers.</p> <p>It is time to get these changes back into the topic branch.</p> <p>We can diff the code between "topic-branch" and "myrepo-pr-change" worktree branch.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> git diff --name-only topic-branch myrepo-pr-changes</span>
businesslogic.go
plumbing.go
store.go
</code></pre> <p>The diff shows that specific files have changed in order to appease our code reviewers.</p> <p>An interactive rebase can get these changes into the correct commits by returning to the original repository directory.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> <span>cd</span> ../myrepo        </span>
<span>
$</span><span> git rebase -i HEAD~2</span>

</code></pre> <p>Next the interactive prompt is displayed</p> <p>By specifying "edit" in one of our commits the changes present in the diff between "topic-branch" and "myrepo-pr-changes" can be checked out.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> git rebase -i HEAD~2</span>

You can amend the commit now, with

  git commit --amend

Once you are satisfied with your changes, run

  git rebase --continue

<p>As part of the <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/littlebits-envelope-generator/">littleBits revival</a>, I pulled the <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/compare-key-size/">Arturia Keystep</a> from storage. The Keystep has a nice keybed and sequencer, and supports a wide range of interface options: 5-pin MIDI, CV, gate, sync and USB MIDI.</p>



<p>Although I love its industrial design, the Keystep keys have always been somewhat unreliable. Straight out of the box, one of the keys did not trigger reliably. After moving and storage, unfortunately, several more keys became flaky or non-operational. Time to tear down and clean! [Click images to enlarge.]</p>

<p>I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVGyr2b3gAc">Youtube video covering repair of the aftertouch ribbon</a>. Initial disassembly is straightforward: 1. Pull off the knobs. 2. Remove the 14 large screws on the bottom. 3. Carefully open the top (white or black front panel. </p>



<figure><a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2.jpg"><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2-1024x996.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2-1024x996.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2-300x292.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2-768x747.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_top_open_2-308x300.jpg 308w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Arturia Keystep aftertouch cable (connected)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The key assembly connects to the main electronics through two ribbon cables: the aftertouch cable and the key matrix cable. I marked the top side of each cable so I would know the correct cable orientation during re-assembly.</p>



<figure><a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable.jpg"><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable-1024x878.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable-1024x878.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable-300x257.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable-768x658.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_AT_cable-350x300.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Keystep aftertouch cable (disconnected)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The aftertouch cable has a four socket connector that slides over four right angle pins on the printed circuit board. Disconnecting it is easy; just slide the connector out in the same direction as the pins. Please note the black X. That’s my mark so I know how to orient the cable when putting everything back together. This is important because there isn’t an indexing mechanism for the cable and it’s possible to insert it the wrong way.</p>



<figure><a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable.jpg"><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable-1024x786.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable-1024x786.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable-300x230.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable-768x589.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_cable-391x300.jpg 391w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Keystep key matrix cable (black connector tabs open)</figcaption></figure>



<p> Next, one needs to disconnect the key matrix cable. Once again, I marked the cable in order to know its correct orientation. The cable is paper thin with exposed leads at the end. I always get faked out by these newfangled PCB cable connectors. Slide the two black tabs on either side of the connector in order to release the cable. During re-assembly, you’ll insert the cable and slide the tabs to lock the cable into place.</p>



<p> While we’re here, that’s an ST Micro STM32F103 ARM processor which is the brains of the whole operation. Ya know, for a 100 bucks (USD), there’s a lot of technology and quality built into this thing!</p>



<p>After disconnecting the cables, the front panel electronics can be separated from the keybed in the metal chassis tray. Now it’s time to remove the keybed itself by removing the 10 small screws on the bottom of the tray.</p>



<figure><a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2.jpg"><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2-1024x482.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2-1024x482.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2-300x141.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2-768x361.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/keystep_key_matrix_2-500x235.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Keystep key switch matrix PCB (ignore the missing keys)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Flip the keybed over and you see the key matrix PCB. The key matrix lets the ARM scan the key contacts. The tiny components are switching diodes. For the time being, ignore the missing keys (!). I’ll explain later…</p>



<p>Next, remove the four tiny screws holding the key matrix PCB in place. Then, carefully push back the four black plastic tabs, one at a time. Remove the PCB and flip it over.</p>



<figure><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_contacts-750x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_contacts-750x1024.jpg 750w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_contacts-220x300.jpg 220w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_contacts-768x1048.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_contacts.jpg 1551w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Now you see the actual key contacts. This is the money shot. The PCB has two maze-like traces for each contact. The black dots on the rubber contact strip make two separate electrical connections on the PCB when a key is pressed. One connection is made first, followed by the second connection. The ARM software senses the connections and measures the time between contact. The software maps this time into the MIDI note velocity.</p>



<p>At this point, I used alcohol prep pads (70% isopropyl alcohol) to clean both the PCB traces and each of the black dots on the rubber contact strip. These are the same small pads that doctors or nurses use before a finger stick test.  Be gentle! I didn’t see any visible dirt, so maybe key flakiness is due to manufacturing residue. [I’m not a smoker.] Based on Web comments, flaky Keystep keys is a common problem — a frequent problem in what is otherwise a fine product.</p>



<p>From here, you need to reverse the disassembly steps in order to nail everything back together again.</p>



<h2>Fixing broken keys or aftertouch</h2>



<p>Now, to explain the missing keys. The original video demonstrates a repair to the aftertouch strip. I naively thought that I could get access to the key contacts through the top of the keybed. <strong>You only need to remove keys when fixing the aftertouch strip or broken keys.</strong> Do not remove keys if your goal is only contact cleaning.</p>



<figure><a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs.jpg"><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs-1024x430.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs-1024x430.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs-300x126.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs-768x323.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_key_springs-500x210.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Keystep key spring detail</figcaption></figure>



<p>My mistake did create a photo-op, however. In the picture above, you see the springs which give the keys their bounce. The springs hold the keys in place. To remove a key, you need to gently push down on the spring and release the “rounded” end of the spring from the black keybed frame. These little buggers will fly off, so be careful! During re-assembly, the conical ends fit into the key holes. Stretch the spring until the rounded end fits into the corresponding pocket in the keybed frame. Another re-assembly tip: do all of the black keys first.</p>



<figure><img src="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_keys_removed-1024x717.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_keys_removed-1024x717.jpg 1024w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_keys_removed-300x210.jpg 300w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_keys_removed-768x538.jpg 768w, http://sandsoftwaresound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Keystep_keys_removed-429x300.jpg 429w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Keystep with keys removed</figcaption></figure>



<p>The final picture shows the top of each rubber contact pair poking up through the black keybed frame. These are the top sides of the rubber contacts that we cleaned. The black strip running along side the key contacts is the aftertouch strip.</p>



<p>I connected the reassembled Keystep to my PC (via USB) and got the familiar start-up light show. I launched MIDI OX and tested each key. All keys responded quickly and reliably.</p>



<p>All in all, the process was relatively easy although care must be taken. I like the Arturia Keystep and love it even more, now that all of the keys are working.</p>

<h2> <span id="Overview"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>Chameleon is an extremely user-friendly multipurpose cartridge that can be used without opening the computer. It is just plugged to the expansion port of the C64. It can also be operated as a stand-alone unit (since it's basically an FPGA computer like the <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/C-One" title="C-One">C-One</a> in a C64 cartridge case), replacing the computer, the floppy drive and the heavy power supply. A <a href="http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/Chameleon_docking_station" title="Chameleon docking station">docking station</a> providing 4 joystick ports and connectors for an Amiga or C-64 keyboard is available.

<p>If you find any bugs, please report them directly to Individual Computers using our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://forum.icomp.de/">web forum</a>. Before doing so, please make sure you are running the latest version of the Turbo Chameleon FPGA Core.
</p><p>To make it easier and more efficient for us to handle bug reports, please provide the following information with them:
</p>
<ul><li> whether you are using the Chameleon in standalone or cartridge mode
</li><li> whether you are using PAL or NTSC
</li><li> if you are using cartridge mode, then it would be helpful to know which kind of C64 it is (board revision, type of CIAs, VIC, SID). You can use <a rel="nofollow" href="http://csdb.dk/release/?id=89406">Box Check:Type</a> to get some related info without having to open the C64.
</li><li> if you are experiencing a bug in cartridge mode, also try if the same problem shows in standalone mode. sometimes certain misbehaviour can be attributed to a (partially) broken c64 - this must be ruled out first.
</li><li> a detailed description that enables us to reproduce the bug
</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="skip-nav"><p><time>02.08.2020</time> — <a href="https://strdr4605.github.io/tags/learning">learning</a>, <a href="https://strdr4605.github.io/tags/career">career</a> — <span>3<!-- --> min read</span></p><section><h3>What is a Hackathon</h3><blockquote><p>Hackathon - a usually competitive event in which people work in groups on software or hardware projects, with the goal of creating a functioning product by the end of the event.</p></blockquote><h3>My story</h3><p>In my first year at university, I participated in my first hackathon.
My team and I created <a href="https://strdr4605.github.io/fracfik">Fracfik</a>, a game that will help children learn fraction operations.
We didn't win but at that hackathon, I finished a project that I could add to my resume when applying to internships/jobs.
I was mentored by experienced people, collected feedback, listen to advice and explored people's behavior.
I learned some good practices about coding and software engineering.
In the end I gained a lot of friends and connections in software engineering community.</p><p>I enjoyed the experience at that hackathon and understood that hackathons will boost my hard and soft skills,
will open new opportunities and will make me a better software engineer and person.</p><p>In 4.5 years I participated at 35 Hackathons (I wish it was more).
I developed front-end/back-end/mobile apps and games.
Wrote code in 6+ programming languages.
Pitched ideas, led teams, mentored people.
Collected 20+ t-shirts, won tech gears, and startup investments.</p><h3>Types of Hackathons</h3><p>Not all hackathons are the same. Some are organized for <strong>programming geeks</strong> other for <strong>businesspeople</strong> mostly.
From my experience, I divide hackathons into <strong>3 types</strong>.</p><h4>1. Competitive programming hackathons</h4><p>Traditional <strong>competitive programming events</strong> defer from hackathons because at former you work alone and at latter, you work in a team.
This type of hackathons is usually based on some problems that need to be solved by implementing an algorithm.
Usually, no user interface needed, everything is based on input/output files. The team that gained most points win.
Points may be based on <em>performance</em>, <em>used memory</em>, <em>passed tests</em>. Prices may be internships at big tech companies, or university stipends.</p><h4>2. Community hackathons (my favorite)</h4><p>Usually, this type of hackathons is organized by universities, companies, programming communities.
<strong>The primary goal</strong> is to have fun, create connections, learn new skills, teach newbies, explore new technologies.
Even if there is some competition, usually teams are helping each other.
The secondary goal is to create something useful, like UI for visualization of complex data, or solving day to day problems,
like automating some simple processes. For this kind of hackathons not only programmers are involved but also graphic designers,
data analytics, and others. Someone can work on code implementation, others on data collection, others on presentation/pitching.
This is my favorite because of (see <strong>the primary goal</strong>).</p><h4>3. Startup hackathons</h4><p>Events like "Startup Weekend" are the most stressful type of hackathons.
Teams are brainstorming ideas that may have a potential success.
The goal is to prepare and present a 5-minute pitch/presentation with a prototype or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p><p>Main points:</p><ul><li>The Problem <em>(some problem that you and preferably a lot of people faces)</em></li><li>The Solution <em>(your innovative solution that will change people lives)</em></li><li>Competitors</li><li>Business plan <em>(v0 of your path to success)</em></li></ul><p>At Startup hackathons, there is no need for a team full of programmers.
1-2 programmers per team are sufficient, the reset should be salespeople, designers, public speakers
and people that are professionals in the domain of startup ideas.
The winning price is usually the first investment in the startup and also mentorship from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator">accelerators</a>.
If you are a programmer looking to improve your technical skills at Startup hackathons,
be ready to lose a lot because while you will spend 20+ hours trying to learn and debug a new technology (or a CSS layout bug),
The team with no programmers and only public speakers will blow judges' minds with a mockup on some slides.</p><p>Good parts of Startup hackathons for programmers (and not only) are the possibility to increase your soft skills.
After 3+ failed hackathons you understand that you should start preparing the pitch not 2 hours before the final presentation,
but even before writing any code.</p><h3>From 0 to 30+ Hackathons</h3><p>At the beginning, you are scary because there are a lot of people around that are talking about unknowns things.
You are looking for guidance and trying to learn new things quickly.
Hackathons motivate you to do more work in 24 hours that in the last month at home.
When winning you are enthusiastic and feel like a superhero. When losing you are desperate and feel like shit.</p><p>Soon you understand that it's an opportunity to create new connections. Reunite with other hackathon enthusiasts.
Enjoy the free presentations, free food, gifts. You don't care so much about winning and enjoy the hackathon as a whole.
You start changing your roles in the team. Last time you were coding, this time you are preparing and pitching the idea.
Make fun/stupid/quick projects that can be delivered in 24 hours like <a href="https://tum-faf.github.io/spacebook/">Spacebook</a>.</p><p>Later you are more motivated in mentoring newbies and showing them the value of the hackathons. Maybe become a mentor or a judge.
Or join a team to help them promote their idea or learn new staff.
Speak with organizers, give feedback, propose ideas for future events.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Hackathons are not mandatory to become a successful programmer, but they help you to achieve this goal faster.
Why wouldn't you accept the opportunity to bust all your skills for free? Don't give up if you didn't like your first hackathon experience.
Participate in another one, learn from mistakes from previous. Feel and enjoy the spirit of competition.</p><p>See you at the next hackathon😉.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p><em><strong>Cover image:</strong> Detail from&nbsp;Patroclus&nbsp;by Jacques Louis David, 1780.&nbsp;Courtesy Wikipedia</em></p>



<p>It’s tempting to think of the mind as a layer that sits on top of more primitive cognitive structures. We experience ourselves as conscious beings, after all, in a way that feels different to the rhythm of our heartbeat or the rumblings of our stomach. If the operations of the brain can be separated out and stratified, then perhaps we can construct something akin to just the top layer, and achieve <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/can-we-make-consciousness-into-an-engineering-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human-like artificial intelligence</a> (AI) while bypassing the messy flesh that characterises organic life.</p>



<p>I understand the appeal of this view, because I co-founded SwiftKey, a predictive-language software company that was bought by Microsoft. Our goal is to emulate the remarkable processes by which human beings can understand and manipulate language. We’ve made some decent progress: I was pretty proud of the elegant new communication system we built for the physicist Stephen Hawking between 2012 and 2014. But despite encouraging results, most of the time I’m reminded that we’re nowhere near achieving human-like AI. Why? Because the layered model of cognition is wrong. Most AI researchers are currently missing a central piece of the puzzle: embodiment.</p>



<p>Things took a wrong turn at the beginning of modern AI, back in the 1950s. Computer scientists decided to try to imitate conscious reasoning by building logical systems based on symbols. The method involves associating real-world entities with digital codes to create virtual models of the environment, which could then be projected back onto the world itself. For instance, using symbolic logic, you could instruct a machine to ‘learn’ that a cat is an animal by encoding a specific piece of knowledge using a mathematical formula such as ‘cat &gt; is &gt; animal’. Such formulae can be rolled up into more complex statements that allow the system to manipulate and test propositions – such as whether your average cat is as big as a horse, or likely to chase a mouse.</p>



<p>This method found some early success in simple contrived environments: in ‘SHRDLU’, a virtual world created by the computer scientist Terry Winograd at MIT between 1968-1970, users could talk to the computer in order to move around simple block shapes such as cones and balls. But symbolic logic proved hopelessly inadequate when faced with real-world problems, where fine-tuned symbols broke down in the face of ambiguous definitions and myriad shades of interpretation.</p>



<p>In later decades, as computing power grew, researchers switched to using statistics to extract patterns from massive quantities of data. These methods are often referred to as ‘machine learning’. Rather than trying to encode high-level knowledge and logical reasoning, machine learning employs a bottom-up approach in which algorithms discern relationships by repeating tasks, such as classifying the visual objects in images or transcribing recorded speech into text. Such a system might learn to identify images of cats, for example, by looking at millions of cat photos, or to make a connection between cats and mice based on the way they are referred to throughout large bodies of text. </p>



<p>Machine learning has produced many tremendous practical applications in recent years. We’ve built systems that surpass us at speech recognition, image processing and lip reading; that can beat us at chess, <em>Jeopardy!</em> and Go; and that are learning to create visual art, compose pop music and write their own software programs. To a degree, these self-teaching algorithms mimic what we know about the subconscious processes of organic brains. Machine-learning algorithms start with simple ‘features’ (individual letters or pixels, for instance) and combine them into more complex ‘categories’, taking into account the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity in real-world data. This is somewhat analogous to the visual cortex, which receives electrical signals from the eye and interprets them as identifiable patterns and objects.</p>



<p>But algorithms are a long way from being able to think like us. The biggest distinction lies in our evolved biology, and how that biology processes information. Humans are made up of trillions of eukaryotic cells, which first appeared in the fossil record around 2.5 billion years ago. A human cell is a remarkable piece of networked machinery that has about the same number of components as a modern jumbo jet – all of which arose out of a longstanding, embedded encounter with the natural world. In <em>Basin and Range</em> (1981), the writer John McPhee observed that, if you stand with your arms outstretched to represent the whole history of the Earth, complex organisms began evolving only at the far wrist, while ‘in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history’.</p>



<p>The traditional view of evolution suggests that our cellular complexity evolved from early eukaryotes via random genetic mutation and selection. But in 2005 the biologist James Shapiro at the University of Chicago outlined a radical new <a href="http://shapiro.bsd.uchicago.edu/Shapiro.2005.Gene.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">narrative</a>. He argued that eukaryotic cells work ‘intelligently’ to adapt a host organism to its environment by manipulating their own DNA in response to environmental stimuli. Recent microbiological findings lend weight to this idea. For example, mammals’ immune systems have the tendency to duplicate sequences of DNA in order to generate effective antibodies to attack disease, and we now know that at least 43 per cent of the human genome is made up of DNA that can be moved from one location to another, through a process of natural ‘genetic engineering’.</p>



<p>Now, it’s a bit of a leap to go from smart, self-organising cells to the brainy sort of intelligence that concerns us here. But the point is that long before we were conscious, thinking beings, our cells were reading data from the environment and working together to mould us into robust, self-sustaining agents. What we take as intelligence, then, is not simply about using symbols to represent the world as it objectively <em>is. </em>Rather, we only have the world as it is <em>revealed</em> to us, which is rooted in our evolved, embodied needs as an organism. Nature ‘has built the apparatus of rationality not just on top of the apparatus of biological regulation, but also <em>from</em> it and <em>with</em> it’, wrote the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio in <em>Descartes’ Error</em> (1994), his seminal book on cognition. In other words, we think with our whole body, not just with the brain.</p>



<p>I suspect that this basic imperative of bodily survival in an uncertain world is the basis of the flexibility and power of human intelligence. But few AI researchers have really embraced the implications of these insights. The motivating drive of most AI algorithms is to infer <em>patterns</em> from vast sets of training data – so it might require millions or even billions of individual cat photos to gain a high degree of accuracy in recognising cats. By contrast, thanks to our needs as an organism, human beings carry with them extraordinarily rich <em>models</em> of the body in its broader environment. We draw on experiences and expectations to <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predict likely outcomes</a> from a relatively small number of observed samples. So when a human thinks about a cat, she can probably picture the way it moves, hear the sound of purring, feel the impending scratch from an unsheathed claw. She has a rich store of sensory information at her disposal to understand the idea of a ‘cat’, and other related concepts that might help her interact with such a creature.</p>



<p>This means that when a human approaches a new problem, most of the hard work has already been done. In ways that we’re only just beginning to understand, our body and brain, from the cellular level upwards, have already built a model of the world that we can apply almost instantly to a wide array of challenges. But for an AI algorithm, the process begins from scratch each time. There is an active and important line of research, known as ‘inductive transfer’, focused on using prior machine-learned knowledge to inform new solutions. However, as things stand, it’s questionable whether this approach will be able to capture anything like the richness of our own bodily models.</p>



<p>On the same day that SwiftKey unveiled Hawking’s new communications system in 2014, he gave <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview to the BBC</a> in which he warned that intelligent machines could end mankind. You can imagine which story ended up dominating the headlines. I agree with Hawking that we should take the risks of rogue AI seriously. But I believe we’re still very far from needing to worry about anything approaching human intelligence – and we have little hope of achieving this goal unless we think carefully about how to give algorithms some kind of long-term, embodied relationship with their environment.</p>

August 6, 2020 | https://blog.space.storage/posts/Introducing-Space | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.space.storage/posts/Introducing-Space">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Space.png"></p>
<p>Today the Fleek team is super excited to announce a brand new product we’ve been working on for the past few months: Space!</p>
<p>Space is an open source file storage, sharing and collaboration platform built on the distributed web. You can think of V1 of Space as a private, encrypted, p2p version of dropbox or google drive, and you can use Space the same way that you would use those products. The big benefit of using Space over those other products is you don’t need to sacrifice your privacy and allow those companies to spy on you and control your files/data, because with Space everything is private, user owned, end-to-end encrypted, and peer-to-peer!</p>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/SpaceScreenshot3.png"></p>
<p>Starting today, Space is accepting beta signups. If you’re interested in getting early access to Space and participating in the beta, sign up <a href="https://space.storage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> and we will reach out in the coming weeks when it’s your turn. This first version of Space is a desktop app available on Mac, Windows, and Linux. We plan to release a mobile app and web app in the future as well once it’s feasible (discussed more below).</p>
<p>Below is some additional info on Space, why we built it, and the product roadmap/vision.</p>
<h2 id="the-internet-is-broken"><a href="#the-internet-is-broken" aria-label="the internet is broken permalink"></a>The Internet Is Broken</h2>
<p>And we need to fix it now. Content is becoming more and more censored, hacks are becoming more and more serious, and big tech companies and governments are spying on users, violating their privacy, and abusing their data more and more everyday. In the past few months alone there have been multiple platforms (<a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/07/02/redd-j02.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://fee.org/articles/youtube-to-ban-content-that-contradicts-who-on-covid-19-despite-the-un-agency-s-catastrophic-track-record-of-misinformation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Youtube</a>) and governments (<a href="https://apnews.com/9abc40bdd22f6c8df763bad0b4c55924" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/07/07/hong-kong-law-internet-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hong Kong</a>) increasing internet censorship, Twitter got <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53445090" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">badly hacked</a>, and a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/republicans-push-bill-requiring-tech-companies-to-help-access-encrypted-data/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bill was introduced</a> in the US that would force tech companies to unencrypt private data about users (if technically possible) and give it to the government. The trend is frightening, especially with things like personal health, genetic and brain data on the horizon, coupled with AI, we could be headed to a real dystopia if something isn’t done about this soon.</p>
<p>There’s only one possible way out of the current situation and to save the internet: distribute the web.</p>
<h2 id="distributing-the-web-is-our-only-way-out"><a href="#distributing-the-web-is-our-only-way-out" aria-label="distributing the web is our only way out permalink"></a>Distributing The Web Is Our Only Way Out</h2>
<p>All the issues with the current internet can be traced back to two main flaws: centralization &amp; lack of encryption. And so the only way to fix the internet is to fix those two flaws. But the gatekeepers that control the current internet (google, apple, facebook, amazon, etc.) built their tremendous fortunes, power, and infrastructure around those flaws, so they aren’t going to help fix them. But luckily there are people like Juan Benet and Vitalik in the world who are creating new open source technologies that can serve as the foundation for a new, improved distributed internet that address the two main flaws of the current internet and finally gives control, ownership, privacy, and freedom back to users. And after 5+ years of several groups building and working on these new technologies/protocols, we feel they are now mature enough and ready to be combined/used to create a real distributed web stack and start building products/apps that leverage distributed web technologies to offer privacy, data ownership, censorship resistance, peer-to-peer, and other benefits to users, while still maintaining pretty much the exact same user experience internet/app users are accustomed to.</p>
<h2 id="enter-space"><a href="#enter-space" aria-label="enter space permalink"></a>Enter Space</h2>
<p>Space is one of the first products fully built on the distributed web that provides a true Dweb (short for distributed web) experience to users. Space showcases the possibilities and benefits of the Dweb, which we hope encourages other developers to also build true Dweb sites &amp; apps (and we’re building tools to make that super easy to do!). For Space, we chose to start with a file storage, sharing, and collaboration app because we feel that the technologies that make up the Dweb Stack (discussed below) are ready to handle this use case, and file storage/sharing also serves as a great base/foundational building block that other apps can now leverage to more easily create other use cases, products and experiences on the Dweb. That is why in conjunction with the open source Space desktop app, a few weeks ago we also recently released the open source <a href="https://blog.fleek.co/posts/daemon-release" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Space Daemon</a>, which is essentially a standard interface that packages all the protocols in the Dweb stack into one easy to use daemon that can be shared across apps, so this way a user can just have one daemon on their machine that multiple Dweb apps can leverage. We already have several apps building on top of Space/Space Daemon and we highly encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">check it out</a>!</p>
<h2 id="what-underlying-technologies-power-spacespace-daemon-aka-the-dweb-stack"><a href="#what-underlying-technologies-power-spacespace-daemon-aka-the-dweb-stack" aria-label="what underlying technologies power spacespace daemon aka the dweb stack permalink"></a>What Underlying Technologies Power Space/Space Daemon (aka the ‘Dweb Stack’)?</h2>
<p>Space is/will be built on top of IPFS, Textile, Filecoin, Ceramic, and Handshake (and potentially other distributed web protocols in the future). This combination is what we consider the initial ‘Dweb Stack’ - a set of open source protocols that together can create a true Dweb experience that rivals the current internet. Similar to DeFi starting by creating a separate, stand-alone, adjacent financial system that is now starting to blend with the traditional financial system over time, we felt the best approach for the Dweb would be to start out and grow in a similar way.</p>
<p>Space the desktop app was built using the open source Space Daemon mentioned above, which makes it super easy to build Dweb apps that leverage any/all of the underlying protocols in the Daemon (IPFS, Textile, Ceramic, Filecoin, Handshake, etc.), and enables a true Web3/distributed web experience for users (on desktop to start, and on mobile and in browser in the near future). What this means is that everything on Space is encrypted by default, owned by the user, peer-to-peer, self-hosted (functions without reliance on centralized companies/middlemen), censorship resistant, and users have the option to remain completely anonymous (no email or personal info required to use Space, and you can even use crypto to pay for Space Pro plans to remain completely anonymous). We plan on potentially adding other protocols to the Daemon in the future, such as Ethereum or others. We encourage other developers to contribute to the open source daemon repo and give input on it’s roadmap. The Space app will also be open source and will be added to our repo once it officially launches.</p>
<h2 id="why-start-with-a-desktop-app"><a href="#why-start-with-a-desktop-app" aria-label="why start with a desktop app permalink"></a>Why Start With a Desktop App?</h2>
<p>This decision was based on the current state of the Dweb Stack and the protocols under the hood (IPFS, Textile, etc.). In order to create a true Dweb user experience, you need to have nodes for these different protocols running on the users machine. These nodes don’t function perfectly on mobile or in browsers at the moment, but in a desktop app they work great. A ton of awesome work is being done that will make it feasible to create mobile and web versions of Space (and other apps built on Space/Space Daemon) in the coming months while maintaining the full Dweb user experience.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-filesdata-stored-and-transferred-in-space"><a href="#how-are-filesdata-stored-and-transferred-in-space" aria-label="how are filesdata stored and transferred in space permalink"></a>How are Files/Data Stored and Transferred in Space?</h2>
<p>Files can be stored locally on your machine(s) and shared completely privately/anonymously/peer-to-peer with other Space users (you can also privately/anonymously share files with users outside of Space using private links with optional password protection). Users/Teams also have the option to store backup encrypted copies of their files in ‘Space’. For now these backup encrypted copies of your files are stored on remote Space nodes (that consist of an IPFS, Textile, Filecoin, Ceramic, and Handshake nodes) that we run around the world. However we can never access your files or the contents of them, only you (and the people you share files with) can unencrypt them with the keys on your machine(s). We also will add Filecoin as an additional backup/encrypted storage option for users shortly after launch, so users will be able to choose if/where they want to store encrypted backups of their files/data. Users will also have the option to run their own backup Space nodes if they want. And at some point in the near future we hope to decentralize/open up the backup storage function completely (potentially via a token).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-benefit-of-storing-backup-encrypted-copies-of-files-in-space"><a href="#what-is-the-benefit-of-storing-backup-encrypted-copies-of-files-in-space" aria-label="what is the benefit of storing backup encrypted copies of files in space permalink"></a>What is the Benefit of Storing Backup Encrypted Copies of Files In Space?</h2>
<p>Besides the privacy, encryption, p2p, censorship resistance, etc. benefits you get from using the Space app, the benefit of storing backup encrypted copies of your files/data in ‘Space’ (in addition to locally) is that you will have a backup/recovery mechanism in case you ever lose your device. Also in case someone you shared a file with is trying to access that file/data while you are offline, the file can still be served from ‘Space’ because those nodes are always online. Storing backup encrypted copies of your files in Space will be a paid feature, however it is completely optional to use, and you also have the option to pay for it in crypto if you choose to use it but prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The value prop of storing backup encrypted copies of your files in Space is similar to the value prop of cloud storage, except completely private, encrypted, anonymous, and nobody can access the content of your files/data besides you and the people you explicitly share/collaborate with. Plus Space is just cooler than ‘the Cloud’. Quite frankly, ‘the Cloud’ sucks: it isn’t private, it isn’t encrypted, it lets companies spy on you and abuse your data, it gets hacked all the time. Meanwhile Space doesn’t. Space &gt; Cloud, period. Storing in the Cloud is such a lame, boomer move. Don’t be lame. Take back control of your data and privacy. Store in Space.</p>

<p>Right now they are completely separate products. But in the future we plan on adding features to Fleek to make it super easy to deploy true Dweb sites &amp; build true Dweb apps on top of Space/Space Daemon (similar to how we make it easy today to deploy sites/apps directly to IPFS). So the plan is still for Fleek to become a Firebase type platform for building Dweb sites/apps. But Space will always remain a separate, fully open sourced project and product with an …</p></div></div>

  <div>
    <div id="content"><p>Django is currently the most commonly used full-stack web framework for Python. It has
been around for a good 15 years, emerging as a winner from a period in which
Python was already mature, but its web development tools were comparatively
much more immature and fragmented.</p>
<p>Django allows the definition of objects in your program as "models" using the
<tt>Model</tt> base class. They behave largely like normal Python classes, with
added support to save into, and retrieve from, the relational database backing
your application. If you don't need such database support, you didn't
need a full-stack web framework in first place.</p>
<p>Django tries to be independent from the database you choose. It sounds like
a good idea, but only on paper. After working several years
with Django systems, both written from scratch or inherited and maintained, I
feel the "blessed" way of working with databases and
Django leads you to using your database in a sub-optimal way, and unnecessarily complicates
the development and maintenance cycle of your project.</p>
<p>I think the divergence between wishful thinking and reality starts from a
fundamental misunderstanding between you and Django, which is not written in
the contract you haven't signed with them anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
"independence from the relational database" is a feature needed by Django
as a framework, <em>not by the program you are writing</em>.</blockquote>
<p>Django needs it because a web framework not tied to a single database vendor
is more valuable than one tied to a specific one - and that's fair enough. <em>But you
don't:</em> your web program, most likely than not, will not have to switch from
one database to another. So, <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">You Ain't Gonna Need It™</a>. Portability at all costs
leads to at least two problems:</p>
<p>1) You will not able to use all the features offered by your relational
database.</p>
<p>2) Every change to your models, or to your database schema, will be more
complicated than it should be.</p>
<div id="you-ain-t-gonna-need-it">
<h3>You Ain't Gonna Need It</h3>
<p>How many times have you worked on a project and, after 1-2 years of
development, you have changed to a different database?</p>
<p>I can tell you how many times it happened to me, I counted them: exactly
never.</p>
<p>Replacing your database vendor is a major, traumatic occurrence, almost as
much as rewriting your program in a different language. If you replace your
database, more likely than not, it is because you are interested in the
features of the new databas. You need to use them so using the common
functionalities between the old and the new one will not solve any of your
problems.</p>
<p>Did you maybe start your project with SQLite and now your project grew enough
to need a bigger database? If so then you are still at the phase in
which your project is a toy: you haven't done anything yet that requires
thinking in terms of concurrency. Even if you have to rewrite a few things,
it's not going to be a lot.</p>
<p>Do you have a large MySQL project and now you have to migrate to PostgreSQL?
That's not gonna happen: you have probably tweaked MySQL, have expertise in
MySQL. Maybe PostgreSQL might be a better database in some aspects, but not so much
that you want to migrate all your data and start from scratch without
<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/frobnicate.html">frobbing, twiddling, tweaking</a> the database configuration. Did you say
you have High Availability and Disaster Recovery configured? That's to be
converted too of course.</p>
<p>In the above paragraph, replace the database vendor with all the permutations
of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Oracle. <em>That's not gonna happen</em>. Except maybe
if an Oracle salesman gets hold of someone in your project with a modicum of
decision making and talks them into buying some sort of expensive license, but
that's not a technical problem, it's a political one, and it's up to you to
decide if you are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Have you got PostgreSQL in production, but you want to test with SQLite because
it's easier to set up? If so, your tests are just a tick-box exercise: you
are not testing anything remotely plausible and resembling your live system.</p>
<p>Choosing a database happens in the first days of your projects, it will not
happen when the project is mature. You may as well use all the features
available with your database, not only the ones common enough that Django
created a Python wrapper for it.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-all-the-features">
<h3>Use all the features</h3>
<p>Scanning the schema of a Django program I've written and maintained for a few
years I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schemas (as in the "directory of the tables", not all the other meanings)</li>
<li>Custom domains</li>
<li>Collations</li>
<li>Triggers</li>
<li>Permissions</li>
<li>Partial indexes</li>
<li>Constraint exclusions</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Stored procedures</li>
<li>Partitioned tables</li>
</ul>
<p>If these features were used, it's because they allowed to implement
certain features needed for the program in a simpler way than what possible in
the language (if even would have been possible there). Audit for
instance: Django doesn't have an audit feature except for the changes made in
the admin. Even if you added some form of manual auditing to each <tt>save()</tt>
method, it will not capture changes made outside Django. It wouldn't be very
secure either: Django uses a single user to access the database so if someone
manages to hijack that user, they would be able to change the data in the database
and alter the audit tables to hide their traces.</p>
<p>In PostgreSQL you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an "audit" user: it will have different permissions than the user of
the Django application.</li>
<li>Create an "audit" schema: revoking write permission to all the objects it
will contain from the Django user.</li>
<li>Create a function to append a record to an audit table owned by the "audit"
user, but callable by the Django user.</li>
<li>Add a trigger to the tables to audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup requires Postgres-specific knowledge, which is fair for a feature
that has to watch over the database data whichever the origin of the change
is. But being PostgreSQL extensible as it is, you can <a href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pgaudit">use an extension</a> to automate the creation and
maintenance of the audit triggers and functions.</p>
</div>
<div id="so-where-do-i-put-the-schema">
<h3>So where do I put the schema?</h3>
<p>Into an SQL file!</p>
<p>With its tiny <tt>.sql</tt> extension!</p>
<p>And with comments! Explaining why a certain index or constraint exist!</p>
<p>With constraints named meaningfully, available for manipulation, not
<tt>auth_group_permissions_group_id_b120cbf9_fk_auth_group_id</tt>.</p>
<p>Sounds civilised to me.</p>
<p>The nice thing of doing this is that, if you do things carefully enough, Django
will not notice anything at all.</p>
<p>Take the above audit examples: Django is not meant to interact with it:
everything will just happen under its nose. You can use views instead of
tables for read-only models, you can use domains instead of more basic data
types for your fields: Django won't see your triggers triggering, your
constraints constraining, your permissions permitting - except when things go
wrong, which will result in an error 500 and a Python traceback. This is at least
better than bad data in the database. Also it won't see your procedures
proceeding, your domains dominating...you get the idea.</p>
<p>Using psql to import the schema into an empty database means you can modularise the
code and use <tt>\i</tt> to import "submodules". A typical pattern for me is to have
a <tt>database.sql</tt> to create global objects (users, extensions, schemas),
set the basic permissions and import the details into target schemas.</p>

shouldn't contain any reference to the schema <tt>myapp</tt> where the objects are
created so the schama can be easily changed. Postgres doesn't have a statement like
<tt>CREATE USER ... IF NOT EXIST</tt>: in <tt>users.sql</tt> you can simulate it with:</p>

<h3>Migrations</h3>
<p>Django has an amazingly complex system to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/">perform model migrations</a>. It is
complex amongst other reasons because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It actually migrates <em>Python models</em> not <em>database schemas</em>. Even if you change a field's help
text, it generates a migration.</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Migration</span><span>(</span><span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span><span>):</span>

    <span>operations</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>migrations</span><span>.</span><span>AlterField</span><span>(</span>
            <span>model_name</span><span>=</span><span>'foo'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'bar'</span><span>,</span>
            <span>field</span><span>=</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>BooleanField</span><span>(</span><span>help_text</span><span>=</span><span>'I only changed this'</span><span>),</span>
        <span>),</span>
</pre>
<p>That's not useful at all for the database, but Django will create it for you
and if you remove it, it will add it back. Similarly, changing a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#choices">choices
list</a>, a display label, results in migrations with no database operation,
only a Python operation, and practically no SQL purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It allows access to the state of the model at times intermediate between
migrations, using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.get_models">get_model</a><tt>(appname, modelname)</tt> and with some
Python code in the returned model. But if that code also happens to use
any code inside your application, importing models with a normal Python
<tt>import</tt>, things will crash because of a mismatch between model
definitions and schema in the database. But they won't crash immediately: only
later when you will apply some unrelated migration. And not when that
migration is needed: only after it has already been applied and it doesn't
have anything more to do in its lifetime: it is implemented as a model that
Django will keep on importing over and over. In a …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the pandemic intensifying the plight of U.S. retailers, companies from J. Crew Group Inc. to the owner of Ann Taylor are using Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings to quickly get out of costly, long-term leases and shutter thousands of stores.</p>

<p>By seeking court protection, firms like Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and the parent company of Menâ€™s Wearhouse avoid the headache of protracted negotiations with individual landlords. But the moves threaten to upend huge swaths of the real estate market and the half-trillion dollar market for commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>â€œThis is now black-letter law -- a debtor can cram down a landlord,â€� said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge whoâ€™s now a partner at law firm Otterbourg PC. â€œIf this becomes a tsunami of retailers rejecting their leases, itâ€™s going to trigger another part of the sea change -- the mortgages held by the landlords.â€�</p>

<p>As bankrupt firms like J.C. Penney Co. and Brooks Brothers Group Inc. look to jettison leases, landlords are already feeling the consequences. CBL &amp; Associates Properties Inc., owner of more than 100 shopping centers in the U.S., is preparing its own bankruptcy&nbsp;filing&nbsp;after rent collections cratered. And 16 per cent&nbsp;of retail property loans bundled into CMBS were delinquent in July, according to research firm Trepp.</p>

<p><strong>Filing Surge</strong></p>

<p>At least 25 major retailers have filed for bankruptcy this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The most recent additions include Tailored Brands Inc., owner of Menâ€™s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank, which is seeking to&nbsp;close&nbsp;about a third of its more than 1,200 stores, and Lord &amp; Taylor parent company&nbsp;Le Tote, which said it could shut down all of the department storeâ€™s remaining locations.</p>

<p>â€œItâ€™s economical, itâ€™s efficient and it allows retailers to rationalize their footprint quickly,â€� said Fred Ringel, co-chair of the business finance and restructuring practice at the law firm Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese &amp; Gluck P.C. Ringel, who works for landlords, said heâ€™s busier than ever renegotiating leases and in some cases persuading tenants to forgo cancellations and stay under modified terms.</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="750" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1476348!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/a-pedestrian-wearing-a-protective-mask-walks-past-a-boarded-up-j-crew-group-inc-store-on-14th-street-in-washington-d-c-u-s-on-thursday-april-16-2020-on-wednesday-mayor-muriel-bowser-announced-an-extension-of-the-shutdown-of-nonessential-businesses-until-may-15-after-the-original-date-of-april-24.png" width="1296"></p>

<p>Take vitamin retailer GNC Holdings Inc. It operates hundreds of stores across the country, mostly in strip malls. Since filing for bankruptcy in June, GNC has asked to reject at least 500 leases, along with more than 50 franchise agreements and subleases, according to court records.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, CEC Entertainment Inc., the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese, is negotiating with its landlords after its June bankruptcy filing. It won court approval this week to defer rent payments as it evaluates which locations it wants to keep open.</p>

<p>And the U.S. unit of Spanish retailer Desigual said it was forced to file after struggling to get rent abatements from its landlords. â€œUnfortunately, DUSA had little success in getting landlords to realize the new reality that most tenants -- especially those in retail -- cannot afford to pay pre-COVID-19 rent,â€� a representative for the firm said in court papers.</p>

<p>Landlords, in turn, have their own mortgages to worry about, which were also underwritten with pre-pandemic assumptions about rent collections. Amid the stress, Barry Sternlichtâ€™s Starwood Capital Group&nbsp;missed&nbsp;payments on securitized debt linked to five shopping malls, and Saks owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. also&nbsp;skipped&nbsp;interest due on certain CMBS. Delinquencies on retail mortgages bundled into bonds climbed to 16 per cent&nbsp;in July, from 3.8 per cent&nbsp;in January, according to Trepp.</p>

<p><strong>Tenant Power</strong></p>

<p>Some retailers can work out rent abatements and other lease modifications including terminations without filing for bankruptcy. However, negotiating hundreds of deals outside of a court process can be challenging, especially for big retail chains that may have hundreds of landlords to deal with, said Navin Nagrani, an executive vice president at Hilco Real Estate.</p>

<p>Bankruptcy flips the power from landlords to tenants. Retailers can legally reject a swath of leases in court, sometimes leaving building owners to collect just pennies on the dollar. Firms can also sell off favorable contracts to other parties to help repay creditors.</p>

<p>â€œSometimes a bankruptcy is the most advantageous way to get out of those leases,â€� Nagrani said.</p>

<p>As many as 25,000 stores are expected to close in the U.S. in 2020, mostly in shopping malls, according to Coresight Research. Department stores and fashion boutiques are seen as the most endangered.</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="675" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1476623!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/mall-landlords-get-mauled.png" width="1200"></p>

<p>More than half of mall department stores could close for good by the end of 2021, according to an April report from real estate research firm Green Street&nbsp;Advisors. J.C. Penney said last month that it would&nbsp;shutter&nbsp;more than 150 locations, while Neiman Marcus plans to pull out of New Yorkâ€™s Hudson Yards development and&nbsp;close&nbsp;three other U.S. locations.</p>

<p>The closures so far are â€œjust the tip of the iceberg,â€� said&nbsp;Garrick Brown, head of Americas retail research for Cushman &amp; Wakefield. Over the next two years, at least 1.2 billion of square feet -- 10% of already-occupied store real estate -- will go vacant, he said. â€œWorst-case scenario, that could double.â€�</p>

<p><span>So, how to fix your slow landing page? Images may be the culprit. Very large or too many images are the most common reasons for slow page load time. One solution is always to resize and compress images to fit the layout of your landing page. One of our favorite image compression tools is: </span><a href="https://compressor.io/"><span>Compressor.io</span></a></p>
<p><span>Remember, conversion windows are pretty short, especially for first-time customers. Optimize your landing pages for speed to capitalize on the momentum you’ve gained.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><b>2. Mystery Call-to-Action</b></h3>
<p><b>Users should immediately know the action to take when they land on your website.</b><span> The Call-to-Action (CTA) should be clear. If users are hunting around trying to find where to click, you’ve lost opportunities. Look at this example from Ship Cars Now.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ship-Cars-Now.png" alt="The Ship Cars Now landing page has seven CTAs; wrong thing to do." width="602" height="333" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ship-Cars-Now.png 602w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ship-Cars-Now-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p>
<p><span>Image credit: </span><a href="https://www.autogrow.co/examples-of-horrible-landing-pages/"><span>AutoGrow</span></a></p>
<p><span>The Ship Cars Now landing page has seven CTAs. Someone who clicks on their site isn’t going to know where to begin. Having too many call-to-action buttons on the same page can be a distraction. Your landing page </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> have more than one CTA, but make sure you prioritize them not to confuse your main goal.</span></p>
<p><span>How do you know if your landing page’s CTA is effective? Do this quick test. Find someone who isn’t familiar with your company and show him or her your landing page. Would he/she be able to look at it and determine:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The purpose of the landing page?</span></li>
<li><span>The product or service you’re offering?</span></li>
<li><span>The next step to take?</span></li>
<li><span>How to take that next step?</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In addition to avoiding too many CTAs, you should avoid using too many text and font options on your CTA buttons (something else the above landing page fails to do). To unify the messages of a landing page, always use the same text for all call-to-action buttons. Different text in different CTA buttons will confuse your audience.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Cluttered Format </b></h3>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cruise-landing-page-1024x562.png" alt="Example of a cluttered landing page." width="604" height="332" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cruise-landing-page-1024x562.png 1024w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cruise-landing-page-300x165.png 300w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cruise-landing-page-768x422.png 768w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cruise-landing-page.png 1464w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></p>
<p><i><span>Image credit: </span></i><a href="https://www.justinmind.com/blog/the-7-worst-landing-pages-ever/"><i><span>Just in Mind</span></i></a></p>
<p><span>Take a look at the above landing page design and see if you can guess what’s wrong with it. If you thought ‘clutter,’ you would be right.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Too many boxes, multiple navigation patterns, and large, bold text all crammed onto the screen make for a poor viewing experience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Things to remember when designing a clutter-free landing page:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Remember, “Less is more.”&nbsp;</b>Show the user the most important aspects of your product and a way to read more details if he/she wants.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Use clever visuals (but not too many).</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Visuals can quickly convey messages, but too many can be a distraction and cause your users to ignore your call to action. Remove flashing advertising banners, floating boxes, pop-ups, or any other similar distractions is essential to increase the conversion rates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Limit your links/choices.</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Too many choices can confuse users and make them leave your website. Make navigating your website easy for users by keeping the number of options short. You don’t have to destroy the <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/architecture">link architecture</a> of your website to create an effective landing page. The links can remain on the page, but focus the attention on the choices that you want users to make.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Too many colors, fonts, text sizes, images, or buttons will muck things up and increase bounce rates, so ‘declutter’ your landing pages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Demanding Too Much Information</b></h3>
<p><span>Your landing pages may contain forms where the visitor has to fill out contact information to download or buy an item. If you ask for too much information, you can turn off potential clients. Try to request only the necessary contact information. When possible, eliminate the fields that are unnecessary since they are considered barriers by many users.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Too-much-info-form.png" alt="If you ask for too much information, you can turn off potential clients." width="467" height="590" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Too-much-info-form.png 583w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Too-much-info-form-237x300.png 237w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px"></p>
<p><i>Image credit: </i><a href="https://conversionfanatics.com/how-many-web-form-fields-is-too-many/"><i>Conversion Fanatics&nbsp;</i></a></p>
<p><span>The key is only asking what is needed at the moment. Think of your forms as a way of building customer profiles. For example, if a customer wants to download an ebook, maybe you would only need his/her name and email address. You can use this information later to ask more questions after the customer requests a demo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In other instances, only email and name forms aren’t going to cut it. You may want to ask more qualifying questions. Yes, you’d get fewer responses, but you’ll also get more qualified leads. Find the right balance to know when to request what information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Lack of Trust</b></h3>
<p><span>Low landing page conversion rates could be because customers do not yet trust your website. A well-designed landing page is the first step to building trust and shows customers that you are a serious company. Customers typically don’t trust outdated looking landing pages.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/outdated-landing-page.png" alt="Customers typically don’t trust outdated looking landing pages." width="602" height="392" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/outdated-landing-page.png 2636w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/outdated-landing-page-300x195.png 300w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/outdated-landing-page-768x500.png 768w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/outdated-landing-page-1024x667.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p>
<p><span>Image credit: </span><a href="https://todayslocalmedia.com/ugly-website-designs-examples/"><span>Today’s Local Media</span></a></p>
<p><b>Beyond a well-designed landing page, adding social proof like reviews and testimonials can go a long way into building trust with customers.</b><span> Add testimonials from your satisfied clients, reviews from credible companies you worked with, and positive feedback from experts in your industry to your sites. Also, include in a visible position any Trust Seals or Badges that show that your website is safe for online transactions.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Broken Links&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Having broken links is the quickest way to lose potential clients.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/404.png" alt="Having broken links is the quickest way to lose potential clients. " width="602" height="358" srcset="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/404.png 978w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/404-300x179.png 300w, https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/404-768x457.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px"></p>
<p><span>Imagine this message happening to people who visit your landing page. They’ll most likely click the back arrow, and you’ll lose out on a potential sale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And they probably won’t come back. </span><a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/ux-statistics/"><span>88% of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience.</span></a><span> That broken link not only drove customers away, but it also damaged your business reputation.</span></p>

Ensure that every CTA works, every form submission submits correctly, and every download leads to the promised result.</span></p>
<h3><b>7. Not Tracking Your Landing Page&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>You cannot optimize your landing page without first knowing how well it performs currently. Not monitoring and tracking the landing pages’ results&nbsp;</span><span>is a major mistake that, unfortunately, a lot of business owners make.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Invest time to review your traffic reports, trace user website behavior, and clicks by using </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events"><span>Google Analytics Event Tracking</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/pages"><span>Google Virtual Pageviews</span></a><span>. This information is critical to start evaluating and optimizing the results of each landing page.</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Not Testing Your Landing Page</b></h3>
<p><span>You should be testing more than one version of your landing page. If you don’t test different versions of your site, you can’t be sure what’s working or how well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A/B testing gives you lots of useful data about the behavior and needs of your customer. Use the information you gather from A/B testing to improve your pages and make the right marketing decisions. You can easily perform A/B testing using </span><a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/"><span>Google’s Website Optimizer</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>9. Not Optimizing Your Landing Page&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Redesign landing pages by taking into account the results that you track, the A/B testing, and the feedback from your users to improve conversion rates. </span><b>Don’t forget that your customers should “design” your website and not your Web Designer.</b></p>
<p><span>Remember, your customer’s values are your company’s values. Your landing page should reflect what your customer finds useful. Since different clients have different needs, you need to find a solution that satisfies most of them. You can find out what the majority of your customer values through testing.</span></p>
<p><span>Landing page optimization can be challenging. Optimizing your site requires you to present the information optimally. To understand your clients’ needs, monitor your landing pages’ performance closely, and invest time and effort on improving results and experimenting with new approaches.</span></p>
<h3><b>10. Not Being Optimized for Mobile</b></h3>
<p><span>Did you know that </span><a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics#post-navigation-0"><span>people browse the internet on their mobile devices more than on desktops?</span></a><span> Internet browsing on phones is so popular that Google </span><a href="https://webservices.marketpath.com/digital-marketing-insights/google-to-penalize-non-mobile-sites-starting-in-april"><span>penalizes </span></a><span>websites that aren’t mobile-friendly.</span></p>

<p><span>How does your website look on mobile? A quick way to see is through the </span><a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly"><span>Google Mobile-Friendly Test</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are four critical tips for designing for mobile:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Keep headlines to 5 words or less.</span></li>
<li><span>Don’t forget to include your company logo.</span></li>
<li><span>Use simplicity and whitespace in your design.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep the form simple and the call to action button prominent.</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Wrapping Up</span></h2>
<p><span>You can have the best offer in the world, but people won’t convert if they don’t stay on your landing page long enough.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Conversion-killing landing page mistakes include:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Slow loading times</span></li>
<li><span>Unclear call-to-action</span></li>
<li><span>Cluttered format</span></li>
<li><span>Demanding too much information</span></li>
<li><span>Lack of trust</span></li>
<li><span>Broken links&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Failing to track, test, or optimize your landing page.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Not being mobile-ready</span></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Fixing these typical landing page mistakes will boost your campaign’s performance and save you money. So make sure you’re not guilty of these all too common mistakes!</span></p>

        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>My brain is kind of funny. When I see "free" money in some newfangled service backed by venture capitalists, I try to scheme a way that would make that free money mine. All of these schemes while potentially fruitful, are typically way to much work to be worth it, but I love coming up with them.</p>
<h3 id="just-this-week--">Just this week -</h3>
<p>I came up with a scheme on how to gross $120 each week from my newest "gambling" obsession <a href="https://withyotta.page.link/Mky6HvgTUtmhDkqb6">Yotta Savings</a> (click it, sign up, and get 100 free "lottery" tickets), it is a new (to the US) type of savings account <strong>that is FDIC insured</strong>, called a reward backed savings account. It's basically a traditional savings account, but on top of the 0.2% interest the account would normally pay out, each week you pick (or have it pick) numbers for a weekly lottery drawing, and they add your winnings to your account. </p>
<h3 id="that-is-enough-free-advertising-let-me-continue">That is enough free advertising, let me continue.</h3>
<p>I was reading their official rules, and it seems that you can get up to 10,000 tickets each week either by</p>
<ul>
<li>For every $25 in your account (up to $250k) entitles you to 1 ticket.</li>
<li>For every single handwritten sheet of paper with your name, phone, email, address, and optionally your numbers. <em>Limit 1 request per envelope. Automation is prohibited.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>That sent me on a downward spiral toward finding the game to that second "free" ticket rule.</p>
<h3 id="as-with-all-projects-try-the-naive-approach-first">As with all projects, try the naive approach first</h3>
<p>Mailing a single sheet of paper in an #10 envelope with a stamp. This approach would cost around $0.60. A forever stamp is now $0.50, an envelope is around $0.10 and a sheet of paper is about a penny.</p>
<p>10,000 requests would cost $6,000. Depending on the odds, that might be worth it.</p>
<p>Some quick (probably kind of wrong) math it looks like statistically 10,000 tickets should gross an average of $120 each week.</p>
<p>It was plain to see, as with most naive approaches, this would not work.</p>
<p>Now knowing that I have to make 10,000 requests to statistically average $120 each week, I need to get the cost per request down to $0.012.</p>
<h3 id="break-even--0012request">Break even = $0.012/request</h3>
<p>Now my brain started turning. Delivery is the biggest expense. How can I get that cost down? </p>
<p>The address to deliver the requests is in NYC, and I could just drive the requests down. I only live 40 miles north of the city. If I nursed the throttle, I would use about $5 in gas, with careful planning, tolls would cost around $6, and parking COULD be free on the street.</p>
<h3 id="remaining--00109request">Remaining = $0.0109/request</h3>
<p>Next biggest expense was material costs. How can I get all this paper I needed cheaper? A ream of paper is 500 sheets and costs about $11 on amazon, a 10 ream box costs about $50, (awesome! half the price per ream), but there is a weird 8 ream box that costs only $30 or about 1/3 the cost per ream. <strong>Sold!</strong> I have 4000 sheets of paper at less than a penny a sheet, but now I need envelopes. </p>
<h3 id="envelopes-are-expensive">Envelopes are EXPENSIVE.</h3>
<p>For just a folded piece of paper with a little glue on it, I wouldn't have thought they would cost so much, but I was WRONG. I actually couldn't find an envelope for less than $0.05, and that was buying 5000 envelopes at a time.</p>
<p>So buying envelopes are out of the question. I was about to throw in the towel when Engineer brain kicked back in. Make the damn envelopes your self. But it was painfully obvious that with 1 sheet of paper costing $0.0075, I wouldn't break even if I used 2 sheets of paper per request, and then it clicked.</p>
<h3 id="tiny-requests">Tiny requests!</h3>
<p>Why can't I just make the request smaller. What is a "sheet of paper" anyway???</p>
<p>So I pull out my little paper cutter, grab a sheet of paper and decided randomly to make the tiny sheets of paper 3 inches by 2 inches. I had no reasoning behind it, it just seemed correct. What is crazy about 3x2, is you actually get 14 tiny pages out of it with one 2x2 square left over, and only a tiny bit of waste. An envelope has to be slightly bigger than 1Wx2H the tiny sheet of paper to fully envelop the contents, so I made it 3.5 inches wide and 4.25 inches long.</p>
<p>A tiny sheet of paper costs $0.0005, and a tiny envelop costs $0.00125, for a total materials and shipping cost of $0.00285.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-glue-that-shuts-the-envelopes">What about the glue that shuts the envelopes!?</h3>
<p>Oh my, you are correct. This one was much more complex to figure out. I would need to tape these requests shut on 3 sides if folded like an actual envelope. Alas, I thought of this. And with some not so difficult "origami" you can make the envelop close with only a single piece of tape or dot of glue. Bulk clear office tape can be had for only $10 for 11,000 inches of tape. Used sparingly (1/2 inch per envelope, it will only add $0.00045 to the cost of the request.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-penspencilsink">What about pens/pencils/ink???</h3>
<p>According to the research at The University of Reading, the average ballpoint pen will ink 900 meters, or roughly 61,000 characters, now BIC claims their cheap crystal ballpoint pens last 2.5 kilometers, or 170,000 characters per pen. So if I were to use their pens, and their claim is genuine, I would run through 5 pens over the 10,000 requests. And a pack of 10 pens is around $5, so that would add another $0.00025 per request.</p>
<h3 id="these-numbers-just-keep-climbing">These numbers just keep climbing</h3>
<p>Probably all in, you are looking at a cost of $0.00355 per request, or $35.50 each week to earn an average of $120. Oh, and about 50 hours of cutting, folding, taping, writing really tiny, handcramps, and frustration.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</h3>
<p>The exercise in figuring something like this out is worth it, actually executing this plan is totally NOT worth it.</p>
<p>And that tends to always be the case with my brain, it realizes something else that is not going to work, but instead of giving up, I dive into more research, and soon enough an entire day has passed me by and all I have to show for it is a paper cut, and a pile of confetti on my desk.</p>

<p>That functional programming opposes object-oriented programming in some fundamental way is a widely-held programming cliche. We list features like immutability, functions and composition in contrast to mutability, classes and inheritance. We tout Clojure and Haskel as functional languages on one end of the spectrum and C++ and Java as object-oriented languages on the other. Articulating the makeup of the spectrum is another story altogether however. None of this trivia reveals why certain features are seen together or apart, why languages themselves may skew in one direction or another, or any inherent differences in program semantics. Nevertheless, the “functions vs. objects” cliche is an artifact of a profound truth about program structures and semantics. Like up and down and oil and water, functional and object-oriented programming indeed cannot coexist. We may choose objects or functions, but not both at once, as advertised. Moreover, the choice between paradigms has dramatic implications for program semantics, offering competing “world-views” involving concepts as basic as identity, change, state and time. Object-oriented programs produce “distinct objects whose behaviors may <em>change over time</em>.” By contrast, functional programs involve state transitions between <em>discrete</em> <em>moments in time</em> that can be seen together as “streams of information that flow in the system.” — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> (SICP), Section 3</p>

<p>Many of the insights underlying this post can be found in original form in the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs </a> (SICP). There you will find a life-altering discussion of the same topics using Scheme, a Lisp dialect like Clojure. All code examples included in this post, however, will be couched in terms of JavaScript, even if borrowed. If you know JavaScript and are unfamiliar with Scheme, this post may be immediately accessible to you without first learning how “<a href="https://crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html">to balance all those parens</a>.” Little is lost in translation as well. JavaScript has first-class functions (i.e. lambdas), closures (i.e. function-delimited lexical scoping) and generally thrives when used functionally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript’s functions are first class objects with (mostly) lexical scoping. JavaScript is the first lambda language to go mainstream. Deep down, JavaScript has more in common with Lisp and Scheme than with Java. It is Lisp in C’s clothing. — Douglas Crockford, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-good/9780596517748/ch01s02.html">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is even an ongoing <a href="https://sicp.comp.nus.edu.sg/">academic effort</a> to translate the full text of SICP into JavaScript. Also considered, JavaScript is a close cousin of TypeScript, which enables traditional object-oriented constructs like <code>private</code> and <code>public</code> and functional constructs like <code>readonly</code> and <code>as const</code> at compile time. Perhaps in JavaScript (and TypeScript), we get enough support of functional and object-oriented programming paradigms to enable a discussion of both within a single, ubiquitous language.</p>
<h2 id="object-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming <a href="#object-oriented-programming">#</a></h2>
<p><em>Object-oriented programming</em> has come to signify a common language for modeling the behavior of objects.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> <em>Methods</em> leverage privileged access to proscribe the ways in which private attributes may be viewed or changed. A <em>class</em> specifies the blueprint for creating object instances of a certain kind. Together, these constructs may create computational objects that simulate real objects. This <code>bankAccount</code> object in TypeScript, for example,</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BankAccount</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>private</span> balance<span>;</span><p>  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>funds</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance <span>=</span> funds<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span></p><p>  <span>public</span> <span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance <span>-</span> amount<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span></p><p>  <span>public</span> <span>checkBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>balance<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>const</span> bankAccount <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BankAccount</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>checkBalance</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<figcaption>This example is based on the "withdraw" procedure introduced in SICP Section 3.1.</figcaption>
<p>stores balance data in a private attribute and exposes privileged methods <code>checkBalance</code> and <code>withdraw</code>, which proscribe the manner in which access to <code>balance</code> can occur. Together, these constructs create a computational object  <code>bankAccount</code> that behaves like a “bank account”, carrying a balance that may be diminished through “withdraw” and viewed through “check balance” actions. Less abstract objects can be modeled with the same set of tools. An <code>apple</code> may have a <code>bite</code> method that reduces an internal <code>bites</code> state in order to model an “apple” and a <code>house</code> may have a <code>paint</code> method that changes an internal <code>color</code> state in order to model a “house.” More abstract objects can be modeled with the same set of tools as well. A <code>userMetaData</code> object may have a <code>setEmail</code> method that updates an internal <code>email</code> state in order to model “user meta data.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And a key characteristic here is that objects have methods… They are operationally defined. And we use them to provide a layer of abstraction over the places that our program uses. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Private state enforces the object abstraction together with privileged, public methods. Expose <code>balance</code> directly (i.e. make it public), for example, and it can “magically” change from say <code>100</code> to <code>10</code> despite no <code>withdraw</code>al ever having occurred.</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BankAccount</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>public</span> balance<span>;</span><br>  <span>...</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>const</span> bankAccount <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BankAccount</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>bankAccount<span>.</span>balance <span>=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<figcaption>Did a withdrawal occur? Does <code>bankAccount</code> accurately represent a "bank account"?</figcaption>
<p>Expose <code>color</code> directly and it can magically change from say <code>WHITE</code> to <code>BLUE</code> despite no <code>paint</code>ing ever having occurred. In other words, object-oriented programming provides the means for identifying objects (<code>bankAccount</code>) and associated behaviors (<code>withdraw</code>)</p>
<pre><code>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>in place of imperative, direct manipulation of variables (<code>balance</code>) ad hoc.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span><br>balance <span>=</span> balance <span>-</span> <span>20</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<figcaption>Did a withdrawal occur? Does <code>balance</code> represent a "bank account" or something else entirely?</figcaption>
<p>Coincidentally, the private data / public methods dynamic also provides the means for data encapsulation. That data is stored in private attributes, accessible only through privileged methods, proscribes the ways in which such data may be viewed or changed. The <code>balance</code> data of <code>bankAccount</code> can only be changed by <code>withdraw</code> or read by <code>checkBalance</code>, in one sense, because it may not be accessed directly.</p>
<h3 id="place-oriented-programming">Place-Oriented Programming <a href="#place-oriented-programming">#</a></h3>
<p>Nevertheless, object-oriented and imperative programming share a fundamental orientation towards places in memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But mutable objects are actually abstractions of places. They do not actually have meaning other than that. They are little barricades we have set up in front of memory, so that we do not have to directly manipulate memory addresses any more. So we have this abstraction that is an object, that helps us manipulate that place without too much craziness…So I have a new label for this. It is called PLOP, and PLOP is place-oriented programming. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/ValueOfValuesLong.md">The Value of Values</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A method call to <code>withdraw</code> effectively overwrites a <code>balance</code> reference</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> bankAccount <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BankAccount</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br>bankAccount<span>.</span><span>withdraw</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>just as any direct assignment that circumvents a method.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> balance <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span><br>balance <span>=</span> balance <span>-</span> <span>20</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>A mutable variable underlies the reassignment in both cases, whether or not an object method mediates such reassignment, and a place in memory underlies every mutable variable.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming <a href="#functional-programming">#</a></h2>
<p>Procedures that produce the same result when provided the same argument can be viewed as computing mathematical functions. For example, a <code>decrement100</code> procedure in JavaScript,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>decrement100</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> <span>100</span> <span>-</span> x<span>;</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><p><span>decrement100</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>or, more succinctly,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>decrement100</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>100</span> <span>-</span> x<span>;</span><p><span>decrement100</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>can be viewed as computing the mathematical function <code>f(x) = 100 — x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f(20) = 80; where f(x) = 100 - x</code></pre>
<p>since the return value of <code>decrement100</code> depends only on the input value just as <code>f(x)</code> depends only on <code>x</code>. Invoke <code>decrement100</code> a second time with <code>20</code> and it will return <code>80</code> once again, regardless of time and place within a program’s runtime. By contrast, an alternative implementation</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> oneHundred <span>=</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> <span>decrementOneHundred</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> oneHundred <span>-</span> x<span>;</span><p><span>decrementOneHundred</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <br>oneHundred <span>=</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span><br><span>decrementOneHundred</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<p>involving a mutable binding does not model computing a mathematical function, since its behavior may depend on variable information in addition to its input. Invoke <code>decrementOneHundred</code> a second time with <code>20</code> and it will <em>not</em> return <code>80</code> once again when such binding is intermediately reassigned.</p>
<p>Functional procedures are not limited to numbers. Procedures that involve character strings, for example,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>space</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>w1<span>,</span> w2</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>w1<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>w2<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span><p><span>space</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>,</span> <span>"world"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<figcaption><code>“hello world”</code> will result from <code>("hello", "world")</code> regardless of program context.</figcaption>
<p>a list of strings,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>space</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>w1<span>,</span> w2</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>w1<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>w2<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> <span>sentence</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>words</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>words<span>.</span><span>reduce</span><span>(</span>space<span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>.</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span><p><span>sentence</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>"i"</span><span>,</span> <span>"heart"</span><span>,</span> <span>"functions"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>
<figcaption><code>"i heart functions"</code> will result from <code>["i", "heart", "functions"]</code> regardless of program context.</figcaption>
<p>or other arbitrary data types and compositions may return the same value provided the same argument. Larger functional procedures can be composed of smaller ones,</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>square</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x <span>*</span> x<span>;</span><br><span>const</span> <span>sum</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x<span>,</span> y</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x <span>+</span> y<span>;</span><p><span>const</span> <span>sumOfSquares</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>x<span>,</span> y<span>,</span> z</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>square</span><span>(</span>x<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span>y<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span>z<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>sumOfSquares</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </p></code></pre>

  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

August 6, 2020 | https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-2-6-updates | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-2-6-updates">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>On behalf of the Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> community, it is my pleasure to announce the release of <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Kafka 2.6.0</a>. This another exciting release with many new features and improvements. We’ll highlight some of the more prominent features in this blog post, but see the <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/kafka/2.6.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release notes</a> for the full list of changes.</p>
<p>We’ve made quite a few significant performance improvements in this release, particularly when the broker has larger partition counts. Broker shutdown performance is <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly improved</a>, and performance is dramatically improved when producers use compression. Various aspects of ACL usage are faster and require less memory. And we’ve reduced memory allocations in several other places within the broker.</p>
<p>This release also adds support for Java 14. And over the past few releases, the community has switched to using Scala 2.13 by default and now recommends using Scala 2.13 for production.</p>
<p>Finally, these accomplishments are only one part of a larger active roadmap in the run up to Apache Kafka 3.0, which may be one of the most significant releases in the project’s history. The work to <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replace ZooKeeper</a> with built-in Raft-based consensus is well underway with eight KIPs in active development. Kafka’s new Raft protocol for the metadata quorum is already <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available for review</a>. Tiered Storage unlocks infinite scaling and faster rebalance times via <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-405</a> and is up and running in internal clusters at Uber.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-broker-producer-and-consumer"><a id="kafka-broker-producer-and-consumer"></a>Kafka broker, producer, and consumer</h2>
<h3 id="kip-546"><a id="kip-546"></a>KIP-546: Add Client Quota APIs to the Admin Client</h3>
<p>Managing quotas today in Kafka can be challenging because they can map to any combination of user and client. This feature adds a native API for managing quotas, making the process more intuitive and less error prone. A new <code>kafka-client-quotas.sh</code> command line tool lets users describe existing quotas, resolve the effective quotas for an entity with contextual information about how those quotas were derived, and modify a quota configuration entry by specifying which entries to add, update, and/or remove. For example:</p>
<pre>$ /bin/kafka-client-quotas.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
						 --alter --names=client-id=my-client \
						 --defaults=user \
                              --add=consumer_byte_rate=2000000 \
                              --delete=producer_byte_rate</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-546%3A+Add+Client+Quota+APIs+to+the+Admin+Client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-546</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-551"><a id="KIP-551"></a>KIP-551: Expose disk read and write metrics</h3>
<p>Disk access on the Kafka broker machines may impact latency and throughput. This change adds metrics that track how many bytes Kafka is reading and writing from the disk.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-551%3A+Expose+disk+read+and+write+metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-551</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-568"><a id="KIP-568"></a>KIP-568: Explicit rebalance triggering on the Consumer</h3>
<p>The Kafka consumer coordinates which topic partitions are assigned to each client in the same consumer group. This feature allows applications using the consumer to explicitly trigger a rebalance, such as if an application uses some system condition to determine whether it is ready to receive partitions.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-568%3A+Explicit+rebalance+triggering+on+the+Consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-568</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-573"><a id="KIP-573"></a>KIP-573: Enable TLSv1.3 by default</h3>
<p>TLS 1.3 is now the default TLS protocol when using Java 11 or higher, and TLS 1.2 remains the default for earlier Java versions. As with Apache Kafka 2.5.0, TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled by default due to known security vulnerabilities, though users can still enable them if required.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-573%3A+Enable+TLSv1.3+by+default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-573</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-574"><a id="KIP-574"></a>KIP-574: CLI Dynamic Configuration with file input</h3>
<p>Kafka configs for the most part are defined by a single value that maps to a config name. Before this change, it was hard to set configs that are better defined by more complex structures such as nested lists or JSON. Kafka now supports using the<code> kafka-configs.sh</code> command line tool to set configs defined in a file. For example:</p>
<pre>$ bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
                       --entity-type brokers --entity-default \
                       --alter --add-config-file new.properties</pre>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-574%3A+CLI+Dynamic+Configuration+with+file+input" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-574</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-602"><a id="KIP-602"></a>KIP-602: Change default value for <code>client.dns.lookup</code></h3>
<p>Apache Kafka 2.1.0 and <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-302+-+Enable+Kafka+clients+to+use+all+DNS+resolved+IP+addresses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-302</a> introduced the <code>use_all_dns_ips</code> option for the <code>client.dns.lookup</code> client property. With this change, the <code>use_all_dns_ips</code> option is now the default so that it will attempt to connect to the broker using all of the possible IP addresses of a hostname. The new default will reduce connection failure rates and is more important in cloud and containerized environments where a single hostname may resolve to multiple IP addresses.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-602%3A+Change+default+value+for+client.dns.lookup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-602</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-connect"><a id="kafka-connect"></a>Kafka Connect</h2>
<h3 id="kip-158"><a id="kip-158"></a>KIP-158: Kafka Connect should allow source connectors to set topic-specific settings for new topics</h3>
<p>This widely requested feature allows Kafka Connect to automatically create Kafka topics for source connectors that write records, if those topics do not yet exist. This is enabled by default but does require connector configurations to define the rules used by Connect when creating these topics. For example, simply including the following will cause Connect to create any missing topics with <code>5</code> partitions and a replication factor of <code>3</code>:</p>
<pre>topic.creation.default.replication.factor=3
topic.creation.default.partitions=5</pre>
<p>Additional rules with topic matching expressions and topic-specific settings can be defined, making this a powerful and useful feature, especially when Kafka brokers have disabled topic auto creation.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-158%3A+Kafka+Connect+should+allow+source+connectors+to+set+topic-specific+settings+for+new+topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-158</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-605"><a id="KIP-605"></a>KIP-605: Expand Connect Worker Internal Topic Settings</h3>
<p>Speaking of creating topics, the Connect worker configuration can now specify additional topic settings, including using the Kafka broker defaults for partition count and replication factor, for the internal topics used for connector configurations, offsets, and status.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-605%3A+Expand+Connect+Worker+Internal+Topic+Settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-605</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-610"><a id="KIP-610"></a>KIP-610: Error Reporting in Sink Connectors</h3>
<p>Kafka Connect already had the ability to write records to a dead letter queue (DLQ) topic if those records could not be serialized or deserialized, or when a Single Message Transform (SMT) failed. Now Connect gives sink connectors the ability to send individual records to the DLQ if the connector deems the records to be invalid or problematic. Sink connectors need to explicitly make use of this feature, but doing so will allow sink connectors to continue operating even if some records in the consumed topics are somehow incompatible with the sink connector.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-610%3A+Error+Reporting+in+Sink+Connectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-610</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-585"><a id="KIP-585"></a>KIP-585: Filter and Conditional SMTs</h3>
<p>Defining SMTs for connectors that use multiple topics can be challenging, since not every SMT may apply for every record on every topic. With this feature, each SMT can define a predicate with the conditions when that SMT should be applied. It also defines a “filter” SMT that works with the predicates to drop records that match certain conditions.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-585%3A+Filter+and+Conditional+SMTs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-585</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-577"><a id="KIP-577"></a>KIP-577: Allow HTTP Response Headers to be Configured for Kafka Connect</h3>
<p>It is now possible to add custom headers to all Kafka Connect REST API responses. This allows users to ensure REST API responses comply with corporate security policies.</p>
<p>See<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP+577%3A+Allow+HTTP+Response+Headers+to+be+Configured+for+Kafka+Connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> KIP-577</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-streams"><a id="kafka-streams"></a>Kafka Streams</h2>
<h3 id="KIP-441"><a id="KIP-441"></a>KIP-441: Smooth Scaling Out of Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>Prior to this change, when Kafka Streams assigns a stateful task, Streams had to catch it up to the head of its changelog before beginning to process it. This feature avoids stop-the-world rebalances by allowing the prior owner of a stateful task to keep it even if the assignment is unbalanced, until the new owner gets caught up, then changing ownership after the catch-up phase.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-441%3A+Smooth+Scaling+Out+for+Kafka+Streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-441</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-444"><a id="KIP-444"></a>KIP-444: Augment metrics for Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>This feature adds more out-of-the-box metrics and removes some that are not useful. It also improves the APIs that Streams applications use to register custom metrics.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-444%3A+Augment+metrics+for+Kafka+Streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-444</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-447"><a id="KIP-447"></a>KIP-447: Producer scalability for exactly once semantics</h3>
<p>This release adds additional work on this KIP to simplify the API for applications that read from and write to Kafka transactionally. Previously, this use case typically required separate producer instances for each input partition, but now there is no special requirement. This makes it much easier to build exactly-once semantics (EOS) applications that consume large numbers of partitions. This is foundational for a similar improvement in Kafka Streams in the next release.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-447%3A+Producer+scalability+for+exactly+once+semantics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-447</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="KIP-557"><a id="KIP-557"></a>KIP-557: Add emit on change support for Kafka Streams</h3>
<p>This change adds an emit-on-change processing option to Kafka Streams and complements the existing emit-on-update and emit-on-window-close options. This new option drops idempotent updates where the prior and updated record have identical byte arrays. This feature helps eliminate high numbers of identical operations that forward an enormous number of unnecessary results down the topology.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-557%3A+Add+emit+on+change+support+for+Kafka+Streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-557</a> for more details.</p>

            <p>We'll be guiding you through a crash course on satellites - their history, where in (well, around) the world they are, and how they send and receive data. Accompanying this guide (though not strictly required for it) is a set of equipment we've used ourselves to get everything going.</p>

            <p>If you have the means, we recommend buying the equipment yourself. If you don't, we've put together a kit that we'll send to you for a very reasonable price, though supplies are limited. The list of parts is below, or you can <a href="https://shoppe.redballoonsecurity.com/products/nyansat-kit">click here</a> to request a kit. We also have stickers and T-shirts <a href="https://shoppe.redballoonsecurity.com/collections/nyansat">here</a>. If you don't want a kit right now, you can continue on to the <a href="https://nyan-sat.com/chapter1.html">next section</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board.jpg"><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board.jpg"></a>
            <span>Antenny v1</span></p>

            <p>For the kit, we custom-built a PCB in our kit that integrates multiple parts, allowing you to connect everything together on a single board with no wiring. This board is the hardware component of the RBS Antenny project. It combines the EPS32 (with Bluetooth and Wifi support), a 16 channel PWM driver, and a motor driver with a maximum output of maximum 27W at 6V. The RBS Antenny board can easily handle the movement control of NyanSat antenna gimbal, and you can load your own custom code to adjust it however you like. The onboard reserved I2C channel connectors allow you to extend the basic NyanSat setup with an RBS custom made IMU module, OLED screen and GPS module.</p>

            <p>The RBS Antenny board is designed using Altium Designer and Assembled by an in-house pick and place machine in Manhattan, New York. After DEF CON, you can even repurpose the board for your future projects requiring microcontrollers and motor drivers. You can read more about it <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/antenny/">here</a>.</p>

            

            <p>After completing the Antenny v1 board, we found ways to enhance the board and designed the Antenny v2 which fixes bugs, improves functionality and reliability, and is now adaptable for future development on hardware.</p>

            <p><a href="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board2.jpg"><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/pcbh_board2.jpg"></a>
            <span>Antenny v2</span></p><p>The main improvements to highlight from the Antenny v1 to the Antenny v2 are as follows.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Reduced PCB size by 40%</li>
                <li>Breakout unused GPIO pins from ESP32 for future development</li>
                <li>Fixed I2C GPIO pull up bugs</li>
                <li>Enhanced power output of servo motor driver by 25%</li>
                <li>Added BeiDou/GPS (beitian bn-880) module connector pinout on PCB board</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For more information on Antenny v2 and general setup, please review <a href="https://github.com/RedBalloonShenanigans/antenny/blob/master/hardware/Antenny_board_hardware_setup_guide.pdf">this document</a> for pinouts and hardware requirements.</p>
            
            
            <p>These are covered in more detail in Chapter 4. Feel free to skip ahead. Not every part here is strictly required - feel free to only get the ones that interest you.</p>

            <h2>Pan/Tilt Gimbal</h2>
            <p><img src="https://nyan-sat.com/assets/gimbal.jpg"></p><p>This is a small gimbal we're using for pointing an antenna in a specific direction and track a satellite across the sky. They can be found multiple places. We have spare ones that we're selling at cost. Without one of these you can listen to geosynchronous satellites, but low orbit satellites will be whizzing across your antenna’s pickup area in seconds.</p>

According to <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share">a recent poll by the Cato Institute</a>, a third of Americans say that they are personally worried about losing their jobs or missing out on career opportunities if they express their real political opinions. Americans in all walks of life have been publicly shamed, pressured into ritualistic apologies or summarily fired.</p><p>But critics of the critics of cancel culture make a powerful retort. Accusing others of canceling can, they claim, be a way to stigmatize legitimate criticism. As Hannah Giorgis <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">writes in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/harpers-letter-free-speech/614080/">Atlantic</a></em>, “critical tweets are not censorship.”</p><p>So what, exactly, does a cancellation consist of? And how does it differ from the exercise of free speech and robust critical debate? </p><p>At a conceptual level, the difference is clear. Criticism marshals evidence and arguments in a rational effort to persuade. Canceling, by contrast, seeks to organize and manipulate the social or media environment in order to isolate, deplatform or intimidate ideological opponents. It is about shaping the information battlefield, not seeking truth; and its intent—or at least its predictable outcome—is to coerce conformity and reduce the scope for forms of criticism that are not sanctioned by the prevailing consensus of some local majority.</p><p>In practice, however, telling canceling apart from criticism can be difficult because both take the <em>form</em> of criticizing others. That is why it is probably impossible to devise a simple bright-line test of what should count as a harmful instance of cancelation.</p><p>A better approach might therefore be diagnostic. Like the symptoms of cancer, the hallmarks of a cancellation are many. Though not all instances involve every single characteristic, they all involve <em>some </em>of its key attributes. Rather than issuing a single litmus test, the diagnostic approach allows us to draw up a checklist of warning signs. The more signs you see, the more certain you can be that you are looking at a cancel campaign.</p><p>Six warning signs make up my personal checklist for cancel culture. </p><p><strong>Punitiveness</strong></p><p><em>Are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups or your social connections? Are you being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities? Does what is being said to or about you have the goal—or foreseeable effect—of jeopardizing your livelihood or isolating you socially?</em></p><p>A critical culture seeks to correct rather than punish. In science, the penalty for being wrong is not that you lose your job or your friends. Normally, the only penalty is that you lose the argument. Even the phenomenon of retracting papers is new and deservedly controversial, because the usual—and very effective—method has been for science to simply discard mistakes and move on. Wrong answers and bad science die on the vine and disappear. Incentives are mostly positive, not punitive: for being right, you win citations, promotions, fame and fancy prizes. Taking a punitive attitude toward mistakes undermines the scientific process because knowledge advances by trial and error.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to punish rather than correct—and often for a single misstep rather than a long track record of failure. A professor <a href="https://spectator.us/academics-get-paper-retracted-some-havent-read-nathan-cofnas/">swears</a> to “ruin [a graduate student’s] reputation permanently and deservedly.” Campaigners against an art curator <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/gary-garrels-departure-sfmoma-1893964">declare</a> he “must be removed from his job, effective immediately.”</p><p>The point is to make the errant suffer. </p><p><strong>Deplatforming</strong></p><p><em>Are campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing your work, giving speeches or attending meetings? Are they claiming that allowing you to be heard is violence against them or makes them unsafe?</em></p><p>A critical culture tolerates dissent rather than silencing it. It understands that dissent can seem obnoxious, harmful, hateful and, yes, <em>unsafe</em>. To minimize unnecessary damage, it goes to great lengths to encourage people to express themselves in a civil manner. But it also understands that, every so often, an obnoxious dissenter is right—and so it opposes silencing and deplatforming.</p><p>Canceling, by contrast, seeks to shut up and shout down its targets. Cancelers often define the mere act of disagreeing with them as a threat to their safety or even an act of violence. Staffers at the <em>New York Times </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/07/business/media/new-york-times-washington-post-protests.html">claimed</a> that the mere act of publishing a controversial op-ed piece endangered them. Staffers at the <em>New Yorker</em> demanded that Steve Bannon be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/opinion/bannon-new-yorker-festival-remnick.html">deplatformed</a>. Shout-downs, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYkNS36ILrAhVUYDUKHWcADuIQFjAAegQIARAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefire.org%2Fresearch%2Fdisinvitation-database%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ONE1G9KXx27R20K-ezA56">disinvitations</a> and demands for retractions and withdrawals are cancelers’ stock in trade.</p><p><strong>Organization</strong></p><p><em>Does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Are the organizers recruiting others to pile on? Are you being swarmed and brigaded? Are people hunting through your work and scouring social media to find ammunition to use against you?</em></p><p>Critical culture relies on persuasion. The way to win an argument is to convince others that you are right. Often, of course, schools of thought form, and arguments between them can grow heated; but organizing pressure campaigns against political or ideological targets is usually considered out of bounds.</p><p>By contrast, it’s common to see cancelers organize hundreds of petition-signers or thousands of social media users to dig up and prosecute an indictment. Recently, for example, campaigners picked through the social media posts of the psychologist (and member of <em>Persuasion</em>’s Board of Advisers) Steven Pinker in the hope of digging up some kind of case against him. Though they only came up with <a href="https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2020/07/05/the-purity-posse-pursues-pinker/">trivial charges</a>, such as that he had twice used the terms “urban crime” and “urban violence,” they got hundreds of signatories to join a group denunciation.</p><p><strong>Secondary Boycotts</strong></p><p><em>Is there an explicit or implicit threat that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you are receiving? Are people putting pressure on employers and professional colleagues to fire you or stop associating with you? Do people who defend you, or criticize the campaign against you, have to fear adverse consequences?</em></p><p>With its commitments to exploring a wide range of ideas and correcting rather than coercing the errant, a critical culture sees no value in instilling a climate of fear. But instilling fear is what canceling is all about. By choosing targets unpredictably (almost anything can trigger a campaign), providing no safe harbors (even conformists can get hit), and implicitly threatening anyone who sides with those who are targeted, canceling sends the message: “you could be next.”</p><p>Thus, a canceled journalist was quickly dropped by his employer, his professional association and his publisher, becoming “<a href="https://reason.com/2019/08/23/im-radioactive/">radioactive</a>,” as he put it. (At last check, he was applying to law schools.) In the resulting climate, people will often join public denunciations or <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/stand-up-for-the-wrongly-accused-341">refrain from defending targets they believe to be innocent</a>, to avoid becoming controversial themselves.</p><p><strong>Moral Grandstanding</strong></p><p><em>Is the tone of the discourse ad hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged? Are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one-upmanship? Are people ignoring what you actually say—talking about but not to you? </em></p><p>Precisely because speech can be hurtful, critical culture discourages extreme rhetoric. It encourages people to listen to each other, to use evidence and argumentation, to behave reasonably and to avoid personal attacks.</p><p>Cancel culture is much more invested in what philosophers Justin Tosi and Brandon Warmke call “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/grandstanding-9780190900151?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">moral grandstanding</a>”: the display of moral outrage to impress one’s peer group, dominate others, or both. Grandstanders who condemn someone are not interested in persuading or correcting her; in fact, they are not really talking <em>to</em> her at all. Rather, they are using her as a convenient object in a campaign to elevate their own status. Pile-ons, personal attacks and bidding wars to show the most outrage are all ways of engaging in moral grandstanding.</p><p><strong>Truthiness</strong></p><p><em>Are the things being said about you inaccurate? Do the people saying them not even seem to care about their veracity? Do they feel at liberty to distort your words, ignore corrections and make false accusations?</em></p><p>Concern for accuracy is the north star of a critical culture. Not everyone gets every fact right, nor do people always agree on what is true; and yet people in a critical culture try to present their own and others’ viewpoints honestly and accurately. Though I may fail to live up to this standard in some cases, I recognize that I should address what you actually said, not an inflammatory caricature or some out-of-context quotation.</p><p>One of many reasons Donald Trump is a menace to democracy is that he views truth instrumentally, as something to use, abuse or ignore depending on the needs of the moment. He repeats discredited assertions <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/10/meet-bottomless-pinocchio-new-rating-false-claim-repeated-over-over-again/">again and again</a>—or shifts ground <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-says-it-doesnt-really-matter-if-iranian-general-posed-an-imminent-threat/2020/01/13/c9f7ea1c-362e-11ea-9541-9107303481a4_story.html">to another</a> when one assertion is definitively debunked. Cancelers often play the same kind of <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/rhetorical-calvinball">rhetorical Calvinball</a>.</p><p>Cancelers’ characterizations of a paper by the philosopher Rebecca Tuvel, for example, were <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html">demonstrably incorrect</a>. The person who initiated the campaign even admitted to <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.org/2017/can-we-get-this-person-fired/">not having read</a> the supposedly objectionable paper. “So little of what has been said … is based upon people actually reading what I wrote,” Tuvel <a href="http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/">lamented</a> in a public statement. </p><p>But that did not stop anybody. For canceling is not about seeking truth or persuading others; it is a form of information warfare, in which <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/63ite2/the-colbert-report-the-word---truthiness">truthiness</a> suffices if it serves the cause.</p><p>Those are my six warning signs. If you spot one or two, you should fear that a canceling may be happening; if you see five or six, you can be sure.</p><p>Obviously, mine is not the only approach. Other people, such as <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/a-taxonomy-of-fear">Emily Yoffe</a> and <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/04/whats-the-best-way-to-protect-free-speech-ken-white-and-greg-lukianoff-debate-cancel-culture/">Greg Lukianoff</a>, have made their own attempts at characterizing the current climate of fear or defining cancel culture. Hopefully, many more suggestions and refinements will follow. </p><p>As with most other concepts, we might never come to a complete consensus about its best definition. Still, I predict …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">United Airlines </a>is now cleaning pilot flight decks with Ultraviolet C (UVC) lighting technology on most aircraft at its hub airports to disinfect the flight deck interior and continue providing pilots with a sanitary work environment. The airline is using handheld, AUVCo blades from the American Ultraviolet company to kill any viruses that may reside on sensitive switches and touch screen displays within the flight deck.</p>



<p><a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-08-06-united-now-cleaning-flight-decks-with-uvc-lighting-2646907920.html" target="_blank" aria-label="United (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">United</a> has tested a variety of uses for UVC lighting as a disinfectant and consulted with its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2878045-1&amp;h=3468103102&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.united.com%2Fual%2Fen%2Fus%2Ffly%2Ftravel%2Fwhat-to-expect.html&amp;a=United+CleanPlus">United CleanPlus</a>&nbsp;partners at the Cleveland Clinic to determine that the flight deck was the most effective use of the technology.</p>

<p>“Safety is our highest priority and we continue to research, test and roll out new technologies to keep our aircraft and terminals safe for both customers and crew,” said Bryan Quigley, United’s senior vice president of flight operations. “Flight decks have many working parts, screens and components that are challenging to clean with traditional hand wipes and liquids, especially for someone who isn’t a pilot. The UVC lighting gives us a faster, more effective disinfection of one of the most important areas of the aircraft.”</p>



<p>United Airlines currently uses electrostatic spraying to disinfect its aircraft cabins, one of the most effective techniques to clean around harder to reach surfaces, particularly overhead bins and spaces within tray tables. United’s use of UVC lighting in the flight deck – along with electrostatic spraying in the cabin – further reflects the airline’s approach of matching the right type of technology to the right settings.</p>



<p>This latest enhancement of using UVC lighting technology is another way United Airlines is working with its partners at the Cleveland Clinic to guide its policies and procedures on safety and cleanliness.</p>



<p>“United Airlines implementing UVC lighting in its flight decks is an important tactic because we know that the virus can be killed by ultraviolet light,” said Dr. James Merlino, Chief Clinical Transformation Officer at Cleveland Clinic. “It’s one more measure that we can implement to ensure that we’re doing all we can to keep passengers, flight attendants and crews safer.”</p>

<p>United Airlines is focused on delivering a new level of cleanliness on the ground and in the air. In addition to the initiatives mentioned above, several of the airline’s precautionary measures to further ensure a cleaner environment include:</p>



<p><strong>At Check-In</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>A roadmap for a storage engine for Materialize</h2>

<p>As my final task as an engineer at Cockroach Labs, I wrote a blog post titled “<a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/cockroachdb-on-rocksd/">Why we built CockroachDB on top of RocksDB</a>”, where I discussed the extensive reasons that RocksDB was a good choice for CockroachDB’s storage engine at the time. So I suppose it was inevitable that I’d end up explaining why we chose a different approach for building state management in Materialize.</p>
<p>Materialize does not use RocksDB as its underlying storage engine. However, several other streaming frameworks do, such as Flink and Kafka Streams/KSQL (but not all: Spark Streaming uses the same Resilient Distributed Datasets storage layer as Spark, as it’s essentially Spark run in a micro-batched fashion). Given my past positive experience using RocksDB as a storage engine for an OLTP database, and <em>given that RocksDB is the default choice for state manager in streaming systems, why did we choose not to use it in Materialize</em>?</p>
<h3>A RocksDB Primer</h3>
<p>RocksDB is an embeddable storage engine that uses a log-structured merge tree of immutable flat files as the underlying index data structure. RocksDB maintains this indexed representation to efficiently perform point lookups, inserts, and range scans. RocksDB also provides support for strong isolation guarantees when performing those operations, and does so at high performance when there are multiple concurrent readers and writers accessing the same state, all while continuing LSM compaction in additional background threads.</p>
<p>This is an excellent storage engine to base OLTP workloads on top of, which is why several systems with primarily OLTP considerations all build on top of RocksDB: such as <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/">YugabyteDB</a>, and <a href="https://tikv.org/">TiKV</a> (and TiDB). Stream processors have followed this trend: <a href="http://flink.apache.org/">Flink</a>, <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/">Kafka Streams</a>, and others. Why do we not repeat this (tried and tested) experience, thus saving valuable engineering time? My position is that while RocksDB is a great OLTP storage engine, it is not a great fit for <em>streaming</em>.</p>
<h3>The Timely Dataflow Computational Model</h3>
<h4>Timely Dataflow: Sharding and Scheduling</h4>
<p>Before we talk about this, we have to spend a little bit of time on <a href="http://timelydataflow.com/">Timely Dataflow</a>, the streaming engine at the heart of Materialize. Timely Dataflow is a radically different framework than other stream processing frameworks like Flink and Kafka Streams in its physical computational model. I describe these differences a bit in a talk I gave at Carnegie Mellon University (video and transcript <a href="https://materialize.io/blog-cmudb/">here</a>), but for a quick overview, there are a couple design choices that are relevant when it comes to persistent storage. While all the streaming engines mentioned are push-based dataflow engines (as opposed to a pull-based <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/69.273032">Volcano</a> execution model used by several databases), there is a major design difference in the sharding pattern of the dataflow graph across distributed CPU cores.</p>
<p>A streaming dataflow graph is a set of operator nodes (intuitively, the familiar relational nodes like “join”, “reduce”, “map”, etc.), with streaming updates moving along the edges of the graph. When taking this logical dataflow graph and instantiating a physical set of operators, there comes an important decision in how to lay the operators out (and the inter-operator streams) across the available physical resources (the CPU cores, possibly across several machines).</p>
<p>Both Flink and Kafka Streams choose to divide work up by dedicating physical CPU cores to operators (the pink divider lines are separators between CPU cores, which are labeled “workers”), and sharding streams across a cluster of cores. If some logical operators require more CPUs, they can be replicated across several cores (e.g. the “count” operator in the graph below). This means that every edge flows between cores (and potentially between machines). This results in a large amount of cross-core data movement, at high cost even in the common case. These stream processors are thus severely memory bandwidth bound.</p>

<p>Flink and Kafka Streams use a core (or several) dedicated to each operator. In contrast, timely dataflow cores are sharded differently, intentionally to minimize cross-core data movement:</p>
<div id="attachment_1699"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1699" src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png" data-src="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png" alt="This diagram shows Timely Dataflow's sharding pattern" width="800" height="466" data-srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png 910w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-300x175.png 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-768x447.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM.png 910w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-300x175.png 300w, https://materialize.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-06-at-8.00.01-AM-768x447.png 768w"></p><p id="caption-attachment-1699">Figure 2: The Timely Dataflow operator sharding pattern.</p></div>
<p>Each core in a Timely Dataflow cluster has a complete copy of the logical dataflow plan, and every operator is partitioned across every core. In this sharding scheme, operators on a worker are cooperatively scheduled, and have to be carefully designed to yield eagerly, or they will block other operators from executing, potentially stalling the entire dataflow graph. While this is an additional programming burden, the benefits here are that when data does not have to be exchanged, operators can execute in a fused fashion, calling in directly into the next function, with little expensive data movement. While this is not the entirety of the reason for timely dataflow’s <a href="http://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2013/papers/p439-murray.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/hotos15/hotos15-paper-mcsherry.pdf">performance</a> <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-02-04.md">records</a>, this attentiveness to core-local data locality means that timely dataflow elides cross-core data transfer and the cache eviction that comes along with it in many common cases. And empirically, paying careful attention to the memory hierarchy <a href="https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/07/06/concurrency-costs.html">matters</a> when building high performance concurrent systems.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem with RocksDB: RocksDB is designed for liberally using <em>background threads</em> to perform the computation for physical compaction. In an OLTP setting, this is exactly what you want – lots of concurrent writers pushing to the higher levels of the LSM tree, lots of readers accessing immutable SSTables of the entire tree with snapshot isolation semantics, and compaction proceeding in the background with additional cores. In a streaming setting, however, those cores are better used as additional concurrency units for the dataflow execution, which means compaction happens in the foreground. And thus, scheduling <em>when</em> the compaction happens cannot be outsourced, and must be considered alongside all other operators.</p>
<h4>Differential Dataflow: Arrangements and Index Maintenance</h4>
<p>Timely Dataflow provides the scheduling and execution layer for operators, but <a href="http://differentialdataflow.com/"><em>Differential Dataflow</em></a> is the library on top of Timely that has careful implementations of common relational operators. Some of these operators need to maintain large amounts of state – for instance, a JOIN on two input streams will need to maintain indexes over both streams, keyed on the join condition, to quickly do lookups.</p>
<p>This is where many other stream processors use a RocksDB instance to maintain these indexes, which would deploy its own cores as background threads in order to perform physical <a href="https://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2017/01/10/lsm-tree-with-level-based-compaction/">compaction</a>. The work in maintaining an index is predominantly in the computation, not in the storage. RocksDB fits well in the paradigm where it can be viewed as another operator (“state manager”) sitting alongside the traditional relational operators (“join”, “group by”, and so on). While we have not measured the computation overhead in isolation, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/hotstorage20_paper_kalavri.pdf">a research paper</a> by Kalavri and Liagouris claims that while many stream processors use RocksDB, they “question the suitability of such general-purpose stores for streaming workloads and argue that they incur unnecessary overheads in exchange for state management capabilities”.</p>
<p>RocksDB is also optimized for the OLTP setting out-of-the-box, where reads typically outnumber writes 10:1. In the streaming setting, however, the read:write ratio is closer to 1:1, making the default compaction algorithms a poor fit. While in principle, this is fixable by writing a custom compaction algorithm optimized for streaming (I wrote <a href="https://ristret.com/s/gnd4yr/brief_history_log_structured_merge_trees">a brief history of RocksDB</a> on my personal blog a few years back, where I outline that compaction algorithms can largely tune LSM Trees for any read/write setting), none of the stream processors we are aware of go to this effort.</p>
<p>Differential Dataflow takes a different approach to building and maintaining indexes, with a custom LSM-like operator called arrange. Arrange takes immutable batches as inputs (just like RocksDB) and compacts them. The difference is that arrange is sharded by worker and cooperatively scheduled like any other timely dataflow operator, at the cost of being non-durable. The details of arrangements are covered in an upcoming <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/malte/pub/drafts/2019-kpg.pdf">VLDB paper</a>, but carefully controlling when compactions happen is a key part of maintaining consistent low latencies in streaming updates, while also maintaining a compact memory footprint.</p>
<h2>What about persistence?</h2>
<p>Arrangements are an in-memory data structure. Because each worker maintains its own dedicated memory space, it gracefully spills to disk via system paging, so it is not limited to the available RAM. However, upon system crash or restart, all this state is lost.</p>
<p>Note, however, that index maintenance and persisting streams are (subtly) orthogonal concerns! While using RocksDB as a durable index store can provide persistence, the high performance cost of using RocksDB and incurring cross-core data movement for every datum means that this is far from a free lunch. Second, there’s also considerable work in lining up the state across all the operators precisely to facilitate recovery! To do this, for instance, Flink uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandy%E2%80%93Lamport_algorithm">Chandy-Lamport</a> global synchronization algorithm, incurring latency spikes when checkpointing periodically runs (<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/ops/state/checkpoints.html#unaligned-checkpoints">a new feature</a> removes this latency, but is currently not consistent). Kafka Streams <a href="https://www.jesse-anderson.com/2019/10/why-i-recommend-my-clients-not-use-ksql-and-kafka-streams/">does not</a> do checkpointing, meaning that state largely must be thrown away and recreated upon restart, or the details of reusing state is left as an “easy exercise for the microservice programmer”.</p>
<p>Our view is that if index building and maintenance is fast enough, checkpointing the indexes becomes a less important concern. Just rebuild the index on restart! This reduces persistence to the challenge of storing the raw streams, rather than storing the complex globally distributed snapshot of state, a much easier problem. Just writing down the streams to append-only files, …</p></div></div>

Although we had completed only 3 months of development the community support was both incredible and humbling.</p><p><img src="https://supabase.io/img/supabase-hn-launch.png" alt="This image shows all of the top dev tool launches on Hacker news.

Let's dig into some of the features of the Auth system.</p><p>Supabase Auth provides all the backend services you need to authenticate and authorize your users.</p><h3>User management</h3><p>Supabase makes it simple to onboard your users with our new <code>supabase.auth.signup()</code> and <code>supabase.auth.login()</code> <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/library/user-management">functions</a>.</p><video width="99%" autoplay="autoplay" loop="" muted="" controls=""><source src="https://supabase.io/videos/auth-zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h3>Row Level Security</h3><p>Authentication only gets you so far.

We spent many weeks building Auth POC's with existing OSS tools. Notable mentions go to RedHat's <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeyCloak</a>, and Ory's <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kratos</a>. </p><p>Ultimately we landed on a system which utilises three amazing open source products: </p><ul><li>Authorization: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/auth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgREST</a>.</li><li>Authentication: Netlify's <a href="https://github.com/netlify/gotrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoTrue</a> server, which we forked and will continue to contribute to.</li></ul><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Supabase has a culture of shipping early and often. Our Auth release is another example of this, and we still have a lot of work to do. Next month we have more Auth features planned, including custom email templates and 3rd-party OAuth providers. We also plan to simplify the Policy interface, enabling non-technical users to get started with one of PostgreSQL's best features.</p><h3>Get started</h3><p>Supabase Auth is ready for you to start using today, free of charge: <a href="https://app.supabase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">app.supabase.io</a></p><p>To see the full power of our auth system, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/2oqIZW5S-lQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this demo</a> where I deploy a secure, real-time slack clone to Vercel in less than 3 minutes.</p></section></div>]]>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Simon’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a contrived problem which is called Simon’s problem. Compared to one of the other quantum computing algorithms, <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>, which only requires to run once, Simon’s algorithm requires to run the algorithm multiple times, yet it is still able to solve Simon’s problem exponentially faster asymptotically running on quantum circuits than the best conventional probabilistic algorithm running on classical circuits.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Simon’s problem and Simon’s algorithm in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="xor-properties">XOR Properties</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Commutativity</em>: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$</li>
  <li><em>Associativity</em>: $A \oplus (B \oplus C) = (A \oplus B) \oplus C$</li>
  <li><em>Identity element</em>: $A \oplus 0 = A$</li>
  <li><em>Self-invertible</em>:  $A \oplus A = 0$</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $x$ and $y$ are binary values, $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(-1)^{x + y} &amp;= (-1)^{x \oplus y} \\
(-1)^{x - y} &amp;= (-1)^{x \oplus y} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2). This could be easily verified using truth table.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-and-inner-product-space-for-binary-vector-space">Inner Product and Inner Product Space for Binary Vector Space</h4>

<p>In the previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">blog post</a>, we have defined the inner product and inner product space for complex vector space. Similarly, we could also define the inner product and inner product space for binary vector space.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle -, - \rangle : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Given two binary vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$, $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{n-1}\}$ and $\mathbf{y} = \{y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{n-1}\}$, the inner product of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle &amp;= (x_0 \wedge y_0) \oplus (x_1 \wedge y_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus (x_{n-1} \wedge y_{n-1}) \\
&amp;= \bigoplus_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i \wedge y_i )
\end{align}\]

</p><p>which is somewhat similar to the inner product definition for real vector space.</p>



<p>The bitwise exclusive-or operation $\oplus$ was also defined for binary vectors $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ of the same length.

<p>Most of the important properties of Hadamard operator have been derived in the prerequisites section of my previous blog post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. Unlike Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon’s algorithm is only going to use a small fraction of the Hadamard operator properties that Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm has used. I would just copy the properties useful for Simon’s algorithm algorithm. For the derivation, proof, and other properties of Hadamard operator, the reader should refer to my previous blog post.</p>



<p>To extract an arbitrary column $j$ from $H^{\otimes {n}}$, we prepared a one-hot quantum system basic state vector $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [y_0, y_1, \cdots, y_{2^n-1}]^{\top}$, where $y_j = 1$ and $y_k = 0$ for $k \neq j$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}}_{:,j} &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_0 \rangle + H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_1 \rangle + \cdots + H^{\otimes n}[\mathbf{2^n-1}, \mathbf{j}] | \mathbf{x}_{2^{n}-1} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{0}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_0 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_1 \rangle + \cdots + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{2^n-1}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_{2^{n}-1} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x}_i \rangle\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{j} \rangle} | \mathbf{x} \rangle\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } (-1)^{\langle \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \rangle} | \mathbf{x} \rangle\\

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{x}_i \rangle$ is a quantum system one-hot basic state vector,  $|\mathbf{x}_i\rangle = [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_{2^{n}-1}]^{\top}$, where $x_i = 1$ and $x_k = 0$ for $k \neq i$.</p>



<p>Specifically, if $j = 0$, $| \mathbf{y} \rangle = [\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \cdots, 0}_{2^n} ]^{\top} = | \mathbf{0} \rangle$,</p><p>

&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="simons-problem">Simon’s Problem</h3>

<p>Simon’s problem is defined as the follows. Given a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, we are further assured that there exists a hidden binary string $\mathbf{c} \in \{0,1\}^n$, such that, for all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$,</p><p>

\[f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}\]

</p><p>where $\oplus$ is (bit-wise) $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>



<p>Our goal is to find out what $\mathbf{c}$ is.</p>

<h4 id="mapping-properties">Mapping Properties</h4>

<p>There are some properties of the mapping $f$. $f$ is either a one-to-one or two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a one-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a one-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$ and $f$ is not a one-to-one mapping, there must exists $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{x}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a one-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>$\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>For $f$ is a two-to-one mapping $\Rightarrow$ $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, it is too trivial to prove.</p>



<p>For $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ $\Rightarrow$ $f$ is a two-to-one mapping, we would like to prove by contradiction.</p>



<p>If $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$, for any $\mathbf{x}$, we must have $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$ and $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$, $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$. So $f$ is at least a two-to-one mapping. Assuming there exists a tuple of $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$, $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{x}$, and $\mathbf{z} \neq \mathbf{y}$, and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y}) = f(\mathbf{z})$. According to the assurance, $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c}$. But $\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{y}$ so we have $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{y}$. This raises contradiction and therefore $f$ has to be a two-to-one mapping when $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="trivial-solution">Trivial Solution</h4>

<p>Solving Simon’s problem could be trivial.</p>



<p>If we happen to know any $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} \neq \mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y}$. This is because,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{y} &amp;= \mathbf{x} \oplus ( \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{c} ) \\
&amp;= ( \mathbf{x} \oplus \mathbf{x} ) \oplus \mathbf{c} \\
&amp;= \mathbf{0} \oplus \mathbf{c} \\
&amp;= \mathbf{c} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If we have checked all $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n$ and found there are no $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$, where $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{y}$ and $f(\mathbf{x}) = f(\mathbf{y})$, we immediately know $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{0}$.</p>



<p>So the trivial solution for solving Simon’s problem is to evaluate $f$ using the values in $\{0,1\}^n$ one by one, and check if the newly …</p></div></div>

<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

Site Reliability Engineering is the defining movement in tech today. Giants like Google and Amazon market their ability to provide reliable service and startups are now investing in reliability as an early priority.<br></p><p>But what makes reliability engineering so important? In this blog, we’ll look at three big benefits of investing in reliability and explain how you can get started on your journey to reliability excellence.</p><h3>Reliability engineering provides business value</h3><p>A reliable service is more valuable to a customer than one with inconsistent performance. It seems so obvious that you may think it goes without saying, but this reminder is crucial. Picture a typical user of your service. They are happy and engaged as they use your unique features, but don’t ignore the underlying assumption: your service works. Regardless of how your features stack up to competitors, users will always choose a functional option over a function-rich one. No feature is more important than reliability.<br></p><blockquote>Regardless of how your features stack up to competitors, users will always choose a functional option over a function-rich one. No feature is more important than reliability.</blockquote><p>The consequences of unreliable software are also more costly than the proactive investment in reliability. Consider how dependent you are on technology. On a given day, you rely on an alarm to wake you up, an app to report the weather, and a calendar that reminds you of your schedule. You might hail a ride from Uber or use Google Maps to avoid traffic on the freeway. Maybe you get lunch delivered from Grubhub. When you arrive home, your Amazon package is right where you expect it. We trust in these services.. When they go down, we feel angry.<br></p><p>These are the standards your service is judged by in the era of reliability. When the most popular software boasts uptime percentages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#Percentage_calculation">five nines</a>, users begin to expect a level of consistency where downtime is a non-concern. The value generated by investing in reliability isn’t just in the additional uptime of your service, but in keeping your customers happy with your brand, increasing users, and lowering the potential for churn.</p><h3>Reliability engineering empowers development</h3><p>You may think of reliability engineering as an overhead cost to development, an additional layer of work that must be accounted for. It’s true that time and energy must be dedicated to reliability, but you’ll find that adopting SRE best practices can actually empower and accelerate development.</p><h4>SLOs and error budgets</h4><p><a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/service-level-objectives-slos-lessons-learned">SLOs and error budgeting</a> work as a system to ensure downtime, latency, and other indicators of unreliability are kept within acceptable bounds. When these acceptable metrics are exceeded, SLO policies can refocus development efforts to stabilize and repair. On the other hand, when SLOs are within acceptable ranges and error budget is available, development can safely accelerate. Proposed changes that may affect reliability can be measured against the SLO, allowing you to build new features with confidence.<br></p><p>SLOs can also empower effective development by highlighting areas of greatest business impact. <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/slis-understand-users-needs">When determining your SLIs</a> (the indicators your SLOs measure) you’ll discover insights on what areas of your service matter most to users. When you understand exactly what your users expect, you understand how your service is positioned and how to develop towards customer happiness.</p><h4>Incident retrospectives</h4><p>Despite proactive measures, incidents are inevitable. However, with SRE principles, what would otherwise be considered a setback can become another investment in development. An <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/5-best-practices-nailing-postmortems">incident retrospective</a> is a document collaboratively constructed in response to an incident and reviewed by those involved afterwards. This may seem at first like additional work in a situation where time is already limited, but the time it saves more than makes up for it. By analyzing patterns in incidents, developers learn where to spend proactive efforts in reliability. It also encourages developers to look at ways to avoid common classes of bugs and incentivizes writing more performant code.<br></p><blockquote>Despite proactive measures, incidents are inevitable. However, with SRE principles, what would otherwise be considered a setback can become another investment in development. </blockquote><h4>Automation and consistency</h4><p>SRE principles also accelerate development through their focus on automation and consistency. By making the investment to codify DevOps processes in <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/runbook-automation-best-practices">runbooks</a>, where steps and checks are clearly outlined, common tasks can be made faster or even automatic. SRE encourages consistency in <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/incident-classification">how incidents are classified</a> and what responses each severity level demands. This consistency encourages fast and confident incident responses via streamlined collaboration.</p><h3>Reliability engineering fosters an empathetic culture of learning</h3><p>SRE isn’t just a set of practices and policies—it’s a mentality on how to develop software in a culture free of blame. By embracing this new mindset, your team’s morale and camaraderie will improve, allowing everyone to work at their full potential in a <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/fostering-psychological-safety">psychologically safe environment</a>.<br></p><p>SRE teaches us that failure is inevitable. No matter how many precautions you take, incidents happen. While giving you the tools to respond effectively to these incidents, SRE also challenges us to celebrate these failures. When something new goes wrong, it means there’s a chance to learn about your systems. This attitude creates an environment of <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/promoting-continuous-learning-with-sre">continuous learning</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When analyzing these inevitable incidents, it’s important to maintain an attitude of <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/why-companies-can-benefit-from-blameless-culture">blamelessness</a>. Instead of wasting time pointing fingers and finding fault, work together to find the systematic issues behind the incident. By avoiding a culture of blame and shame, engineers are less afraid to proactively raise issues. Team members will trust each other more, assuming good faith in their teammates’ choices. This spirit of blameless collaboration will transform the most challenging incidents into opportunities for growing stronger together.<br></p><p>At the heart of these lessons is the <a href="https://www.blameless.com/blog/sre-human-approach">idea of putting the human first</a>: either when considering the impact of reliability on users, or the developers keeping things afloat. Success depends on understanding how your users and developers feel and truly empathizing with them when making decisions. SRE gives you the tools to connect these empathetic insights with actionable data.<br></p><blockquote>SRE isn’t just a set of practices and policies—it’s a mentality on how to develop software in a culture free of blame. By embracing this new mindset, your team’s morale and camaraderie will improve, allowing everyone to work at their full potential in a psychologically safe environment.</blockquote><h3>Starting your reliability engineering journey</h3><p>In the era of reliability, there’s no better time than now to start on your SRE journey!<br></p><p>For learning the practical details of SRE, check out <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/toc/">Google’s landmark textbook</a> or the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/site-reliability-engineering-slos">accompanying Coursera course</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How much do you think software <a href="https://packetlost.dev/tag:development" rel="nofollow"><span>#</span><span>development</span></a> has changed over the last 20 years? Many would say quite a bit. But, my opinion is that fundamentally not much has really changed. Many of us still use the tried and true method of telling a computer what to do: the terminal. While the <a href="https://packetlost.dev/tag:terminal" rel="nofollow"><span>#</span><span>terminal</span></a> has changed it's appearance a bit over the years, it's still fundamentally the same tool it was 50 years ago. But the terminal is really only the window, and the tools we use through it <em>have</em> changed over the years. At least for some of us. As someone who spends most of his day bashing away at my clicky mechanical keyboard, I'd like to share some of the modern tools that I use to do my job, many of which replace commonly installed *nix tools.</p>

<p>I'm always looking to improve and integrate new tools into my workflow. If you have any suggestions, feel free to email me at the address at the bottom of this post or message me on <a href="https://twitter.com/chiefnoah13" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hot-reload-all-the-things">🔥Hot🔥 Reload All the Things</h2>

<p><a href="http://eradman.com/entrproject/" rel="nofollow">entr(1)</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Edit → Compile → Test → Edit → Compile → Test → Edit → Compile → Test</p></blockquote>

<p>Have you ever found yourself in a loop of editing a file, executing/compiling it over and over and over again? Well here's the solution to your <em>home row →</em> ⬆️ RSI.</p>

<p>Well repeat no more! Enter <code>entr</code>, stage left. <code>entr</code> is a fairly simple command line utility that will execute a command whenever a file or list of files change. When combined with a utility like <code>find</code> or <code>fd</code> it becomes insanely powerful.</p>

<p>Some examples of what I use it for:</p>

<pre><code>fd ".+\.py" | entr python -m pytest some_test.py
fd -g "*.go" | entr -r go run cmd/server.go
</code></pre>

<p>My day job is primarily python, so a common use-case for me is in a <code>:term</code> using <code>neovim</code> with a similar command to run tests automatically after each file save, and similar for compiled languages such as Go.</p>

<p>Another common one is when developing a web server application. For example, in Go I use a command similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>fd -g "*.go" | entr -r sh -c "go build cmd/server.go -o server &amp;&amp; ./server"
</code></pre>

<p>This rebuilds and runs the server after every file change. The <code>-r</code> flag sends a SIGINT to the process when a file change is detected, and then re-executes the command. Pretty neat, right?</p>

<p>It's worth calling out that this is a common feature in many IDEs. As an occasional user of PyCharm, I've used the built-in equivalent to achieve the same result. However, I prefer to work in vim, so this fills that role for me.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-that-flag-again">What was that flag again?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd" rel="nofollow">fd(1)</a></p>

<p><code>find</code> has been a long-time tool for *nix users. But for someone who hasn't gotten used to the esoteric syntax of <code>find</code>, or is looking for something that requires typing a bit less (among many other really nice features), look no further than <code>fd</code>. You may have noticed I use <code>fd</code> in my previous example, <code>entr</code>.</p>

<p>I typically prefer glob patterns to regex for quick searches, so most of the time I add a <code>-g</code> to my commands to enable glob mode.</p>

<p>One of the areas that <code>fd</code> really shines is an improved templating syntax for the <code>--exec</code> / <code>-e</code> flag. The main GitHub readme has some pretty solid examples, so be sure to check out their <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/blob/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-silver-searcher">The Silver Searcher</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher" rel="nofollow">ag(1)</a></p>

<p>My life was changed the day I learned aboug <code>grep -r</code>. Recursively searching for text in a codebase is easily one my most common daily tasks. For my day job, we have... a <em>lot</em> of files, some rather large. The Silever Searcher, or just <code>ag</code> (the atomic symbol for Silver 🙂) is a simple replacement for <code>grep -r</code> that's more performant and has nice ANSI color coding in the terminal. The syntax is pretty similar to <code>grep</code> so it makes for a good drop-in replacement to speed up your workflow by those <em>crucial</em> few milliseconds.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/U2HscOd.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="all-things-old-are-new-again-and-with-lua">All things old are new again, and with Lua</h2>

<p><a href="https://neovim.io/" rel="nofollow">nvim(1)</a></p>

<p><code>nvim</code> is a fork of the infamous <code>vim</code> project. Much of the project has focused on cleaning up the codebase, adding async support (which was subsequently added to <code>vim</code> for version 8), and Lua as a first-class language. The Lua API in particular allows for more robust and easy to maintain plugins (in theory). That being said, I'm not big on diving deep into customizing my editor, though I've made several shortcuts and rely on a handful of plugins. I generally tend to focus on memorizing the default keybindings so when moving from system to system I don't have to unlearn or mess up text entry. Check out my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chiefnoah/dotfiles/tree/master/dotfiles/config/nvim/init.vim" rel="nofollow">dotfiles</a>!</p>

<p>Regardless of which editor you use on the daily, it's worth learning the basics of <code>vim</code>, it's available on nearly every Linux or Unix system and is particularly fantastic at making quick edits to config files.</p>

<h2 id="email-for-the-20th-century">Email for the 20th century</h2>

<p><a href="https://aerc-mail.org/" rel="nofollow">aerc(1)</a></p>

<p><code>aerc</code> is one of <a href="https://drewdevault.com/" rel="nofollow">Drew DeVault</a>'s projects, and was originally built to suit his particular workflow. Despite this, it's actually a really nice modern implementation of an IMAP4/SMTP/POP3 client for the terminal (provided you primarily use <code>text/plain</code>). It's far more intuitive than <code>mutt</code> or other alternatives that I've tried, and it's <strong>fast</strong>. Well, usually. I've noticed some minor performance issues with a high latency connection to the mail server, but overall the experience is fantastic and it's my client of choice for email.</p>

<h2 id="markdown-rendering-in-the-terminal">Markdown rendering... in the terminal!?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/MichaelMure/mdr" rel="nofollow">mdr(1)</a></p>

<p>Have you ever been working on a <code>README.md</code> and somehow forgotten that you need a double newline for it to actually render properly in markdown? I know I have way more than is reasonable for someone in my profession. Well to help with markdown rendering woes, <code>mdr</code> renders markdown with color highlighting and rich text formatting! It even tries to render images!</p>

<p>Given that not all of markdown's output format (typically HTML) is compatible with rendering to a terminal, it does make some compromises, but I've found it's fine 99% of the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1KPbMlA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For comparison on what this looks like rendered to HTML, check out that project's <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~chiefnoah/origin/tree/master/README.md" rel="nofollow">README.md</a>.</p>

<h2 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p>Some other tools that I like to use when appropriate, but I didn't feel like including in the main list:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/apenwarr/redo" rel="nofollow"><code>redo(1)</code></a> – <code>make</code> but much, <em>much</em> better
<ul><li>I prefer this to <code>make</code> as it lacks some of the strange formatting quirks of the Makefile, and it is generally easier to work with and understand</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki" rel="nofollow"><code>tmux(1)</code></a> – terminal multiplexing, who needs a desktop?</li>
<li><a href="https://tldr.sh/" rel="nofollow"><code>tldr(1)</code></a> – <code>man</code> pages quick reference
<ul><li>I don't actually use this one as much yet, I just haven't integrated it into my workflow, but I appreciate the project and likely will get to it eventually</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" rel="nofollow"><code>ripgrep</code>/<code>rg(1)</code></a> – similar to <code>ag(1)</code>, a faster more modern <code>grep -r</code> command
<ul><li>This one was added based on feedback. I don't use it, but many seem to prefer it</li></ul></li></ul>

It's basically a super-compressed image type. <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4" title="AVIF for Next-Generation Image Coding">Netflix</a> has already considered .avif superior to the JPEG, PNG, and even the newer WebP image formats for its image quality to compressed file size ratio.</p><p>The format was developed by the <a href="http://aomedia.org/">Alliance for Open Media</a> in collaboration with Google, Cisco, and Xiph.org (who worked with Mozilla, creators of the Firefox browser). This format was created to be an open-sourced and royalty-free image format (unlike JPEG XR, which is a file format that compresses down very small but requires expensive licensing to implement).</p><h2>AVIF Compared to JPEG and WebP</h2><p>AVIF offers significant file size reduction for images compared with JPEG or WebP; <strong>~50% savings compared to JPEG</strong>, and <strong>~20% savings compared to WebP</strong>.

It might be a little buggy as expected, but definitely functions well. In my opinion, this is the best option right now for converting and creating .avif files.</p><p><a href="https://squoosh-avif.netlify.app/"><picture><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-using-avif-images-today-squoosh-avif.jpg" width="768" loading="lazy" alt="Use Squoosh to convert and encode AVIF files."></picture></a></p><p><a href="https://squoosh-avif.netlify.app/">Squoosh (AVIF Beta)</a></p><p>If you are comfortable in the command line, you can use the offical AOMedia library, <a href="https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif">libavif</a>, to encode/decode AVIF files.

The <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element allows for progressive support as we can list the image sources in the order in which we want loaded, and the browser will load the first that it supports.

August 6, 2020 | https://mbuffett.com/posts/all-tacit-knowledge/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mbuffett.com/posts/all-tacit-knowledge/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>The Commonplace blog has been
<a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/">writing</a> a
<a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/">lot</a> on <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/three-kinds-of-tacit-knowledge/">tacit
knowledge</a> recently.
As someone who’s been programming for a long time (8ish years), these articles
resonated deeply. I won’t go into too much detail what tacit
knowledge is about, since the above posts do such a good job with it. If you’re
not familiar, check them out.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-knowledge-vs-tacit-knowledge">Explicit knowledge vs tacit knowledge</h2>
<p>Essentially, explicit knowledge is that which can be transferred verbally. For
example, I could tell someone the method name for pushing to an array in
JavaScript, what version of Python <code>print</code> went from a keyword to a function,
and the range of HTTP status codes that represent success. Maybe they’d need to
do some spaced repetition learning or something, but they can just memorize
these bits.</p>
<p>Tacit knowledge is resistant to this type of learning. For example, how would
you transfer the ability to debug a complex program, or how to determine when to
abstract, or how to evaluate a new technology? You might be able to come up with
some heuristics, but to reach your level they’d need the same experiences.
They’d need to struggle with debugging programs for roughly as long as you have.</p>
<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>
<p>This is the part where I trick you into reading my monads tutorial, which will
be the only monad tutorial on the internet to successfully explain monads. The
thing about monads is…</p>
<p>Just kidding. I think monad tutorials are an excellent case in point. The
monad tutorial pandemic went something like this. There are 47 monad tutorials
online. Bob reads all of them. He’s reading about how monads are burritos, how
they’re just laws, how they’re adjectives not nouns, how they’re just monoids in the category of endofunctors. But
at the end of the day, Bob sits down at his computer and can’t program with
monads any better than he could before reading about burritos and endofunctors.
Bob charges ahead anyways, and suddenly finds that he understands monads! He
must share his discovery with the world. Now there are 48 monad tutorials.</p>
<p>The problem revealed by the (ongoing) deluge of monad tutorials, is that working
with monads is tacit knowledge, and tacit knowledge (by definition) is
resistant to direct knowledge transfer, like blog posts and videos.</p>
<h2 id="the-monad-tutorial-problem-generalized">The monad tutorial problem, generalized</h2>
<p>Using monads is far from the only thing in programming that is more implicit
than explicit. My explicit knowledge is very very little of what makes me a good
programmer. If tomorrow I forgot every HTTP status code and all the Python
standard library I know (embarrassingly little, and I’ve used it at three jobs),
I’d be barely affected. All of that is a search away. But if you somehow took
away the patterns engraved in my brain for debugging, or the gut feeling for
whether a problem lies in this module or that module, or how to structure a
program, I think I’d just quit. Because I can’t just search for that stuff, I’d
need another 8 years of struggle to get that back.</p>
<p>I think about this kind of stuff for a lot of the programming material I see
online. A blog post will espouse the author’s thoughts on ex. premature
optimization, or abstraction.
Unfortunately, knowing when to optimize and when to abstract are hard-earned implicit
skills. You probably won’t be able to explain how to do them well in a blog post
any better than you’ll be able to explain how to swing a tennis racquet.</p>
<p>I’m not saying all programming material is useless. I’ve benefited a ton from
programming blogs/videos. Most of the time, the value comes from being pointed
in a direction. For example, years ago I read a post on how a company set up
mutation testing, I read through it all and somewhere in my brain there was a
small note: “hey you should check out mutation testing”. I checked it out later
and it was cool. Was I any better at it because I had read through that whole
post? Nope, but it got me to check it out.</p>
<p>In the vein of useful programming material, there are a ton of blog posts that
solve a specific problem, and these have been invaluable. I don’t know how I’d
get through the day without posts like “How to Set Up letsencrypt on
Kubernetes” or “Minimize Haskell Image Sizes With Docker Multistage Builds”.
These easily-transferable bits can save hours.</p>
<h2 id="the-point">The point</h2>
<p>The point here is different for different audiences.</p>
<p>For beginner programmers, try to recognize when what you’re learning is implicit
knowledge. If you’re learning something fuzzy like how to best structure a
program, or when to use OOP vs FP, or how to scrape websites, you probably won’t
benefit too much from reading about it. Maybe read a small amount of high-level
stuff. To analogize programming to tennis, read enough to know that you should
hold the racquet with one hand and that you need to get the ball over the
net, but then go hit some forehands.</p>
<p>For expert programmers, I think it’s useful to know when trying to convey your
knowledge is going to be futile. For example, I consider myself very good
at determining when I can hack something together quickly and when I need
to take things slow. I’ll never write a post on how to make that distinction
though. If I got that skill erased from my
brain, I wouldn’t be able to go back to my post and re-learn it from some
post-hoc heuristics. We’ve learned from <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/">trying and failing to build expert
systems</a> that
that’s just not how tacit knowledge works.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Air Canada today reported unrestricted liquidity of&nbsp;$9.120 billionat&nbsp;June 30, 2020, in line with Air Canada’s expectations, compared to unrestricted liquidity of&nbsp;$7.380 billion&nbsp;at&nbsp;December 31, 2019.&nbsp;Total revenues fell from&nbsp;$4.738 billion&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2019 to&nbsp;$527 million&nbsp;in the second quarter this year, a decline of&nbsp;$4.211 billion&nbsp;or 89 per cent. Cargo revenue increased 52 per cent to&nbsp;$269 million.&nbsp;<br></p>

<h2>Air Canada Cost Reduction and Capital Reduction and Deferral Program</h2>



<ul><li>Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;initiated a company-wide cost reduction and capital reduction and deferral program as a result of COVID-19, which has now reached approximately&nbsp;$1.3 billion, increased from an initial target of&nbsp;$500 million. Excluding depreciation, amortization, and special items, second quarter 2020 operating expenses decreased&nbsp;$2.462 billion&nbsp;or 64 per cent from the same quarter in 2019. Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;continues to seek additional opportunities for cash preservation.&nbsp;</li><li>Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;announced a workforce reduction of approximately 20,000 employees, representing more than 50 per cent of its workforce. This was achieved through layoffs, terminations of employment, voluntary separations, early retirements, and special leaves.&nbsp;</li><li>Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;adopted the&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) for most of its workforce effective&nbsp;March 15, 2020. On&nbsp;July 17, 2020, the Government of&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;announced that the program would be redesigned and extended to&nbsp;December 2020. Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;intends to continue its participation in the CEWS program, subject to meeting the eligibility requirements.&nbsp;</li><li>Air&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;is retiring 79 older aircraft from its fleet – consisting of Boeing 767, Airbus A319 and Embraer 190 aircraft. Their retirement will simplify the airline’s overall fleet, reduce its cost structure, and lower its carbon footprint.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>“As with many other major airlines worldwide, Air Canada’s second quarter results confirm the devastating and unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed travel and border restrictions and quarantine requirements.&nbsp;Canada’s&nbsp;federal and inter-provincial restrictions have been among the most severe in the world, effectively shutting down most commercial aviation in our country, which, together with otherwise fragile demand, resulted in Air Canada carrying less than four per cent of the passengers carried during last year’s second quarter. In the face of such an impossible operating environment, I am extremely proud of the outstanding efforts our team is making, doing everything possible to successfully navigate this crisis, leveraging our strong balance sheet and the many other assets we developed or acquired over the last decade,” said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.</p>



<p>“Since mid-March, we have raised&nbsp;$5.5 billion&nbsp;in new equity, debt and aircraft financings in the capital markets, providing us with over&nbsp;$9 billion&nbsp;in liquidity as of&nbsp;June 30th&nbsp;to help weather the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, we have taken decisive action to cut spending and preserve liquidity – including a major management and front-line workforce reduction, a&nbsp;$1.3 billion&nbsp;reduction of our fixed costs and capital investments, the permanent retirement of 79 aircraft (representing more than 30 per cent of our combined mainline and Air Canada Rouge fleet), the indefinite suspension of certain domestic routes and station closures, and a reduction in our network seat capacity of 92&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;in the quarter. These were some of the painful but necessary steps we have taken to stabilize our airline and preserve cash in these uncertain times. We will now look to the future using this unprecedented challenge as an equally unprecedented opportunity to rebuild a smaller but even more nimble airline, with a simplified and younger fleet and a lower cost structure coming out of the crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Above all, today’s reported declines in revenue of nearly 90 per cent and in passengers of over 96 per cent, should reinforce the tremendous urgency for governments in&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;to take reasonable steps to safely reopen our country and restore economic activity. Other jurisdictions globally are showing it is possible to safely and responsibly manage the complementary priorities of public health, economic recovery and job preservation and creation. This is why Air Canada recently added its voice to that of many business and union leaders, including more than 140 major Canadian corporations and travel and tourism companies, employing nearly three million Canadians, in calling on the Government of&nbsp;Canada&nbsp;to take prudent steps to replace current blanket travel restrictions and quarantines with targeted evidence-based measures that reflect current circumstances.</p>



<p>“For our part, Air Canada is laser-focused on business continuity and in positioning ourselves to emerge competitively as the pandemic recedes. To promote customer safety and confidence, we introduced Air Canada CleanCare+, a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to biosafety at all phases of the journey. As well, we have slowly begun&nbsp;to rebuild our network, recalling a small number of employees and selectively restoring the award-winning services that have placed Air Canada among the world’s great airlines. For this I thank our employees for all of their incredible efforts and dedication and together we look forward to greeting our returning customers,” said Mr. Rovinescu.</p>

<p>About 8 years ago, I had started a new job and was already overwhelmed with all the work. So I found the most productive person I knew (my boss at the time) and asked him how he kept up with all of his tasks. He walked me through the wonder that is Omnifocus, with his tagging system and subtasks and contexts and dependent tasks, and by the end I was foaming at the mouth with excitement. This was the answer!</p>



<p>Then he said “but I wouldn’t suggest any of this.” He said that tools like Omnifocus, with all of their power and sophistication, lead people down the path of productivity porn. Productivity porn, he said, means that you spend more time setting up and tweaking your productivity system than the time that system saves you.</p>



<p>8 years later, I’m seeing this more than ever. The rise of <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> has made it especially common. People set up massive color coded dashboards with advanced layouts and databases and template buttons, and they feel like they’re ready to take on the world. </p>



<p>Here’s an example (taken from <a href="https://twitter.com/optemization/status/1288608463472353280">a tweet</a>):</p>



<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeIOSOiUEAAzIyJ?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt=""></figure>



<p>The dirty truth is that stuff like that will only make us marginally more productive than a text file, if that. We almost certainly won’t get back the dozens of hours we spend tweaking it. But we convince ourselves that it’s valuable because it’s fun, and fun things that aren’t valuable make us feel guilty, and we don’t like to feel guilty.</p>



<p>It’s a hobby. It’s something we enjoy doing, so we do it. But it’s a dangerous hobby, because it’s so easy to convince ourselves that it’s a valuable use of time rather than just a fun use of time. When we spend a day playing video games or watching Netflix, we get hit with the old “that was a waste of a day” guilt. But when we spend a day tweaking our productivity system, we feel like we <em>did something</em>, even though we really didn’t. This is the trap.</p>



<p>The vast majority of people would be roughly as productive with a pen and paper or a basic text file as they would with an insane Notion dashboard or a beefy Omnifocus setup. Fiddling with productivity systems is just fun, and the fun factor is already a great reason to spend time on something. We don’t need to pretend that it’s anything beyond that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Need your electricity terminology explained in a simple way? Learn what Volts, Amps and Watts really are and why they matter.</strong></p><h2>What is Volts or voltage?</h2><p>So when you get your home energy bill, it lists the usage in kilowatt-hours. But when you go to the store, you’ll see things like 12 watts, light bulbs, nine-volt batteries, and vacuum cleaners with 15 amps of sucking power. But what do these numbers even mean? I mean, why do we have so many different units to measure something that seems as straight forward as electricity? Surprisingly, the answer isn’t just so appliance companies and physics professors can confuse you. It’s because several important things have to happen in an electrical circuit for electricity to flow and for work to be done. You can think of a circuit, kind of like the faucet on your kitchen sink. If you want the water to come out, you need two things. You need the water itself and some pressure to force it through the pipes, out your faucet and into your neti pot.</p><p>Similarly, an electrical circuit uses electrons to carry the electricity, kind of like the water in our faucet analogy, but those electrons need something to push them along a circuit. This electrical pressure is what we call voltage and is often provided by two terminals, one with a positive charge and one with a negative charge. So on a battery electrons flow from the negative end through whatever it is you’re trying to power. And then into the positive end where they’ll stay, unless your battery is rechargeable. If you’re plugging something into the wall, this voltage is instead provided by your power company. And although voltage just measures how strongly electricity is being pushed through a circuit, it’s important because many circuits are designed only to accept a certain number of volts, which is why the hairdryer you bought in Monaco might release magic blue smoke if you plug it in, in New York.</p><h2>What is amps or amperes?</h2><p>So now that you know what volts are, what about amps? Well, in this context, amp, isn’t short for an amplifier, but rather for ampere, which is a unit of how much electrical charge is flowing past a given point in one second. So when you put volts and amps together, you can tell how much current is flowing and how hard it’s flowing, multiply these numbers. And you get finally our third unit, the wat. Let’s go back to our water analogy for a second and let’s suppose you wanted to spin a small water wheel because you just like watching things spin, or I don’t know, maybe you have it hooked up to an electric motor. Let’s say you have a really powerful water pistol that forces water through a nozzle. Even though the nozzle means the total volume of water flowing per second, isn’t all that much. You wouldn’t want to fill your swimming pool with it.</p><h2>What is Watts?</h2><p>The high pressure creates a strong jet that can spin the wheel easily. But suppose instead of a water gun, you have a much wider hose that doesn’t push the water out nearly as strong, but because the hose is a lot wider, more water flows per second overall, and the wheel ends up spinning at the same speed it did with your water gun. If we think of the hose and the water gun pushing out electricity, instead of water, we could say that they’re delivering the same number of Watts for a more practical example. Let’s say you have an 1100 watt power supply for your computer. That’s drawing the full load, so if you plug that into a standard 110 volt, North American outlet, some simple math tells you that 10 amps of current are running through your power supply.</p><p>But if you take that same power supply and use it with a 220-volt European outlet, you’re only drawing five amps. But since the amount of power in Watts is the same, your computer will work just fine in both places, even though you’re using different volts and amps. The same thing applies to electric vehicles. As long as you have the same power in Watts, it doesn’t matter if you use a supercharger in Europe or America, even though there are two different standards. Well, that makes sense, but why the heck then is my energy bill in kilowatt-hours? Is that a unit of time? No, actually scientists are just mean it’s a unit of energy Watts and kilowatts express how much energy is consumed per chunk of time. Something scientists call power, which is not the same as energy. But if you multiply kilowatt by an hour, the units cancel and you’re left with a number that shows how much energy that you hogged by running your air conditioner, charging station, and novelty lava lamp all at once.</p><p>But what if you’re more concerned about battery capacity instead of what’s coming out of your walls? Well, if you’re buying a replacement battery or a battery pack, you might see their capacity listed in milliamp hours. Again, not time doing the math shows that this is a unit of charge, not energy or power. So going back to our water example, this is like how much water you have in a bucket, not how much is flowing or how fast is flowing. So a bigger bucket means you could charge your phone or car more times.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>My KVM Forum 2018 presentation titled <a href="https://vmsplice.net/~stefan/stefanha-kvm-forum-2018.pdf">Security in QEMU: How Virtual Machines provide Isolation (pdf)</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAdRf_hwxU8">(video)</a> reviewed security bugs in QEMU and found the most common causes were C programming bugs. This includes buffer overflows, use-after-free, uninitialized memory, and more. In this post I will argue for using Rust as a safer language that prevents these classes of bugs.</p>
        <p>In 2018 the choice of a safer language was not clear. C++ offered safe abstractions without an effective way to prohibit unsafe language features. Go also offered safety but with concerns about runtime costs. Rust looked promising but few people had deep experience with it. In 2018 I was not able to argue confidently for moving away from C in QEMU.</p>
        <p>Now in 2020 the situation is clearer. C programming bugs are still the main cause of <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=7506">CVEs in QEMU</a>. Rust has matured, its ecosystem is growing and healthy, and there are virtualization projects like <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/">Crosvm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/">Firecracker</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor">cloud-hypervisor</a> that prove Rust is an effective language for writing Virtual Machine Monitors (VMM). In the QEMU community Paolo Bonzini and Sergio Lopez's work on <a href="https://github.com/rust-vmm/">rust-vmm</a> and vhost-user code inspired me to look more closely at moving away from C.</p>

        <h2>Do we need to change programming language?</h2>
        <p>Most <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=7506">security bugs in QEMU</a> are C programming bugs. This is easy to verify by looking through the CVE listings. Although I have only reviewed CVEs it seems likely that non-security bugs are also mostly C programming bugs.</p>

        <p>Eliminating C programming bugs does not necessarily require switching programming languages. Other approaches to reducing bug rates in software include:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Coding style rules that forbid unsafe language features.</li>
            <li>Building safe abstractions and prohibiting unsafe language features or library APIs.</li>
            <li>Static checkers that scan source code for bugs.</li>
            <li>Dynamic sanitizers that run software with instrumentation to identify bugs.</li>
            <li>Unit testing and fuzzing.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>The problem is, the QEMU community has been doing these things for years but new bugs are still introduced despite these efforts. It is certainly possible to spend more energy on these efforts but the evidence shows that bugs continue to slip through.</p>

        <p>There are two issues with these approaches to reducing bugs. First,
        although these approaches help find existing bugs, eliminating classes
        of bugs so they cannot exist in the first place is a stronger approach.
        This is hard to do with C since the language is unsafe, placing the
        burden of safety on the programmer.</p>

        <p>Second, much of the ability to write safe C code comes with
        experience. Custom conventions, APIs, tooling, and processes
        to reduce bugs is a hurdle for one-time contributors or
        newcomers. It makes the codebase inaccessible unless we accept lower
        standards for some contributors. Code quality should depend as little
        on experience as possible but C is notorious for being a programming
        language that requires a lot of practice before you can write
        production-quality code.</p>

        <h2>Why Rust?</h2>
        <p>Safe languages eliminate memory safety bugs (and other classes like
        concurrency bugs). <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> made this a priority in its design:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Use-after-free, double-free, memory leaks, and other lifetime bugs are prevented at compile-time by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html">borrow checker</a> where the compiler checks ownership of data.</li>
            <li>Buffer overflows and other memory corruptions are prevented by compile-time and runtime bounds-checking.</li>
            <li>Pointer deference bugs are prevented by the absense of NULL pointers and strict ownership rules.</li>
            <li>Uninitialized memory is prevented because all variables and fields must be initialized.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>Rust programs can still "panic" at runtime when safety cannot be
        proven at compile time but this does not result in undefined behavior
        as seen in C programs. The program simply aborts with a backtrace. Bugs
        that could have resulted in arbitrary code execution in C become at
        most denial-of-service bugs in Rust. This reduces the severity of
        bugs.</p>

        <p>As a result of this language design most C programming bugs that
        plague QEMU today are either caught by the compiler or turn into a safe
        program termination. It is reasonable to expect CVEs to reduce in
        number and in severity when switching to Rust.</p>

        <p>At the same time Rust eliminates the need for many of the measures
        that the QEMU community added onto C because the Rust programming
        language and its compiler already enforce safety. This means newcomers
        and one-time contributors will not need QEMU-specific experience, can
        write production-quality code more easily, and can get their code
        merged more quickly. It also means reviewers will have to spend less
        time pointing out C programming bugs or asking for changes that comply
        with QEMU's way of doing things.</p>

        <p>That said, Rust has a reputation for being a scary language due to
        the borrow checker. Most programmers have not thought about object
        lifetimes and ownership as systematically and explicitly as required
        by Rust. This raises the bar to learning the language, but I look at it
        this way: learning Rust is humanly possible, writing bug-free C code is
        not.</p>

        <h2>How can we change programming language?</h2>
        <p>When I checked in 2018 QEMU was 1.5 million lines of code. It has
        grown since then. Moving a large codebase to a new programming language
        is extremely difficult. If people want to convert QEMU to Rust that
        would be great, but I personally don't have the appetite to do it
        because I think the integration will be messy, result in a lot of
        duplication, and there is too much un(der)maintained code that is hard
        to convert.</p>

        <p>The reason I am writing this post is because device emulation, the
        main security attack surface for VMMs, can be done in a separate
        program. That program can be written in any language and this is where
        Rust comes in. For vhost devices it is possible to write Rust
        device backends today and I hope this will become the default approach to
        writing new devices.</p>

        <p>For non-vhost devices the <a href="https://patchew.org/QEMU/1594913503-52271-1-git-send-email-thanos.makatos@nutanix.com/">vfio-user</a>
        project is working on an interface out-of-process device emulation. It
        will be possible to implement devices in Rust there too.</p>

        <p>If you are implementing new device emulation code please consider
        doing it in Rust!</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Most security bugs in QEMU today are C programming bugs. Switching
        to a safer programming language will significantly reduce security bugs
        in QEMU. Rust is now mature and proven enough to use as the language
        for device emulation code. Thanks to vhost-user and vfio-user using
        Rust for device emulation does not require a big conversion of QEMU
        code, it can simply be done in a separate program. This way attack
        surfaces can be written in Rust to make them less susceptible to
        security bugs going forward.</p>

    <!-- .entry-header -->

    <div>

		
<p>We are happy to announce a new addition to our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance" target="_blank">Public Marketplace</a>: the service appliance with several <strong>Virtual Network Functions</strong> (<strong>VNFs</strong>), the virtualized network services including the <strong>Virtual Router</strong>. Based on <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alpine Linux</a>, it comes with a number of useful network functions:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCPv4 server</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Recursive_and_caching_name_server">DNS recursor</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">IPv4 Network Address Translator</a> (i.e. NAT, IP Masquerade)</li><li><a href="http://docs.opennebula.io/stable/operation/network_management/vrouter.html">Virtual Router</a></li></ul>



<p>A <strong>High Availability</strong> option is provided by <a href="https://www.keepalived.org/">Keepalived</a>. If you are (or were) using the <a href="http://docs.opennebula.io/stable/operation/network_management/vrouter.html">OpenNebula Virtual Routers</a>, it might be interesting for you to know that the new appliance is an improved version built upon the old (and now legacy) VRouter appliance, which implemented only virtual routing functionality.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-06-10-13-48.png" alt="" width="574" height="308" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-06-10-13-48.png 765w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-from-2020-08-06-10-13-48-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px"></figure></div>



<p>You’ll find <strong>two new virtual appliances</strong> available on our Public Marketplace. They are based on the same image, but with different (Virtual Machine) templates and designed for different purposes:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://marketplace.opennebula.systems/appliance/7dba6a0d-73e8-4036-9cb8-73da669ee494">Service VNF</a>&nbsp;– exposing all features, but runs as regular Virtual Machine,</li><li><a href="https://marketplace.opennebula.systems/appliance/cc96d537-f6c7-499f-83f1-15ac4058750e">Service Virtual Router</a>&nbsp;– runs as OpenNebula Virtual Router.</li></ul>



<p>As of now the list of implemented VNFs is a bit limited, but it’s expected to grow in the future with other VNF services, so let us know your preferences! Some possibilities include load balancing, port forwarding, VPN, and others…</p>



<p>This new appliance is a little bit different from previous ones. It supports recontextualization and can adjust the behavior during run-time. You don’t need to start a brand new instance if your configuration requirements for a particular virtual network function change. Naturally, it will also react and reconfigure itself when network interfaces are dynamically added or removed.</p>



<p>Let’s see how this new functionality works when implementing a typical network router:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VRouter_img.png" alt="" width="543" height="459"></figure></div>



<p>As displayed on the picture, we have an instance of VNF/Virtual Router appliance with 3 connected NICs, each into a different virtual network. Interfaces <strong>eth1</strong> and <strong>eth2</strong> are connected to the distinct private networks and instance provides there DHCP and DNS services and routes between networks. Interface <strong>eth0</strong> goes to the Internet and all  traffic from private networks (<strong>eth1</strong>, <strong>eth2)</strong> goes through the Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanism, which means that clients on private networks can reach the public Internet “hidden” behind the IP address of the VNF/Virtual Router instance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of how to contextualize such VNF/Virtual Router instance in OpenNebula:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VRouter_context.png" alt="" width="264" height="627"></figure></div>



<p>We enable DHCPv4, NAT, and DNS VNFs (routing is enabled by default when the appliance is started as OpenNebula <a href="http://docs.opennebula.io/stable/operation/network_management/vrouter.html">Virtual Router</a>) and use a special syntax to define on which network interfaces is a particular function active. For both DHCP and DNS, we requested to run on every attached network interface <strong>except</strong> the public Internet-facing one (<strong>!eth0</strong> – notice the exclamation mark). We usually do not want to provide these services to the public Internet, both are dangerous if not used properly and could disrupt someone else’s infrastructure or become a victim of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDoS</a>. On the contrary, for the NAT VNF, we select that outgoing traffic will be NATed on the <strong>eth0</strong> interface, and nowhere else.</p>



<p>Now we can just simply attach (and detach) NICs into particular virtual networks and the VNF/Virtual Router will automatically reconfigure itself to provide the desired services with the requested constraints.  It does not matter if it has two, three, or more NICs attached to it. NAT will be enabled only on the first interface (<strong>eth0</strong>), with the other DHCP and DNS services active on all other interfaces.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this short example clarifies some of the key feature of the new VNF/Virtual Router appliances. As usual, you can find out more about them in our <a href="https://docs.opennebula.io/appliances/service/vnf.html">documentation</a> section.</p>



<p>And as always, we would love to hear from you about your experience using this appliance, and please send us your suggestions for future improvements!</p>

  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

Sometimes the deck is split in half and the halves are switched.
Sometimes the deck is <em><a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/smooshing.gif">smooshed</a></em> until it’s all mixed up.
But most of the time, a deck of cards is shuffled using a <em>riffle</em>.</p><p><img src="https://fredhohman.com/card-shuffling/static/images/riffle.gif" idyll="[object Object]"></p><p>Here’s a question: <em>how many times do you have to riffle a deck of cards before it is completely shuffled?</em>

It’s a tricky one, but math has us covered: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling#Riffle">you need seven riffles</a>.</p><div><p>
We can calculate the number of orderings of a deck of cards using the notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation">permutation</a>.
To find all arrangements of 52 cards in a deck, we compute <strong>5<!-- -->2<!-- -->!</strong>, which happens to be a <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=52!">really big number</a>.</p></div><p>Riffle seven times and you’ll have a sufficiently random ordering of cards, an ordering that has likely <a href="http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/cardperms.htm">never existed before</a>.
In other words, it’s unlikely you’ll ever shuffle two decks the same.</p><p>The card shuffling result appears in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI">Numberphile video from 2015</a>, along with a number of other card shuffling facts.
Here’s another problem posed in that video: what if instead of a standard riffle using a deck roughly split in half, you were to only riffle <em>1<!-- --> card at a time</em>?</p><div><p><a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoap/1177005705">This paper</a> shows a number of other interesting card shuffling results in all their gory details.</p></div><p>That is, using a standard deck of 52 cards, in one hand hold 51 cards and in the other hold the remaining single card.
Now riffle these together.
This is equivalent to taking one card and placing it at random inside of the deck.</p><p><strong>So here’s the question:</strong>
<br><em>How many single riffles do you have to do in order to have a completely shuffled deck?</em>

</p><h2>Theorem</h2><p>You could simulate this in a short program, which we will do towards the end, but first we can solve for the number of riffles explicitly.</p><p>Consider an ordered deck of cards. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality">Without loss of generality</a>, let’s say the suits are in the following order: <span suit="S">♠</span>, <span suit="C">♣</span>, <span suit="H">♥</span>, <span suit="D">♦</span>.
So our ordered deck looks like this.</p><p>The bottom suit is <span suit="D">♦</span>, which means the bottom card of our deck is the King of Diamonds (<span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>).
Now perform the following iteration:</p><blockquote>Place the top card of the deck randomly inside the deck</blockquote><p>This means taking the <span number="A" suit="S">A♠</span> and placing it randomly somewhere in the deck.
The top card then becomes <span number="2" suit="S">2♠</span>.</p><p>If this procedure is repeated, eventually the top card will be placed at the very bottom of the deck, shifting the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> to the penultimate position.
Since every riffled card has a <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span> chance of moving to any new position in the deck, that means, on average, after about 52 top card riffles, the top card will become the new bottom card.</p><div><div><p><strong>Note:</strong> notice the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> can only rise in the deck.
There are two cases:</p><ol><li>The top card is placed above the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, therefore its position does not change.</li><li>The top card is placed underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, therefore it rises one position closer to the top.</li></ol></div></div><p>Once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> moves up one position, upon subsequent riffles there are now two spots for the new top card to be placed underneath it.
That means there is now a <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}+\frac{1}{52}=\frac{2}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span> chance of a riffled card going underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>.</p><p>Continuing this procedure, the original bottom card, the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, will eventually rise to the top of the deck and be riffled.
Once this happens, the deck is randomly shuffled: the order we’re left with is equally as likely as any other order.</p><p>So, how many single card riffles does this take?
Recall each time a card is placed underneath the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>, our chances of placing another card increases by <span><span> <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{52}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> </span></span>.
We can calculate the number of riffles this would take.</p><p><span><span> <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>≈</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sum_{i=1}^{52} \frac{52}{i} = \frac{52}{1} + \frac{52}{2} + \frac{52}{3} + ... + \frac{52}{52} \approx 236</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> </span></span></p><p>On average, 236 single card riffles will randomly shuffle a deck of cards.</p><h2>Let’s Riffle</h2><p>Equations are great, but let’s visualize this!
Below is the same ordered deck of cards from before, except the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> has been highlighted red so we can follow its journey to the top of the deck.</p><p>Click the <strong>Riffle</strong> button to move the top card somewhere else in the deck randomly.</p><p>Did you see where it went? Click again.</p><p>Click a bunch more really fast.</p><p>Now I could tell you to keep clicking until the highlighted <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> rises to the top, but as we have already shown, that would take about 236 clicks.
Instead, click the <strong>Riffle (x<!-- -->1<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</strong> button to riffle 10 times.
Keep riffling until the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> moves to the top.</p><div><p>
You have riffled <strong><span>0</span></strong> times.<br></p></div><p>Here is a chart of the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span>’s position in the deck for each riffle.
Notice how it takes many riffles to move the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> up just a few positions, but once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> starts rising towards the top of the deck, it accelerates.</p><div><p>
Once the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> is the top card, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button to try again.</p></div><p>On average, the <span number="K" suit="D">K♦</span> will reach the top position somewhere around 236 riffles.
Since this is the <em>average</em> result, there is a chance your first shuffled deck of cards took less riffles (or many more!).
To try again, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button and get riffling.</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><ul><li>This article was created using <a href="https://idyll-lang.org/">Idyll</a>.</li><li>Shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/mathisonian">@mathisonian</a> <!-- -->for help and feedback.</li><li>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/fredhohman/card-shuffling/">Github</a>.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the open <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction set architecture (ISA)</a> is the vector extension (RISC-V "V").
In contrast to the average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">single-instruction multipe-data (SIMD)</a> instruction set, RISC-V vector instructions are vector length agnostic (VLA).
Thus, a RISC-V "V" CPU is flexible in choosing a vector register size while RISC-V "V" binary code is portable between different CPU implementations.</p>
<p>This articles compares the two main different styles of vector ISAs, discusses a string processing  example that is implemented using <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V "V" draft version 0.8</a> (current as of early 2020) vector instructions and details how to set up a RISC-V "V" development environment under Linux.</p>

<section id="simd-challenges">
<h2><a href="#id13">SIMD Challenges</a></h2>
<p>With a vector length specific (VLS) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> instruction set the main problem is to pick the right vector register size.
Of course there is a trade-off between the amount of data-level parallelism and hardware costs.
Due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>, vector register sizes can be increased over time without making the CPU chip more expensive.
Also, some users are interested in powerful CPUs with wider vector registers while the average user is fine with averagely sized register.
Thus, there is no one right vector register size.
This shows for example with x86, where the answer is to provide one VLS ISA after the other, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)">MMX</a> (64 bit registers), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions">SSE</a> (128 bit), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a> (256 bit) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512">AVX512</a> (512 bit).</p>
<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backward compatibility</a>, each CPU that adds a new VLS ISA also has to support all existing ones.
This leads to a waste of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode">opcode</a> space and increases the complexity of the CPU's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle#Decode_stage">instruction decoder</a>.
Of course this also increases the complexity for the programmer who has then remember (or look up all the time) syntactic and functional differences between all the VLS ISAs.</p>
<p>That means that while VLS code written for smaller vector registers runs on newer CPUs, it can't make use of the wider vector registers.
Thus, existing code has to be reimplemented again and again to make use of new VLS ISAs.
Similarly, code written for high-end CPUs doesn't run on middle-end CPUs (because it requires the VLS-ISA with wider vector registers).
Thus one either has to target some older (hopefully widely available) VSL-ISA or has to provide multiple implementations for different VSL-ISAs.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-solution-agnosticism">
<h2><a href="#id14">The Solution: Agnosticism</a></h2>
<p>The solution to all this is to design a variable length vector instruction set.
In that way the instructions are then agnostic to the vector register size of a concrete CPU implementation.
Thus, the binary code is portable between low, middle and high-end CPUs, and automatically makes use of wider registers in newer CPUs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V vector extension "V"</a> implements such vector instruction set.
As of early 2020, the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.8">RISC-V "V" specification</a> is at version 0.8 and has draft status.</p>
<p>RISC-V "V" adds 32 vector registers, where the first register can be used as mask register and up to 8 registers can be grouped together.
The operands of a vector instruction such as <code>vadd.vv</code> are single vector registers or vector register groups.</p>
<p>Since vector registers are of variable length, RISC-V "V" code has to indicate the maximum vector length it wants to work with, e.g.:</p>
<pre><span>vsetvli</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>e8</span></pre>
<p>Meaning that a vector length (vl) of up to <code>a2</code> 8 bit wide (<code>e8</code>) elements is requested while the instruction returns the resulting length in register <code>t0</code>.
Thus, if the <code>a2</code> register is set to - say - <code>4096</code>, on a CPU with a vector register length (VLEN) of 128 bits, the following vector instructions work on 16 element wide vectors and <code>t0</code> is thus set to <code>16</code>, while on a CPU with 512 bit registers the vectors are configured to be 64 elements wide and <code>t0</code> is set to <code>64</code>.</p>
<p>This approach also simplifies loops that iterate over an input array in vector length chunks.
For example (where <code>a1</code> contains the address of an array of <code>a2</code> times 4 bytes):</p>
<pre><span>.Loop:</span>                        <span># local symbol name because of .L prefix</span>
    <span>vsetvli</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>e32</span>       <span># configure vectors of 32 bit elements</span>

    <span>vlw.v</span>   <span>v4</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>a1</span><span>)</span>          <span># Load t0 elements into v4,</span>
                              <span># starting at the address stored in a1</span>

    <span>...</span>                       <span># work with that chunk</span>

    <span>slli</span>    <span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>t0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span>         <span># shift-left logical, i.e. times 4</span>
    <span>add</span>     <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>t1</span>        <span># increment src by read elements</span>
    <span>sub</span>     <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>t0</span>        <span># decrement n</span>
    <span>bnez</span>    <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>.Loop</span>         <span># branch to loop head if not equal to zero</span>

    <span>...</span>                       <span># continue</span></pre>
<p>In cases where <code>a2</code> isn't a multiple of the maximum vector length, the last iteration
sets the vector length to a smaller value and the following vector instructions ignore
the unused trailing elements.
This implicit masking mechanism is orthogonal to the optional mask operand that is supported by most RISC-V vector instructions.</p>
<p>In contrast to that, with a vector length specific ISA, the main loop usually has to be followed by some finalization code block to explicitly deal with the last elements that don't fill a complete register, e.g.:</p>
<pre><span>const</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>inp</span><span>;</span>
<span>size_t</span> <span>l</span> <span>=</span> <span>n</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>VECTOR_LENGTH</span> <span>*</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>+=</span> <span>VECTOR_LENGTH</span> <span>*</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// load p into a vector register</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// execute some vector instructions</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>// deal with some remaining bytes</span>
<span>// e.g. by setting up a mask or work on single elements</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>l</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span> <span>+=</span> <span>ELEMENT_BYTES</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> <span>// work on the next element located at p</span>
<span>}</span></pre>

<section id="example">
<h2><a href="#id15">Example</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate RISC-V "V" with a real example, this section shows how to implement a vectorized function that converts a string of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary coded decimals (BCD)</a> into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> string.
Why BCD to ASCII conversion?
The task is complex enough such that most of the different vector instructions are used.
On the other hand, it's simple enough to fit into a small article and doesn't require domain specific knowledge.
It also demonstrates some perhaps not entirely obvious ways how vector instructions are used for string processing where those instruction could be assumed to only be useful for calculations.</p>
<p>With BCD, a byte (8 bits) is divided into two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble">nibbles</a> (4 bits) such that each nibble stores a (hexa-)decimal digit.
Note that 4 bits allow to exactly encode <span>2<sup>4</sup></span> values, thus when using it just for storing decimal digits it's not a very efficient encoding.</p>
<p>For the purpose of our example, the exercise is to write vector code that efficiently converts a BCD string such as <code>{ 0x12, 0x34, ..., 0xcd, 0xef }</code> to a corresponding ASCII string (e.g. <code>{ '1', '2', '3', '4', ..., 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' }</code>). On a high-level, a solution involves separating the nibbles into single bytes and then converting each byte to the matching ASCII value.</p>
<p>The complete example source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/gsauthof/riscv">my github repository</a>.</p>
<section id="shuffling-nibbles">
<h3><a href="#id16">Shuffling Nibbles</a></h3>
<p>Our function has the following function signature:</p>
<pre><span>void</span> <span>bcd2ascii</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>dst</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>const</span> <span>*</span> <span>src</span><span>,</span> <span>size_t</span> <span>n</span><span>);</span></pre>
<p>Meaning that <code>n</code> input bytes are read from <code>src</code> and the conversion writes <code>2*n</code> bytes into the <code>dst</code> output buffer.
Under the RISC-V calling conventions, <code>dst</code> is passed in register <code>a0</code>, <code>src</code> in register <code>a1</code> and <code>n</code> in register <code>a2</code>.</p>
<pre><span>.Loop:</span>                        <span># local symbol name because of .L prefix</span>
    <span>vsetvli</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>e16</span><span>,</span> <span>m8</span>   <span># switch to 16 bit element size,</span>
                              <span># 4 groups of 8 registers</span>
    <span># --&gt; a3 = min(a2, 8*vlenb/2)</span>
    <span>vlbu.v</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>a1</span><span>)</span>          <span># Load a3 unsigned bytes,</span>
                              <span># one byte per 16 bit element, zero-extend,</span>
                              <span># starting at addr stored in a1</span>
    <span># --&gt; v16 = | 0, a1[vlenb/2-1], ..., 0, a1[1], 0, a1[0] |, ...,</span>
    <span>#     v23 = | 0, a1[a3-1],       ...,  0, a1[7*vlenb/2] |</span>
    <span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 00mn 00kl 00ij 00gh |</span>

    <span>add</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span>            <span># increment src by read elements</span>
    <span>sub</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span>            <span># decrement n</span></pre>
<p>The main loop starts with configuring a vector element size of 16 bit (<code>e16</code>), grouping 8 registers together (<code>m8</code>) and requesting a vector length that equals the number of remaining source bytes or the CPU maximum.
With this grouping, each register group is accessed by using a vector register with a number that is dividable by 8.
That means <code>v0</code> identifies the group consisting of <code>v0, v1, ..., v7</code>, <code>v8</code> identifies <code>v8, ..., v15</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>vl*.v</code> load instruction comes in different variants.
Here, the <code>vlbu.v</code> variant zero extends each input byte per 16 bit element which is useful in our example because this directly leaves room for shuffling the nibbles.
In other words, it's a widening load and thus saves a separate widening operation such as <code>vwaddu.vx</code>.</p>
<p>That means on CPUs with 256 bit vector registers, this code loads up to 128 input bytes into the <code>v16</code> register group.</p>
<p>Note that register content in the comments is enclosed in <code>| |</code> and written right to left, starting with the least significant element.
Arbitrary nibbles are denoted sometimes by placeholder variables such as <code>g, h, ...</code>.</p>
<p>The actual nibble shuffling:</p>
<pre><span>vsll.vi</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>8</span>       <span># shift-left-logical each element by 8 bits</span>
<span># --&gt; v24 = | ... mn00 kl00 ij00 gh00 |</span>

<span>vsrl.vi</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span>       <span># shift-right-logical each element by 4 bits</span>
<span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 000m 000k 000i 000g |</span>

<span>slli</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span>            <span># shift left logical by immediate,</span>
                          <span># i.e. to double the number of vector elements</span>
<span>vsetvli</span> <span>t4</span><span>,</span> <span>a3</span><span>,</span> <span>e8</span><span>,</span> <span>m8</span>    <span># switch to 8 bit element size,</span>
                          <span># 4 groups of 8 registers</span>

<span>vand.vx</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>v24</span><span>,</span> <span>t2</span>      <span># and each element with 0x0f,</span>
                          <span># i.e. zero-out the high nibbles</span>
<span># --&gt; v24 = | ... 0n 00 0l 00 0j 00 0h 00 |</span>
<span>vor.vv</span>  <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v16</span><span>,</span> <span>v24</span>     <span># or each element</span>
<span># --&gt; v16 = | ... 0n 0m 0l 0k 0j 0i 0h 0g |</span></pre>
<p>So far the example shows most of the syntactic conventions of the "V" ISA.
Vector instructions start with <code>v</code> and a suffix such as <code>.vi</code>, <code>.vx</code> and <code>.vv</code> describe the source operand types, i.e. vector-immediate, vector-scalar and vector-vector.</p>
<p>The bit-shift instructions don't cross element boundaries.
Thus, just vector group <code>v24</code> has to be zero-masked and not <code>v16</code>.</p></section></section></article></div>

<p>
This is a very short article where we will be discussing two Javascript features that you may not know.</p>


<p>
So let's start,</p>

<p><b>1)Exponentiation operator(**):</b></p>
<p>
This operator was added in ES6 and is supported by most of the browsers but excluding internet explorer.</p>
<p>
It is also called an Infix operator for Exponentiation.</p>
<p>
Before for exponentiation, we have to use Math.pow(x,y).</p>
<p>
But now you can use x**y.</p>

<p>
For example: 2**5 //returns 32</p>

<p><b>2)Numeric Separators:</b></p>
<p>
Large numeric literals are difficult for the human eye to parse quickly,</p>
<p>
especially when there are lots of repeating digits. To improve readability, you can use</p>
<p>
underscores as separators in numeric literals.</p>

<p>
For example:</p>
<p>
let value= 100_000_000_00 //Is same as 10000000000</p>

<p>
As of May 2020, It is supported by all major browsers (Chrome[75+], Firefox[70+], Edge, Safari[13+], Opera) (<a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_grammar_numeric_separators">source 1</a>, <a href="https://v8.dev/features/numeric-separators">source 2</a> for more details about different browsers and versions supporting it)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Interesting note: although supported by all browsers, this is not part of any ECMAScript version yet.</p>

<p>In 2018, I skipped my own college graduation. Two days before, at dawn, I instead flew to the Bay Area to spend that weekend attending a retreat for young people in the technology industry. It was a three day long extravaganza, half conference, half party, funded by charging venture capitalists for the right to come in and chat about artificial intelligence and <a href="https://twitter.com/operaqueenie/status/1285265180885053440">life extension</a> with 22 year olds. The overarching topic of the weekend was how new technological tools could make the world a better place, as reflected in the retreat’s mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Technology isn’t an industry; it’s a tool that’s changing every industry.</p></li>
<li><p>People don’t make impact alone; great things are accomplished together.</p></li>
<li><p>We feel a deep sense of obligation to make the world better.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While the retreat had been running annually for half a decade, I suspect 2018 felt a little different. Amidst the growing unpopularity of the tech industry, we were meeting just a few months after the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. Many of us had growing disillusions of one sort or another with the large tech companies. Increasingly, it was hard to say their contributions to the world outweighed their misdeeds.</p>
<p>The young founders I met still hoped their startups could challenge the power of the large tech companies, and thus solve the ethical problems those companies bring to our industry. As just one of many examples, at some point I had dinner with one of the retreat directors, who told me excitedly about a startup that was optimizing neural network meta parameters. She believed neural networks, a technology that requires vast data collection and in some cases millions of dollars in server resources, could be wielded by startups against the establishment. Large corporations supposedly were too slow to capture this new market.</p>
<p>The founders at the retreat were mostly in the earlier stages of their startups, and perhaps this obscured the absurdity of this David vs. Goliath mentality in an industry where the most common successful outcome is getting acquired by a large tech company. But for now, let’s pretend our startup is able to overcome the monumental challenges against it, will refuse to sell, and will actually stay independent while growing exponentially. How would we dodge the shortcomings of the tech companies that exist already?</p>
<p>At the retreat, I often heard “incentive alignment” as a solution. This philosophy recognizes the profit models of many big tech companies have negative consequences. It knows any business is incentivized to turn a profit by any means possible. So the solution is to find a business model where the more a company profits, the more good it does in the world. This makes the business incentive aligned with their morals. I admire one company that abandoned many months of work and an otherwise promising platform in the therapy world, purely because they realized their profit model would incentivize bad outcomes for their patients: if their patients rapidly improved, they would also rapidly cancel their monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are major shortcomings with this approach. After all, Google was an incentive aligned company. In their 2004 IPO letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout Google’s evolution as a privately held company, we have managed Google differently…our goal is to develop services that improve the lives of as many people as possible—to do things that matter…Advertising is our principal source of revenue, and the ads we provide are relevant and useful rather than intrusive and annoying.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their belief was that, unlike existing companies that had perverse incentives, the ads they showed were relevant to people’s search queries, making their drive for profit aligned with their goal of universal access to information. This is the same argument made by startups claiming incentive alignment today. If a startup is not acquired, they face the eternal hockystick graph: the demand from investors to grow exponentially, forever. Even if I say I can start with a business model that is incentive aligned, if my company is successful, this need for growth will eventually force me to turn to more dubious sources, like how Google now tries to build software for military drones.</p>
<p>In addition, when we “avoid perverse incentives”, we are not challenging or changing businesses in our industry that already have perverse incentives. The incentive aligned world that we’d like to imagine has no way to ethically build an Uber, a company incentivized to pay their drivers as little as possible, without overtime, vacation, or health care. This theory is also incompatible with building an Airbnb, a company whose short-term rentals <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/04/research-when-airbnb-listings-in-a-city-increase-so-do-rent-prices">drive up long-term rents for locals</a>. As a theory entirely built around choosing an ethical business model, it has no way to challenge unethical business models that already exist. Like many technological solutions, incentive alignment provides a thin veneer of egalitarianism without actually having to challenge power.</p>
<p>Google is a particularly great case study, since it shows what happens when a startup promises to early employees they are “doing good” through incentive alignment. This promise had enough power to make employees at one of the largest corporations in the world believe their work was countercultural. This kept expectations sky-high, as <a href="https://logicmag.io/the-making-of-the-tech-worker-movement/full-text/">Ben Tarnoff in Logic</a> points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there was another important reason that Google became a hotspot for organizing. Its employees tended to have a more utopian outlook, aptly summarized by its former slogan, “Don’t be evil.” Employees expected executives to put ethical considerations above profit-making. When this expectation was not fulfilled, it created a sense of betrayal that fed a process of radicalization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These disparities between expectations and reality grew and became more visible — <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1141838179936243714">donations</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1285424999256322051">anti-LGBT candidates</a>, close partnerships with <a href="https://logicmag.io/nature/oil-is-the-new-data/">large oil companies</a>, work on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">military drones</a>, and of course, the Andy Rubin payouts.</p>
<p>I was working at Google during the 2018 Walkout for Real Change, a protest over the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html">$90 million payout</a> to a known sexual harasser, attended by more than 20,000 Google employees worldwide. At the walkout, I heard frustration from old-timers and “nooglers” (god help us) alike that they wish they could return to the good old days, back before Google built software for drones, before they fired dissenters and gave massive payouts to sexual harassers. Back when Larry and Sergey were running the place. At a later protest after I quit, my coworkers <a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1197957822778003456">held up signs</a>: “Save Our Culture”.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of tweet from @RMac18 reading &quot;A lot more people at this SF Google employee protest than I thought there would be. Probably about 120ish people gathered to hear from two people that have been placed on leave for allegedly violating company policy.&quot;, one attached photo shows a crowd and the other a pamphlet that reads &quot;Town Hall to Save Our Culture&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/tools_walkout_culture.jpg"></p>
<p>I wonder if what some of us really wanted was a return to the days when we could still believe Google’s work was ethical, back when this dream of incentive alignment was all we needed to believe in the morality of our executives. I am skeptical of this nostalgia; incentive alignment was perhaps a more convincing myth in the early days, but even then it failed to reflect reality. We were protesting payouts from 2013, smack in the middle of this old “open culture” we were asking for a return to. We wanted a return to the old days when Larry and Sergey gave weekly talks, while protesting the Rubin payouts that those two approved. Of course, my sexually assaulted coworkers never had the option of ignorance. The company had always poorly handled sexual harassment and assault, these problems were just hidden to the largely white and male workforce. The myth of incentive alignment was always a myth, as Larry and Sergey themselves point out in their <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#a">1998 PageRank paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly insidious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Larry and Sergey have since retreated from the public eye, but in an unusual arrangement for a public company, still own a majority voting stake. Even if we set aside the perverse incentives with advertising, they can at least use their dictatorial control over the company to ensure we don’t build for military drones, right? Certainly we should find them at fault, but it’s here that we, the employees, are complicit in these “perverse incentives” too. Our compensation in stock is intimately tied to this necessity for exponential growth. We expect our stocks to go up, too. Even in an imaginary world where Larry and Sergey <em>wanted</em> to limit Google’s growth to work only on what they believed to be ethical, the compensation scheme provided to employees would require exponential growth to keep salaries competitive. Startup founders can’t keep their promise of incentive alignment, even if they want to. Our industry has tried it before, and it doesn’t work. Without a radically different approach, the argument in the face of this history boils down to saying existing big company CEOs are just evil, and that our startup has nicer, more ethical people running it. Perhaps our startup can also adopt a nice slogan to represent this, like “don’t be evil”.</p>
<p><img alt="photo of sundar testifying to congress" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/tools_sundar.jpg"></p>
<p>Incentive alignment as an ideology is alive and well today. When Sundar Pichai testified to Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/29/technology/tech-ceos-hearing-testimony">last week</a>, in response to allegations of anticompetitive behavior, he argued Google’s interests were in fact aligned with their small business users. Under oath, he told Congress that whether Google was “building tools for small businesses or platforms like Android, Google succeeds when others succeed.” While we continue to vent frustrations at the large tech companies, many of the folks I know in tech continue to believe in Sundar’s message here. They might be angry about the Rubin payouts and drone software, but still see the core product of search ads as incentive aligned with both users and small businesses. Like Sundar, they highlight how search is an incredible tool for users around the world. If we want to understand the staying power of incentive alignment, …</p></div></div>

August 6, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-first-fullstack-boilerplate/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-first-fullstack-boilerplate/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Configuration of a boilerplate for your newly started projects is a tedious, repeatable job … which you can forget about thanks to <a href="https://github.com/karanpratapsingh">@karanpratapsingh</a>, who has made a full-stack boilerplate following some of the best patterns &amp; practices learned from most-popular codebase and developers he has worked with. All that to make it possible to bootstrap your GraphQL-first app in React with just a couple clicks.</p>
<p>No matter if are starting a simple personal project or enterprise app you are getting a scalable full-stack starter kit following good architecture patterns, which is super significant as your project grows.</p>
<h2>Tech stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>React (with TypeScript)</strong> - the frontend part is powered by React with TypeScript, a JavaScript extension providing types that would save you much time catching errors.</li>
<li><strong>GraphQL (with Apollo)</strong> - as already mentioned at the beginning, this is a GraphQL-first approach using most popular GraphQL implementation - Apollo,</li>
<li><strong>Prisma</strong> - Prisma is an open-source modern ORM that makes database access easy with an auto-generated query builder. In this starterkit its begin used for PostgreSQL but the out is open for suggestions so if you would see other ORM or drivers here just submit a PR,</li>
<li><strong>Jest</strong> - Jest is a <a href="https://jestjs.io/">JavaScript-based Testing Framework</a> working fine with numerous languages and frameworks, among others, React &amp; TypeScript. The boilerplate comes with sample tests that are easily extendable for future modules as simplicity is one of the Jest’s top principles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project architecture</h2>
<p>The library is using yarn workspaces which makes it easier to split the monorepo into packages responsible for a database connection, GraphQL part etc. It makes it really helpful if you choose to split GraphQL into its own set of microservices. The packages are organized as below:</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>If you are ready to start your next GraphQL+React project begin with creating <code>.env</code> files at both <code>backend/.env</code> as well as <code>web/.env</code> following the <code>.env.template</code> files located in those directories. The next step would be installing dependencies. The author recommends using <code>yarn</code> instead of npm as this boilerplate uses <code>yarn workspaces</code> heavily. To run backend &amp; frontend use:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>yarn start:backend
yarn start:web</code></pre></div>
<p>but make sure to provide your own <code>DATABASE_URL</code> rather than default one from <code>.env.template</code> as it might be changed or deleted anytime, as mentioned by the library creator. If you like the idea of GraphQL-first full-stack boilerplate please show its maintainers some love and <a href="https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/fullstack-starterkit">leave a star</a> :)</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596302358014/I12LtIqFL.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Levels of interaction with Docker"></p>
<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596255174293/jg6QyfiZV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Docker Lifecycle"></p>
<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>
<p>For now, if you want, keep in touch with me via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/antonio_lofiego">Twitter</a> and let me know what you think about this guide. I hope you liked your first steps with Docker because it's gonna be a hike!</p>

<h2>Creating our Godot endless runner project</h2>



<p>To get started let’s open up Godot and create our Godot endless runner project like below.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133.png" alt="godot endless runner new project" srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133.png 503w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133-300x243.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133.png 503w, https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133-300x243.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-133.png"><figcaption>godot endless runner new project</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should now have a new empty scene which you can use to bring in your assets. Let’s create a new 2d scene and start building out our basic object for our endless runner game.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png" alt="godot beginner tutorial adding some nodes" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-1.png"></figure>



<p>Go ahead and click on 2d scene. Then rename it to Game like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png" alt="godot beginners tutorial creating our game node in our scene" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png"></figure>



<p>I have a few assets which I created from my inkscape illustration. You can either use your own assets or go to the bottom of this post to get the download link for the assets for this project. If you are going to be using your own assets, the minimum requirement is a object which can be used as an obstacle and an object as a reward. In my case it is is a barrel for the obstacle and a bone for the reward. In this tutorial we will be practicing decoupling of scenes and classes. So I will try and keep the project as clean as possible. </p>



<p>Here are the assets I have in my project just for reference if you are going to be using your own assets.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-3.png" alt="Creating a barrel in our godot game tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-3.png"></figure>



<p>With this I am going to set up a few scenes ahead of time. So let us start setting those up.</p>



<h2>Setting up our scenes</h2>



<p>To start creating scenes click on this plus icon here:</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-4.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-4.png"><figcaption>godot endless runner setting up the scenes</figcaption></figure>



<p>We going to now create a scene for our barrel, bone, player, scrolling background, fixed background. So go ahead and start with the barrel. Here is the setup I am following for the barrel.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5.png"></figure>



<p>A 2d scene as my root node. Which I will rename to Barrel. After that right click and add a child node of type sprite. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-6.png" alt="Godot 2d sprite creation" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-6.png"></figure>



<p>Then drag the barrel image into the texture slot like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-7.png" alt="" width="944" height="110" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20944%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-7.png"></figure>



<p>Now save that scene as Barrel.tscn. So now you might ask why have we not added anything else here yet. Well we want to try and decouple obstacle behavior from this barrel. So that it makes it easier for us to add new items into our game later on. Now do the exact same setup for our bone. Here is what I end up with for the bone. I then save it as Bone.tscn.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8.png" alt="Godot node2d beginners tutorial" width="951" height="132" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20951%20132'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8.png"></figure>



<p>Next let’s look at setting up our backgrounds. I am going to separate the components of the backgrounds as well. As we may want to make them parallax in our game. So we need to set them up as different scenes to make them more versatile for our development.</p>



<p>So here is my setup for the backgrounds. </p>



<p>I will be using a texturerect for both as the root node like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-9.png" alt="Texturerect for endless scrolling background in godot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-9.png"></figure>



<p>For the floor I have called it foreground and dragged the texture in. Be aware that I have changed the stretch mode to tile, so we can wrap our floor when we start scrolling it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-10.png" alt="" width="961" height="167" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20961%20167'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-10.png"></figure>



<p>The same with the background which will live in the back of our game scene. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-11.png" alt="godot beginners tutorial scrolling background" width="948" height="245" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20948%20245'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-11.png"></figure>



<p>So this will allow us to scroll this one if we want to later on. For this tutorial I may or may not add that function. Will see how the game looks when this tutorial has been completed.</p>



<p>So at this point your should now have this. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-12.png" alt="godot endless runner scenes" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-12.png"></figure>



<p>Let’s now create our player. For this I will have another section because we need to setup some of the animation as well.</p>



<h2>Setting up the endless runner player</h2>



<p>To create our player we create another new scene and I use a Node2D as the root node which will be renamed to Player.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png" alt="godot player movement script" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png"><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png" alt="godot player beginners tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-14.png"></figure>



<p>Next I will be adding a animated sprite to the tree by right clicking on the player and adding a new node of type AnimatedSprite.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-15.png" alt="godot animated sprite tutorial - basic animation" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-15.png"></figure>



<p>Now we need to add some animation frames. To do that you can over the right while AnimatedSprite is selected in your tree. Click on the empty in frames here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-16.png" alt="godot endless runner adding animated sprite" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-16.png"></figure>



<p>Then click on new sprite frames.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-17.png" alt="godot endless runner spriteframes" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-17.png"></figure>



<p>Finally click on the SpriteFrame like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-18.png" alt="godot endless runner frame editor" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-18.png"></figure>



<p>The animations box should now pop up at the bottom of the screen now.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-19.png" alt="godot animation frames tutorial" width="703" height="178" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20703%20178'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-19.png"></figure>



<p>First thing we need to do is rename our default animation to Run. So double click on default and rename it to Run like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-20.png" alt="godot endless runner animation naming" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-20.png"></figure>



<p>Now simply drag the sprites into the empty box for the run animation like this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21.png" alt="godot character animation" width="683" height="176" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20683%20176'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-21.png"></figure>



<p>So if you are using my asset pack for this tutorial then that would be dog.png first then dog2.png and dog1.png in the last frame.</p>



<p>We now also need to create a jump animation for our player so to do that. Click on the plus icon next to the bin. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-22.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-22.png"></figure>



<p>Rename that New Anim to jump and drag in dog1.png, dog4.png, and dog5.png in that order. You should end up with this.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="godot infinite runner tutorial animations" width="623" height="185" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20623%20185'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png"></figure>



<p>That is it for the animations for now save the scene as Player.tscn. We are going to do some more work on each scene now to get individual pieces of the game working. Then we will bring that into our game scene to start bringing the game into a working state.</p>



<p>You should now have all these scenes setup and created in your godot project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png"></figure>



<h2>Godot setup endless scrolling background and foreground</h2>



<p>Here is where we will now start moving functionality out into it’s own container. So you would remember that we created these two texturerects in our backgrounds. Well in this section we going to get rid of them. We will then create a generic scrolling background scene which will handle the scrolling for both our backgrounds and any other background we want to add later. You can now easily see how this could speed up our development in the near future if we want to expand on our game. The reason I am showing you this in a godot beginners tutorial is so that you can start off with the mindset of adopting the DRY principle. Where one of the key things are to not repeat yourself by making duplicates of the same function. Create it once and use it everywhere. </p>



<p>So lets see how we going to do this. So first thing we need to do it go into our foreground and backbackground scenes and change the node types to node2d. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-25.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-25.png"></figure>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-26.png" alt="infinite scrolling background basics" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-26.png"></figure>



<p>Save both of those, let us now create our Scrolling Background scene by clicking on the plus.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-27.png" alt="" width="695" height="84" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20695%2084'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-27.png"></figure>



<p>For this we going to click on Other Node. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-28.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-28.png"></figure>



<p>And here we will use texturerect. </p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-29.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-29.png"></figure>



<p>Rename it to ScrollingBackground.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-30.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-30.png"></figure>



<p>For this we will not be adding a texture but we will be setting the stretch mode to Tile. So that when we instance this to another scene we have that setting already set. With this change your stretch mode here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-31.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-31.png"></figure>



<p>Great now we are going to talk about shaders. In Godot we have a shader language that looks similar to most c based languages. It has conditional statements, loops, and much more. Even though it is highly discouraged to use this because the shaders functions in themselves loop over pixels or vertices. </p>



<h2>Godot shaders basics</h2>



<p>Here is a short brief explanation. Shaders mainly execute instructions on the GPU or graphics processor of the device your game runs on. The use of shaders are useful in optimizing games where there is heavy lifting needed where a task can be multithreaded. Shaders execute in this way on GPUs. Shaders also loop through pixels and vertices and manipulate them. So with this in mind we want to use a shader to help us scroll our backgrounds. Now with your ScrollingBackground scene created let’s create a basic shader.</p>



<p>So over to the material section on the right.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-33.png" alt="godot shader tutorial" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-33.png"></figure>



<p>Click on new shader material.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-34.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-34.png"></figure>



<p>Then click on the sphere.</p>

<p>Next click on create new shader in this drop down.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-36.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-36.png"></figure>



<p>Then click on shader and this window should open up at the bottom of your screen.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-37.png" alt="godot endless runner infinite background shader" width="1042" height="256" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201042%20256'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-37.png"></figure>



<p>So you will see the error below asking for the shader type. So a brief explanation, canvas_item executes in 2D games. With this, the first thing we want to do is add a shader type of canvas_item. I am going to give you the full shader code here then will explain it.</p>



<pre><code>shader_type canvas_item;

uniform float scroll_speed;

void fragment() {
	vec2 u = UV;
	u.x += scroll_speed * TIME;
	vec4 col = texture(TEXTURE, u);
	COLOR = col;
}</code></pre>



<p>Shader type is as I have explained earlier. Uniform is a way for us to interact with our shader from the Godot editor. This will allow us to set the scroll speed of our background. The fragment function is part of the fragment shader, this will execute on every pixel in our background. Then inside of that we get the UV co-ordinates of our texture. UV co ordinates in simple terms tell Godot at which x and y a pixel will be displayed. We take that and we add to it on the x axis or horizontal axis and multiply that by time to make it increase over time. Then we sample our texture using our new uv co ordinate and we set it to our color. This will then shift our background on the x axis making it scroll. So save that off.</p>



<p>You can now go in here and you will see scroll speed.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-38.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-38.png"></figure>



<p>Let us set a default of 3.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-39.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-39.png"></figure>



<p>There one more thing you need to do here. This is very important so don’t forget this step. You need to go down to this option and tick it.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-42.png" alt="local scene instancing in godot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-42.png"></figure>



<p>This will ensure you can change the scroll speed for every scene you add scrolling background to. If you don’t then the settings will be shared across all scenes and you will not be able to set unique scroll speeds per scene.</p>



<p>We can now integrate this into our backgrounds. So go over to the Foreground scene and drag ScrollingBackground in there from our FileSystem.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-40.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-40.png"></figure>



<p>Now we can set the properties by dragging our sprites in like before. Here are my settings for both scenes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-41.png" alt="" width="1065" height="542" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201065%20542'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-41.png"></figure>



<figure><img src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-43.png" alt="" width="818" height="587" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20818%20587'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://q5q6q2e3.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-43.png"></figure>



<p>Great so if you have done that correctly you should see two backgrounds scrolling now.  So if you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be no more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A = AA^{\top} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\det(I) &amp;= \det(A^{\top}A) \\
&amp;= \det(AA^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A^{\top}) \\
&amp;= \det(A) \det(A) \\
&amp;= \det(A)^2 \\
&amp;= \det(A^{\top})^2 \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\top}A A^{-1} &amp;= I A^{-1}\\
A^{\top} I &amp;= A^{-1} \\
A^{\top} &amp;= A^{-1} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger}A = AA^{\dagger} = I
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\overline{Av} &amp;= \overline{\lambda v} \\
&amp;= \overline{A} \overline{v} \\
&amp;= A \overline{v} \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} \overline{v} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
v^{\dagger} A v &amp;= \lambda v^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{v}^{\top} A^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (A\overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= (\overline{\lambda} \overline{v})^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda}^{\top} \overline{v}^{\top} v \\
&amp;= \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} v^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq 0$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} A x &amp;= x^{\dagger} \lambda x \\
&amp;= \lambda x^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;\geq 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p><p>

\[x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x = (Ax)^{\dagger} Ax\]

</p><p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
x^{\dagger} (A^{\dagger} A) x \geq 0
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponded singular value of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p><p>

\[A_{m \times n} = U_{m\times m} \Sigma_{m \times n} V_{n \times n}^{\dagger}\]

</p><p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A &amp;= (U \Sigma V^{\dagger})^{\dagger} U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} U^{\dagger}  U \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} I \Sigma V^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A^{\dagger} A V &amp;= V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V^{\dagger} V \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma I \\
&amp;=  V \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma \\
&amp;= \Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma V \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A A^{\dagger} U &amp;= \Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger} U \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|x_i| \cos \theta &amp;= \frac{\langle x_i, w \rangle}{|w|} \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, w \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 &amp;= \langle x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle - \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, x_i \rangle + \langle \langle x_i, w \rangle w, \langle x_i, w \rangle w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle x_i, w \rangle - \langle x_i, w \rangle \langle w, x_i \rangle + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \langle w,  w \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 |w| ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 + \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\text{MSE}(w) &amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} | x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w |^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \big( \langle x_i, x_i \rangle -  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2 \big)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \langle x_i, x_i \rangle - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, …</p></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>As part of my <a href="https://github.com/aknobloch/QtPlex">QtPlex</a> project, I've learned a ton about how computers handle key events at a lower level. Specifically, X11-based systems like most Linux distributions - although many of the concepts carry across operating systems and managers. It occurred to me that a huge amount of this knowledge is just floating around aimlessly in my head, often even eluding myself. So the following article is a stream of consciousness as I free some of that memory in my brain. A mental garbage collection to reallocate resources, if you will.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555532538-dcdbd01d373d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@floriankrumm?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Florian Krumm</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatarekeyevents">What Are Key Events?</h2>
<p>In layman's terms, a key event is just a signal that the user has pressed some button, or combination thereof. How we translate the physical button to the signal is where things get weird.</p>
<p>Each peripheral key, regardless of whether it was sent by a programmable mouse, keyboard or bluetooth headset, eventually maps over to some specific, pre-defined encoding. If you ever make the foolish decision to create a Linux application which listens for a specific key to be pressed, you'll first need to find the code (or codes) which correspond to that key of interest. Peripheral key encoding is like the more annoying step brother of character encoding, and I'd advise you to just stop reading now.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="apassingglanceatkeyevents">A Passing Glance at Key Events</h2>
<p>What system is responsible for defining, handling and emitting key events varies across environments. For most Linux-based systems, we can look to the X Window System, standard eleven, aka X11.</p>
<p>The X Window System standard was first conceived at MIT in the mid-1980's. It set out to provide an open-source and standard way for applications to interact with users. This interaction was mostly through graphical user interfaces, but also defined interactions with peripherals such as keyboards and mice. And this is where the "fun" begins!</p>
<p>On any given system, physical keys on the keyboard map over to specific, pre-defined keycodes. These are relatively dumb values that essentially visualize the keyboard as a matrix. For instance, take the following comparison of German and US keyboards:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://aarondevelops.com/content/images/2020/05/keyboard_comp.png"><figcaption><a href="http://www.farah.cl/Keyboardery/A-Visual-Comparison-of-Different-National-Layouts/">A Visual Comparison of Different National Layouts</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In X11 world, the English 'Z' key would have the same exact keycode as the German 'Y' key, as they are both in the same physical position. These keycodes are single-byte numbers that are baked into the X11 server, and on their own don't do us much good. What we're <em>really</em> after is what is known as keysyms - the logical mapping of keycode events into their "actual" meaning to the end user. These are the events we think of as key strokes, such as space, alt, or even combo-codes like ctrl+c and ctrl+v.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="thehistoryofkeysyms">The History of Keysyms</h2>
<h4 id="thebirth">The Birth</h4>
<p>The most basic of these key event definitions on X11 are "keysyms," defined in <code>keysyms.h</code>. If you have the <code>x11proto-core-dev</code> package on your machine, you can head over to <code>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</code> to take a peek at the source. Look at them, all cute, cozy and orderly! There is absolutely no indication of technical debt or 33-year-old software atrophy to be found.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, just read the <a href="https://github.com/D-Programming-Deimos/libX11/blob/7b21731d6b747176672783ba916aa1a3c49b1024/c/X11/keysymdef.h#L50-L113">multi-paragraph comment at the top of the 2,500 line header file</a>. It tells the treacherous tale of deprecation, Unicode compliance and one-to-many keycode mappings.</p>
<h4 id="theangstyteenyears">The Angsty Teen Years</h4>
<p>The implementation of X11 was, at first, a major battleground in the so-called Unix Wars. However, in the late 90's, a champion arose! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFree86">XFree86</a> took the throne as an open-source port of the X Window System standard to Intel x86, and later many other chips. XFree86 kept the original free license of the X Window System standard, poising it as a clear leader.</p>
<p>Most Linux distributions started to ship with XFree86, which provided a lot of great things. One of those great things was an extended definition of keysyms! You can take a look at the source for this in the <code>XF86keysym.h</code> file in the same directory as the standard <code>keysymdef.h</code> file.</p>
<h4 id="theoldsenileyears">The Old, Senile Years</h4>
<p>At this point, you're probably wondering what cool things that <code>XF86keysym.h</code> brings to the table. Well, nobody really knows! Which is absolutely and horrifyingly hilarious. If you don't believe me, <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/x11proto/tree/XF86keysym.h">pop open the source</a> and read for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XFree86 never properly commented these [and] has removed their mail archives of the period that might have shed more light on some of these definitions. Until/unless we resurrect these archives, these are from memory and usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you just thought that passage referred to XFree86 in the past tense, you are correct! As shocking as it is, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/FAQ#defxfree86">XFree86 fell from grace</a> once they started to restrict contributors, refuse to listen to their userbase and fail to track bugs. Fun fact, it wasn't until 2003 that one of the four people allowed to commit to the source code decided it'd be a good idea to start keeping note of bug reports.</p>
<p>So the community responded like they always do: fork the project and let the original one die. And thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server">X.Org Server</a> was born! And from that moment on, keysym definitions became an orderly affair. Just four additional files and 450 more lines of header definitions...</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://aarondevelops.com/content/images/2020/05/42mlwk-1.jpg"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Key events have an interesting history, and this history has resulted in an increasingly convoluted API. Numerous tools (such as <a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/xev.1.xhtml">xev</a> and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/showkey">showkey</a>) can help you identify, track and trace these events. Unfortunately, this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface once we add things like <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/">MPRIS</a> into the equation. Hopefully this dive into keycodes has been funny, enlightening and made you a bit more curious about the computers we interact with. Happy computing!</p>

Nekervis on Flickr</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p>Epic Systems is putting Madison back in the tech-industry spotlight, this time for its troubling public health and labor practices. As COVID-19 cases mount in Wisconsin, Dane County’s second-largest employer is set to send workers back to its sprawling Verona campus in stages, starting on August 10.&nbsp;</p><p>Employee fears and anger surrounding the return-to-work plan are, at this point, well-established: national and local reporters have <a href="https://twitter.com/lkwhite/status/1290677520078196736?s=20" target="_blank">noted</a> the dozens of messages, calls, and emails they received in response to requests for comment. But employee dissatisfaction has manifested in more than complaints. It has also cracked open an opportunity for collective action in the Madison area’s biggest, most ostentatiously anti-labor private employer.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Epic employees facing down the return-to-work date say they are scared about the health implications of heading back to share physical space with thousands of their co-workers.</p><p>“There’s a person in my household who is at high risk for serious complications from COVID-19 and I am very cognizant of the fact that my actions affect more than just myself,” says one employee, who also has two school-aged kids. Like many Epic workers speaking to the press this week, this employee asked to be cited anonymously, due to fears about retaliation or firing.</p><p>In an August 3 email, company executives addressed people who are parents or facing higher risks of coronavirus-related complications to offer an extended work-from-home period—but only until November 2, at which point employees are told to take a leave of absence without a guarantee of getting their jobs back. In an earlier message, sent on July 1, executives told employees: "If you’re a parent with young children, you will need to use the time between now and your return to campus to make arrangements for childcare so that you can be on campus full-time."</p><p>Of the Epic employees who spoke with <em>Tone Madison</em> this week, even those who are not at personally heightened risk for COVID-19&nbsp; expressed concern on behalf of the community at large.</p><p>“I’m a software developer at Epic, I’ve worked there for over 8 years...it’s disrespectful and risking the health of the entire community,” says another concerned employee, who remained anonymous for fear of reprisal. “We should all understand&nbsp; that personal risk is community risk. And so Epic, by forcing 10,000 people to increase their personal risk, it does risk the whole community.”</p><p>The scheduled plan will have workers populating the medical software company’s sprawling campus over the same period that University of Wisconsin-Madison students prepare to return to their dorms and downtown housing. To justify the rapid return to work, Epic CEO Judy Faulkner has cited the “culture” of the company: “It’s hard (actually, it’s impossible) to retain our culture when we’re working from our homes,” wrote Faulkner in an all-staff email on July 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Workers argue that given the projected course of the virus, there’s no way the company can provide for a safe return to work.</p><p>In Faulkner’s communications with Epic staff, she emphasized the role of individual employees in preventing the spread of COVID-19 on campus: “We ask you to do your part by avoiding bars, attending crowded gatherings, or other places where physical distancing can’t be easily observed.” By placing the responsibility of limiting exposure on individual workers, the company rhetorically absolves itself of the possibility of an outbreak: after all, Faulkner—Epic's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/business/epic-systems-campus-verona-wisconsin.html" target="_blank">eccentric billionaire</a> founder —claimed in the same&nbsp; email, “we’ve been told by many that our campus looks specifically designed to weather an epidemic.”&nbsp;</p><p>Epic is notorious for preventing employees from coming together to advocate for themselves as a group. In the 2018 ruling <em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-285" target="_blank"><em>Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis</em></a>, the United States Supreme Court enshrined the right of employers to force workers into individual arbitration. To work for Epic, employees sign away their rights to file class-action lawsuits against the company. It's now easier for other employers around the country to enforce those kinds of terms: In May 2018, <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-jersey-supreme-court-confirms-20004/" target="_blank">citing the </a><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-jersey-supreme-court-confirms-20004/"><em>Epic v. Lewis</em> SCOTUS ruling, </a>the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that truck drivers attempting to file a collective suit against their employer could be prohibited from doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>In mid-July, a coalition of Epic workers, concerned about the company’s plan to reopen offices, circulated a survey to demonstrate collective disapproval of the plan. The poll yielded hundreds of responses condemning the company’s response to the coronavirus pandemic—but an Epic employee familiar with the survey, who prefers to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal, says that the company ignored the survey results. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/">In a </a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/" target="_blank"><em>CBS News</em></a><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/employees-raise-safety-concerns-with-return-to-work-plans/"> segment that aired Tuesday morning</a>, Epic’s Chief Administrative Officer Sverre David Roang evaded questions about the survey, claiming that he was unaware of complaints surrounding the plan to reopen.&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic, and Epic’s disregard for workers’ concerns, have occasioned a sudden flurry of labor activism at the company. Groups of workers have started organizing with the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers (SMART) Local 565. The local represents workers at several Madison-area companies, including Sub-Zero and Trachte Building Systems, and at a few companies in the Wausau area. IWW, a political affiliation group emphasizing direct action, has likewise supported workers in their fight for better conditions at Epic. The IWW's local activities of late have included <a href="http://captelunion.org/2020/03/18/captel-workers-union-calls-sickout/" target="_blank">working to organize employees at CapTel's call centers</a> in Madison and Milwaukee, and <a href="https://www.tonemadison.com/articles/the-grassroots-response-to-covid-19-in-madison-puts-our-institutions-to-shame" target="_blank">spearheading mutual-aid efforts during the pandemic</a>.</p><p>One first-time organizer among Epic's workers reached a boiling point after the usual channels available to Epic employees failed. “The reason that we reached out to the IWW,” says the worker, who requested anonymity, “is that we basically tried all of the internal avenues to have things change for the better, the work-from-home policies, the response to Black Lives Matter. Epic tells us that we’re supposed to be able to give feedback to whomever we want, and it doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere.”</p><p>“The only reason I am doing something is that it got to a point where my fear of getting fired was outweighed by 'I have to do something,'" this worker says.&nbsp;</p><p>This worker and organizer provided internal emails that outline the supposed benefits of coming back to work. One email that Faulkner sent to staff argues that employees who return to campus will have a better connection to Epic's software and internal employees. “Personally, I’m not willing to go back to work and possibly get sick for a better internet connection,” the worker says.&nbsp;</p><p>One employee in the company’s hosting sector, who has looked into the various union organizing drives, says that organizing at Epic will be a challenge, given the company’s hiring practices and labor structure.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a little bit harder to organize than other places because there’s so many people that are young, straight out of college . . . without any frame of reference for their workplace conditions,” he says. “And there's a lot of&nbsp; anti-union or anti-collective sentiments that the company will work very hard to enforce.”</p><p>In addition to the 2018 SCOTUS ruling, Epic has, in the past several weeks, quashed workers’ attempts to act collectively. In an email obtained by <em>Tone Madison</em>, a company representative explained that an employee’s post questioning the return-to-work plan had been removed from an internal discussion board “per request by upper management.” <a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/health-med-fit/epic-employees-say-coronavirus-concerns-met-with-retaliation-demotions/article_7a7ce63e-4e56-5b57-a7f4-8c4dba286094.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank">Employees also told </a><a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/local/health-med-fit/epic-employees-say-coronavirus-concerns-met-with-retaliation-demotions/article_7a7ce63e-4e56-5b57-a7f4-8c4dba286094.html#tracking-source=home-top-story"><em>The Capital Times </em>this week</a> that on multiple occasions, managers who had expressed concern about the company’s COVID-19 plan faced demotions.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has taken precautions to enable physical distancing on the premises, installing the same airflow systems used in hospitals, and rearranging the main cafeteria to preclude the daily mass gatherings characteristic of pre-pandemic lunchtime at the software company. But Epic's coronavirus response diverges significantly from those of other tech companies, including Alphabet, Google’s parent company, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-keep-employees-home-until-summer-2021-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-11595854201" target="_blank">which will not require workers to return to its Mountain View, California offices until July of next year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the sudden spate of labor coverage at Epic, the medical software company had mostly <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/epic-systems-draws-on-literature-greats-for-its-next-expansion/article_4d1cf67c-2abf-5cfd-8ce1-2da60ed84194.html" target="_blank">drawn attention for its themed campus</a>—an oversized playground paying homage to storybook figures like Alice in Wonderland, Humpty Dumpty, and Harry Potter.&nbsp;</p><p>But with COVID-19 spreading quickly <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/local.htm" target="_blank">in 61 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties</a>, the pandemic highlights the contradiction between Epic’s friendly workplace aesthetic and its disregard for worker safety. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

    <h2 id="title">2020-08-06: Compiler numbers, and why they don't matter</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> recently upgraded their in-base compiler from clang 8.0.1 to <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=159646514207723&amp;w=2">clang 10.0.0</a>. Neat.</p>
<p>One of the things that make measuring binary sizes so difficult (and why, despite using it as a rough metric for <a href="https://github.com/ibara/snakeqr">SnakeQR</a>, I don't consider it a comparative metric) is that your compiler can do a lot behind the scenes that can cause binary sizes to differ. Fortunately for us, we no longer have to worry much about the size of our binaries. But let's compare things just for fun.</p>
We will compare clang 8.0.1 to clang 10.0.0. And because I have the compilers on this machine, let's add in gcc 4.2.1, gcc 8.3.0, gcc 11.0.0.20200723, <a href="http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/">pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/larmel/lacc">lacc 0.0.1</a>. That should give us a wide array of comparisons, though again this should not be considered scientific in any way.<sup id="inline-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> We will use total size in hex as our comparator.
<p>Let's start with crt.o.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>clang 10.0.0</th>
    <th>clang 8.0.1</th>
    <th>gcc 11.0.0.20200723</th>
    <th>gcc 8.3.0</th>
    <th>gcc 4.2.1</th>
    <th>pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</th>
    <th>lacc 0.0.1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>3b</td>
    <td>N/A<sup id="inline-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>All the same. That's good. That means our assemblers are not doing anything fancy behind the scenes. There are four different assemblers being used here: clang 10.0.0 and clang 8.0.1 each have their own built-in assembler, gcc 11.0.0.20200723 and pcc are using GNU as 2.35.50.20200723, and gcc 8.3.0 and gcc 4.2.1 are using GNU as 2.17.</p>
<p>Now let's look at snakeqr.o.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>clang 10.0.0</th>
    <th>clang 8.0.1</th>
    <th>gcc 11.0.0.20200723</th>
    <th>gcc 8.3.0</th>
    <th>gcc 4.2.1</th>
    <th>pcc 1.2.0 DEVEL 20200630</th>
    <th>lacc 0.0.1</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>15e2</td>
    <td>15d0</td>
    <td>16a1</td>
    <td>16dd</td>
    <td>178d</td>
    <td>1bd0</td>
    <td>2509</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Interestingly, clang 8.0.1 generates a smaller object file than clang 10.0.0. Newer versions of gcc produce smaller object code than older versions. pcc is not too terribly behind. And lacc brings up the rear and is noticably worse at producing small object code than the other compilers.<sup id="inline-3"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
</p><p>So what can we draw from this? Probably not much.</p>
<p>clang 10.0.0 is a superior compiler to clang 8.0.1 and brings in support for newer versions of C++ and that is more than worth the potential for larger binaries, which if we're being honest here the 18 byte increase is effectively noise. Newer compilers are able to generate better code, but that had better be true or else there would be little reason to be using a newer compiler. clang and especially gcc have had the benefit of decades of time and generations of programmers and corporations throwing money at them to create high-quality, production-ready compilers. That hardly seems revelatory.</p>
<p>pcc, which has been around since the 1970s, can still hold its own against clang and gcc when it comes to standard C code. That might actually be the big take-away here for me.</p>
<p>And lacc shows us that C is a language small enough and versatile enough that a single person can produce a compiler that honestly puts up respectable numbers against the bigger compilers. That's the other big take-away. If you've ever wanted to write your own C compiler, producing something that you can be proud of and can produce good enough code for modern machines is within the reach of a single person.<sup id="inline-4"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>These comparisons might be interesting to look at but remember not to put any stock in them. Very few of us live in a world where these binary sizes would make or break our systems. There is no "best" compiler and the endeavor to crown one is little more than a distraction. The best compiler is the one that compiles the code you want to run in a time you can live with. Don't be blinded by shiny numbers; you'll no longer be able to see what really matters.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Black neighborhoods pay 20% more in renters insurance.</em></p><p>With the recent Black Lives Matter protests much of society has been re-examining explicit and implicit sources of discrimination against Blacks in America. What are the ways our society and economy has set up harmful policies towards Black citizens?</p><p>Housing and its associated cost has historically played a critical role in institutionalizing racism and segregation. Even insurance companies have historically discriminated against Blacks through processes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a> where by they refused to write policies in certain neighborhoods, thus making housing more expensive or challenging to acquire.</p><p>As an insurance provider ourselves, we wanted to examine data to see how race impacts the price of insurance. We asked: is renters insurance more expensive if you live in a predominantly Black neighborhood than if you live in a predominantly white one?</p><p>We analyzed public data from the California Department of Insurance on how much companies charge for renters insurance in cities across the state. We also analyzed our own pricing for those locations.</p><p>We found the higher the percentage of Blacks living in a zip code or city, the higher the price of insurance on average. Across the industry renters insurance annual premiums were about 20% higher in predominantly Black neighborhoods than predominantly white ones. While we did not find such a correlation in our own prices, we recognize there is a lot of work left to do.</p><h3 id="the-data-and-methodology">The data and methodology</h3><p>Before diving into the results, it’s worth spending a moment on methodology. The <a href="http://www.insurance.ca.gov/">California Department of Insurance</a> requires all insurance companies operating in the state to publicly file the rates they would charge for a set coverage level in a given area. We analyzed this public data using defined coverage limits ($100k liability, $30k personal property, $500 deductible) for the top <a href="https://www.iii.org/table-archive/23446">10 most popular companies</a> in the state and analyzed how much they charged in different zip codes and cities for renters insurance. Using US census data, we’re able to calculate the percentage of the population in those areas that is Black, and see how that correlates with prices.</p><p>This analysis is focused on showing the difference in insurance prices for the same kind of housing that’s in a mostly Black neighborhood versus a mostly white one. Housing discrimination spans all races and ethnicities across our country, however for this research our primary focus is on Black communities in the state of California. </p><p>In this analysis we haven’t identified any causal factors; It’s meant more as a jumping off point for further analysis examining potential causal factors which can range from discriminatory practices based on the racial composition of a neighborhood (i.e. redlining), to other factors that impact pricing like proximity to a fire station.</p><p>So, there’s definitely more work to be done – but we thought it’s important to make a best effort with the messy data we have to start the discussion.</p><h3 id="cost-of-renters-insurance-in-california">Cost of renters insurance in California</h3><p>To begin, let’s look at the average price of renters insurance in California and how much it varies according to the percentage of the population in a zip code that is Black. For context, in California 5.9% of the population is Black, and across the state the average renters insurance policy costs $183 per year.</p><figure><img src="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/bar-chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/bar-chart.png 600w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/bar-chart.png 1000w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/bar-chart.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As shown above, companies charge more for renters insurance in zip codes where there’s a higher percentage of Black residents. If your zip code has more than 20% Black population, the expected annual price for renters insurance would be $210, which is around 20% more expensive than in zip codes where less than one percent of the population is Black.</p><p>Next, let’s turn our attention to the average price of renters insurance across various cities in California and how it varies by the percentage of residents who are Black. The chart below ranks cities in California from most to least expensive annual policies and also shows the percentage of Black residents in that city. (One column represents the average price for the top 10 insurance providers, and next column are average Goodcover prices for those cities. Only cities with over 100k residents where the CA Department of Insurance publishes rates are included.)</p><figure><img src="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/table.png" alt="" srcset="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/table.png 600w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/table.png 1000w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/table.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Across California, renters insurance is most expensive in Berkeley, followed by Oakland and Los Angeles. Each of the top five cities with most expensive renters insurance policies in California have a substantially higher percentage of Black residents than the state average of 5.9%.</p><p>Is there any correlation between the percentage of Black residents in a city and companies charging more for renters insurance?</p><p>Let’s see, the following chart plots renters insurance prices versus percent of population that is Black from the same list of cities as above.</p><figure><img src="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png 600w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png 1000w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/scatterplot-wm-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The chart above shows some correlation between higher prices for renters insurance and the percentage of Blacks living in the city. Virtually every city with a higher rate of Black residents have insurance policies that cost more than the state average.</p><h3 id="examining-our-own-rates">Examining our own rates</h3><p>Our analysis would not be complete if we didn’t also specifically analyze our own rates in the same way. So we looked at how Goodcover would rate for the same policy and location compared to the top 10 insurance companies in the state using the government pricing data. We found a far lower correlation as shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/scatterplot-with-gc-wm-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/scatterplot-with-gc-wm-1.png 600w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/scatterplot-with-gc-wm-1.png 1000w, https://goodcover.ghost.io/content/images/2020/08/scatterplot-with-gc-wm-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Furthermore, doing the same population segment analysis as earlier, our average annual pricing was $91, $91, $94, $92, for zip codes with percentage of Black population of &lt;1%, 1-5%, 5-20%, and 20%+ respectively – a different trend than the increase of price seen for the top 10 companies which resulted in a 20% higher price for areas with the largest Black population. </p><p>Goodcover’s rates were computed and filed with the State of California in 2019, so we were able to evaluate risk as we see it now, rather than inheriting old rating structures and any potential biases. This modern structure has also allowed us to offer significantly better pricing making financial security more accessible and affordable for more people. </p><p>We’re not sure of the causal factors that make renters insurance more expensive for Black neighborhoods. All we can be sure of is that in our own analysis of risk and causal factors of loss we don’t have an answer for why this correlation would exist.</p><h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3><p>In this analysis, we have shown that there’s a wide variation in how much renters insurance costs across California and that prices tend to be significantly higher in predominantly Black neighborhoods.</p><p>However we’ve also shown that from our own analysis of risk, which resulted in Goodcover’s rating, there is no readily evident reason why this correlation exists. Further study is warranted to understand why this is so.</p><p>At Goodcover, we believe it is our responsibility both as a company and as an industry to understand and address our systemic biases. This begins internally – Goodcover is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in our hiring practices, service and pricing. And then there’s more to be done in our industry – we must further examine rating for bias, increase use of digital servicing to remove biases such as <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1078087405281064">linguistic profiling</a>, reduce or eliminate installment fees that penalize policyholders living paycheck to paycheck, and simply lower the cost of renters insurance to make it more accessible for the 56% of Californians who still don’t have it.</p><p>Eliminating pricing disparities because of the composition of a community is attainable, and a right. Our industry needs to keep vigilant in rexaming our processes so we banish discrimination from the ways we serve our policyholders and the public.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>
	Six weeks ago I emailed my <a href="https://sive.rs/list">private email list</a> with a secret link to buy my new books.
</p><p>
	They’re not even officially released yet, but they’ve already sold over $250,000.
</p><p>
	I made 5000 limited edition hardcover copies of each, but those have sold out now.
</p><p>
<strong>
	I’ll admit, it made me ridiculously happy to make $250,000.
</strong>
	I was expecting way less than that, so it was a big surprise.
	I had a spring in my step for days.
</p><p>
	Then I thought about what to do with the money.
	There’s nothing I want to buy.
	Should I put it in an investment account?
	Eh.
	For what purpose?
	I <a href="https://sive.rs/full">don’t want more money</a>.
</p><p>
	So, I decided to donate it to charity.
	Which charity?
	I want to save the most lives.
	So I let <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a> decide.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Yesterday I wired the entire $250,000 to the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a>.
</strong>
	That will buy 125,000 malaria nets, protecting ~225,000 people, averting ~65,000 cases of malaria, preventing ~125 deaths.
</p><p>
	Yeah.
	That’s <a href="https://sive.rs/n">worth doing</a>.
</p><p>
	Afterwards, a friend reminded me that I had just repeated my “<a href="https://sive.rs/232">232 sand dollars</a>” story, so <a href="https://sive.rs/232">go read that</a> if interested.
</p><p>
	You can buy the books now, directly from me.
	They won’t be available anywhere else for a couple more months.
</p>

might have guessed from my previous entries about <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">Vim</a> and <a href="https://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/">Mutt</a> I'm not
averse to spending a few hours to improve an environment I'm going to be
spending tens of thousands of hours in over the next few years, so it shouldn't
be a shock that my keyboard is something I've heavily tweaked.</p>

<p>This post is about what I've done to make my typing experience more pleasant and
efficient.</p>

<p>If you scoff at customization you won't enjoy this post.  What if I have to use
someone else's machine?  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to
use someone else's machine ever since I got an iPhone five years ago.  I <em>like</em>
customizing my machine to save me time.  Yes, there may be some excessive stuff
here, but not only does it make me type faster, it's <em>fun</em>!</p>

<h2 id="s1-the-original"><a href="#s1-the-original">The Original</a></h2>

<p>There have been many, many keyboards produced in the world since the first ones
emerged.  One of the most famous, at least in programming circles, is the <a href="http://world.std.com/~jdostale/kbd/SpaceCadet.html">Space
Cadet Keyboard</a>.</p>

<p>Originally used on Lisp machines and some other systems, it's not a keyboard for
the minimalist.  There are four "bucky keys" (modifier keys): control, meta,
super, and hyper (plus shift, of course).  There are also special keys that let
you type Greek letters and mathematical symbols.</p>

<p>The Space Cadet is an example of a keyboard for someone not afraid to invest
some time to work faster.</p>

<p>It's also absolutely gorgeous.  The color scheme and typography is beautiful.</p>

<p>This is the keyboard I used (loosely) as inspiration when crafting my current
setup.</p>

<h2 id="s2-modern-hardware"><a href="#s2-modern-hardware">Modern Hardware</a></h2>

<p>I've tried a number of modern keyboards in the past few years.  They're all
high-quality and more expensive than the $20 plastic toys that come with
desktops.  But I spend 60 or more hours a week at a keyboard and maybe one hour
a week in my car, so I'm getting pretty good use out of the dollars I've put
into keyboards if you compare them to the cost of my car!</p>

<p>I'll go through the keyboards I've used in chronological order.  I'm not going
to write too much about the basics of mechanical keyboards and switches.  If you
want to learn about that, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/10/the-keyboard-cult.html">this post</a> and <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide">this guide</a> are good places
to start.</p>

<h3 id="s3-apple-wireless-keyboard"><a href="#s3-apple-wireless-keyboard">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a></h3>

<p>For a long time I used <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple wireless keyboards</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-apple.jpg" alt="Apple Wireless Keyboard"></p>

<p>They're light and compact, but still feel extremely solid thanks to their metal
construction.</p>

<p>They also stay really clean because there gaps between keys are tiny, instead of
the funnel-shaped gaps of other keyboard that send dirt straight to the bottom. </p>

<p>They're readily available at any Apple store, and of course they're wireless
which is great.</p>

<p>They also feel exactly like the keyboards on Apple's laptops, so your muscle
memory is perfectly suited to either one if you switch between them often.</p>

<p>Unfortunately typing on them is nowhere near as nice as the rest of the
keyboards in this list.  Apple keyboards have (I think) only 2mm of travel, but
you have to bottom-out the keys to register the keypresses.</p>

<h3 id="s4-das-silent-ultimate"><a href="#s4-das-silent-ultimate">Das Silent Ultimate</a></h3>

<p>The first mechanical keyboard I got was the <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/">Das Silent Ultimate</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-das.jpg" alt="Das Silent Keyboard"></p>

<p>(This photo is actually my Das Clicky since I don't have the Silent any more,
but they're exactly the same externally.)</p>

<p>Compared to the Apple keyboards the switches on the Das Silent (Cherry Brown
switches) feel far softer.  You're not smashing your fingers against metal on
every keypress.</p>

<p>Overall the Das Silent isn't too bad.  It's built like a tank so I have no doubt
it'd last forever.  It also has the option of blank keys, which I prefer.</p>

<p>I didn't stick with this keyboard for long.  First, its glossy finish looks good
when it's in the box and terrible forever after that.  It's way too easy to get
dirty.</p>

<p>Something also just feels "off" about the key switches to me, especially after
I've tried the other boards in this list.  They feel, for lack of a better term,
"mushy" to me.</p>

<h3 id="s5-das-clicky-ultimate"><a href="#s5-das-clicky-ultimate">Das Clicky Ultimate</a></h3>

<p>The next keyboard I tried was the <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/">Das Clicky Ultimate</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-das.jpg" alt="Das Clicky Keyboard"></p>

<p>This is exactly the same as the Das Silent except for the switches, which are
the "clicky" Cherry Blues.  These feel <em>way</em> better to me than the browns.  The
mushiness I described for the Silent is completely gone.</p>

<p>They are not kidding when they say it is loud.  If you're typing a lot expect to
have a constant background noise of clicks.  But to me the sound is soothing,
especially once you get into a rhythm of typing for extended periods.  Your
coworkers might disagree, so tread carefully.</p>

<p>The Das Clicky still has that godawful glossy finish, unfortunately.  After
a while I decided to try out what I had heard people raving about: Topre
switches.</p>

<h3 id="s6-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-2"><a href="#s6-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-2">Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;pid=pdkb400bn">Happy Hacking Keyboard</a> was my next keyboard.  It's much more
expensive than the Dases were, so it was a tough call, but I'm glad I got it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-hhkb.jpg" alt="Happy Hacking Keyboard"></p>

<p>The HHKB uses Topre key switches, which to me feel like Cherry Browns done
right.  There's no "click" like the Blues, but instead of the mush of the
Browns you get a satisfying "thunk" or "sshhhunk" on each press.  It's a great
balance: you have a nice satisfying sound that's less annoying for other people.</p>

<p>The finish on this keyboard is perfect.  It is the most unassuming, elegant,
wonderful matte finish I've seen on any keyboard.  The plastic is just textured
enough to feel solid under your fingers (not slippery like Macbook keys) but not
enough to feel like you're typing on sandpaper.</p>

<p>If you're short on space, or want to carry your keyboard with you, the HHKB is
for you.  It's <em>tiny</em>, but still feels solid and not flimsy at all.</p>

<p>I have two main complaints about the HHKB.  First, there's two spaces on the
bottom row where they could have put a modifier key but didn't.  The space on
the right has the logo, which is fair enough, but the one on the left is simply
blank for no good reason.</p>

<p>My other complaint is the idiotic default placement of the <code>fn</code> key and the
arrow keys.  I don't mind having to use <code>fn</code> to get to the arrows as
a concession to a compact design, but why on earth would you place them so that
you have to chord on a <em>single hand</em> to hit them?</p>

<p>This problem would be completely solved if the <code>fn</code> key were moved from its
current position (right of the right shift key) down to the empty lower-left
corner.  Then you could use your left hand to hold <code>fn</code> while your right worked
the arrow keys, no single-hand contortion required.</p>

<p>So after a while with the HHKB I got sick of the arrow key problem.  I loved the
Topre switches though, so the next choice was pretty obvious.</p>

<h3 id="s7-topre-realforce-103"><a href="#s7-topre-realforce-103">Topre Realforce 103</a></h3>

<p>The Topre Realforce 103UB was my next keyboard, and is the one I'm
still using to this day.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-realforce.jpg" alt="Topre Realforce Keyboard"></p>

<p>I believe the model I bought is now discontinued, but it's been replaced by the
<a href="http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rf104&amp;pid=xf11t0">104UB</a> which is exactly the same except for an extra key on the right
side.  If I could swap my current keyboard for one of those I would.  In fact,
if anyone wants to buy my used 103UB for a bit of a discount I'd be totally
willing to sell it to get the 104UB.</p>

<p>Anyway, this keyboard has a few disadvantages.  First, unlike every other
keyboard here (except the wireless Apple ones) <em>it is not a USB hub</em>.  This
isn't a huge deal (I have external USB hubs), but it did come as a big surprise.</p>

<p>Second, it's big.  Really big.  If you don't have <em>plenty</em> of room on your desk
you might want to look at the <a href="http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rftenkeyless">tenkeyless</a> varieties which
ditch the number pad section to save space.  I have room and I love having
a number pad, so I got the behemoth-sized model.</p>

<p>Also for some reason I can't fathom there's no way to get blank, black keycaps
for this keyboard.  You can get blank Topre keycaps in lime green, pink, yellow,
and lots of other colors, but not a simple black!</p>

<p>Now for the good parts.  This thing is built like a tank.  If you needed to
defend your home from an intruder, it would make an acceptable blunt weapon with
which to do so (and you'd probably be able to plug it right back in and start
typing again).</p>

<p>The finish is the same as on the HHKB (gorgeous), but I have to take a point off
for the non-blank keycaps.  I don't need to look at the keys while I type, so
why marr the luxurious finish with lettering?</p>

<p>The Realforce also uses Topre switches, but it has another trick up its sleeve
that makes typing on it even nicer than the HHKB.  The version I have is the
"variable-weighted" one, which means that the keys under your weaker fingers
take less force to press than the ones under your stronger fingers.  This is
fantastic for long sessions of typing.  Instead of my pinkies getting tired my
fingers seem to all tire out at the same rate now.  Topre does make a "uniform"
version that doesn't have this trick, but I really like variable weight keys
myself.</p>

<h3 id="s8-verdict"><a href="#s8-verdict">Verdict</a></h3>

<p>Right now I'm using the Topre Realforce for my day to day work.  I've fallen in
love with how the Topre switches feel (I prefer them over all the others except
<em>maybe</em> the Cherry Blues for the sound) and the Happy Hacking Keyboard is just
too cramped.  If I were short on space the HHKB would be great, but I have
plenty of room on my desk, so why not make use of it?</p>

<p>Here's a photo of all the keyboards (along with a 13" Macbook Air) so you can
see the differences in size.</p>

<p><img src="https://stevelosh.com/static/images/blog/2012/10/kb-size.jpg" alt="Keyboard Size Comparison"></p>

<p>Now that I've talked about the hardware it's time for the software.  I use OS
X exclusively, so everything I say here is OS X specific.  I'm sure there are
Windows and Linux equivalents somewhere though.</p>

<p>I use three software programs that, together, give me just about unlimited
flexibility in customizing how my keyboard works in OS X.</p>

<p><em>(As with any recipe, if you just want to see how to build the webcam yourself, skip to the <strong>Recipe</strong> section. The following wall of text is just my life story.)</em></p>
<h2 id="my-motivations">My motivations</h2>
<p>I've been thinking about webcams for a while after I read about numerous pieces about <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/laptops-need-better-webcams/">how terrible</a> <a href="https://fossbytes.com/why-are-we-still-using-bad-laptop-webcams-low-quality/">laptop built-in webcams</a> <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-your-laptop-webcam-is-still-a-piece-of-junk-9b57971d8d">are</a> in the day and age of zooming-from-home. People seem to have problems with laptop built-in webcams on the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The webcams that come with your laptops (even the most expensive ones) have terrible picture quality.</li>
<li>They can't be trusted: People put tapes on them. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148">You are advised against doing it, though</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of remedies people came up with for the built-in webcam quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy an external webcam. Cons: They only give marginally better results on picture quality.</li>
<li>Use your phone to do meetings. Cons: Small phone screen, impossible to see shared meeting screens well, impossible to share screens, impossible to access work documents at the same time, limited by the functionalities that the mobile app provides.</li>
<li>Use your phone as a webcam. Cons: Cumbersome software setup, lags.</li>
<li>Use a professional camera + HDMI capture card as a webcam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many "professional" streamers choose the last solution, and I have tried to do it myself too. It took me two months to wait for my $50 capture card from China to arrive. Then when it finally came, I realized this is a very cumbersome setup. First, my camera (a Sony NEX-5R) cannot output a "clean" HDMI output (i.e. without the GUI elements). The only way to get rid of that stupid overlay is to buy another newer camera (say, a Sony A7 is $500+ used). Second, the camera does not charge or stay charged on USB, so I have to buy another dummy battery that feeds from a DC source. Third, this setup is not portable.</p>
<p>Moreover, none of the above solutions allow us to trust, control, and improve on them (At least, physically disconnecting them solves the privacy concern, which isn’t something you can do with a laptop built-in camera).</p>
<h2 id="the-raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera">The Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera</h2>
<p>So I set out to build a webcam of my own. Recently, I noticed that the Raspberry Pi Foundation released a high-quality camera, which is a fantastic candidate. It's a professional camera with a very big sensor and an assortment of interchangeable lenses. Being in the right hands, this can be a very powerful tool to achieve many things. Can it be a webcam to use with my ordinary computer though?</p>
<p>I know it is possible to stream the webcam over the network, and then use a computer to turn the network stream back to a virtual webcam. However, because this setup depends on the operating system, the setup is not portable. It also introduces lags which makes the voice trails behind the images.</p>
<p>So in short, I want the Pi Camera to appear as just an ordinary USB webcam to my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/picam_hw.jpg" alt="Pi Cam"></p>
<p>With a bit of googling, I learned that it is possible to make the Pi appear as a USB webcam! There is a mode on the Pi 0 USB port called <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget">USB gadget mode</a>, which makes that port a guest port for the system it's plugged in to. I got a good start with <a href="http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-zero-with-pi-camera-as-usb-webcam/">Dave Hunt's post</a>. However, there are things to be desired with his software solution. First, it uses Raspbian as a base, which means you have a writable root, and an abrupt disconnection of power (we will do that with a webcam) will cause filesystem corruption. Second, the camera takes a long time to start. Those are the two main barriers to this approach: It works as a hack, but it works less well as a solution you'd depend on.</p>
<p>So, I set out to build a more robust firmware for the project. The following is the documentation of what I did to get the firmware working, and I think what I went through can be helpful if you want to roll your firmware to do things you'd like a dedicated embedded firmware for your Pi 0, too.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-webcam-embedded-firmware-with-buildroot">Building a webcam embedded firmware with Buildroot</h2>
<p>One of the tools that I grew fond of recently is Buildroot. Buildroot is a framework/tool to allow you to roll out your own Linux OS/distribution for embedded devices. It powers <a href="https://github.com/flutter/buildroot">a couple of</a> <a href="https://github.com/teslamotors/buildroot">big</a> <a href="https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/buildroot">projects</a>. So I set out to build my firmware with Buildroot.</p>
<p>I plan to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the initial bring-up and get the baseline firmware with busybox working.</li>
<li>Get the firmware to connect to my Wi-Fi network and enable SSH access.</li>
<li>Do all the customizations to bring up the UVC webcam.</li>
<li>Disable Wi-Fi and SSH access.</li>
<li>Add optimizations to protect the device from abrupt power disconnects.</li>
</ul>
<p>For step 1, I followed the tutorial on <a href="https://armphibian.wordpress.com/2019/10/01/how-to-build-raspberry-pi-zero-w-buildroot-image/">ARM fever</a> to have to build a baseline image. Except having to tweak some wireless issues so I could remotely debug the Pi 0 via SSH, the tutorial was spot-on. I knew if the Pi 0 only USB OTG port was in peripheral (gadget) mode, it would have been impossible to connect a USB ethernet dongle to it, so SSH-over-wireless was essential. The package for enabling the SSH access to the Pi is dropbear. Getting a buildroot Pi working with dropbear took me a night.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/showmewebcam.png" alt="Buildroot menuconfig"></p>
<p><em>The very helpful menuconfig system that comes with buildroot</em></p>
<p>Next, it looked to me that a simple sysv-init system was going to be a growing pain. I don't know how to exactly deal with an udev system that the UVC-webcam project assumes, so I switched the init system to systemd which gives me udev automatically. But this change to systemd changes a lot of how networking is done, so getting back a console was quite frustrating. There are a couple of ways you can get a root shell to the Pi: Via <code>ttyACM0</code> (the 40 pin serial headers, which I don't have soldered), via the HDMI console (<code>tty1</code>), or the USB port in gadget mode (<code>ttyGS1</code>), or via SSH (the issue was that get wireless and wired networking was not functional). The issue was that I wasn't sure of what parameters could be used to set them up when none of the venues were working. Without a way to see what wasn't working by looking at the logs or a way to fix issues on the fly, the job became significantly harder. I learned that my <a href="https://gist.github.com/htruong/7df502fb60268eeee5bca21ef3e436eb">chroot-to-pi script</a> helped debug boot issues. After seeing the Pi failing to give me the console, I could still chroot to the SD card and call <code>journalctl</code> to see what went wrong in the last boot with the script. After a while I learned of the names of the device and what went wrong, I was able to get a login prompt via the HDMI console. Once I got in the barebone Pi working with systemd, it became quite a bit easier to set up the serial console on the rest of the interfaces.</p>
<p>Then, I did quite a bit of reading on how to <a href="https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html">set up an external buildroot tree</a>. This step is to avoid having to mangle between the buildroot tree and my system. I added the UVC-webcam package to my tree, that was very simple.</p>
<p>Then the rest was just fixing things and adding boot params in the right places until the whole system worked. The last part was to make the filesystem read-only. That task was done automatically with the rootfs being squashfs. This broke a couple of services at startup that assumed a writable rootfs, but that was not hard to fix – mounting <code>/var</code> as a <code>tmpfs</code> solved the issue.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to remove all the networking support that I added for debugging purposes and just set up the serial access on the USB gadget interface.</p>
<p>The camera boots very quickly in 13 seconds. We can even get root on the webcam by logging in the serial interface presented on the Pi at 115200 baud as <code>root:root</code>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/showmewebcam1.png" alt="Root"></p>
<p><em>Now you can have root on your webcam too!</em></p>
<h2 id="quality-of-the-pi-webcam">Quality of the Pi Webcam</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/webcam.jpg" alt="Webcam"></p>
<p><em>Built-in Dell XPS13 2019 webcam</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/iphone.jpg" alt="iPhone"></p>
<p><em>iPhone SE 2 front camera</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/camera.jpg" alt="Camera"></p>
<p><em>Sony NEX-5R via capture card</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.tnhh.net/assets/posts-images/showmewebcam/picam.jpg" alt="Camera"></p>
<p><em>Pi Camera via Show-me Webcam</em></p>
<p>For my untrained eyes, the quality of the Pi cam is way better than a laptop webcam but a little bit worse than a dedicated camera. It does bokeh very well and has a fixed focus so I would consider it a plus rather than a minus. The camera outputs a consistent 30fps on Windows and Linux, but it does not work on macOS <a href="https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam/issues/1">for some reason</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose it is possible to improve the firmware/software even more. For example, we can make it so the webcam auto-pans to the face. Or maybe we can warn the user when the webcam is out of focus. Or maybe we can even replace the background. However, those are the niceties that can be added later.</p>
<p>If you'd like to take on the adventure with the current firmware, build it yourself, or contribute to the project, please head to the <a href="https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam">project repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi 0 W (I have not tested with the Pi 0 non-Wireless)</li>
<li>Pi 0 W Camera Ribbon (comes with the Pi 0 camera case or you can buy a longer one somewhere else, the stock one that comes with the camera very likely will not work).</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi Camera or Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera</li>
<li>A micro SD card with at least 64MB of storage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assemble the camera.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam/releases/">Download the show-me webcam binary release</a>.</li>
<li>Download and use Etcher to write the image to the SD card.</li>
<li>Use the USB data port (the one in the middle of the Pi, not the one on the edge) to connect to a computer.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>

<p>This project is more of an exercise on embedded and open-source hardware first and a secure webcam second. I even allow root access from the host computer with a well-known password. Perhaps that's not something you would want a secure webcam to do. With the root prompt, an SD card, and a wireless-capable chip and no integrity checking, it only takes a bit of slip-up for the webcam to work against you. Please be mindful of where you plug the webcam to and who gets physical access to it. Even when root console access is disabled, someone can just as easily swap the firmware on the card when they get physical access to it. Please keep in mind that "with great power comes great responsibility." On the bright side of the problem, we should enjoy living in the day and age of being able to write a webcam firmware ourselves. I don't think it was ever possible before.</p>

Well, let's break down those three markets (Search, Streaming, Mobile).</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/do-be-evil-6ba993531a7046106f481b038b7ed98b.jpg" alt="The classic Google slogan &quot;Don't be evil&quot;, except the end of the &quot;don't&quot; is crossed out so it says &quot;Do be evil&quot;" data-identifier="do-be-evil"></p><h2>Search</h2><p>Google's estimated market share for search traffic globally is 92.16% <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>.

Google then uses this money to purchase exclusivity agreements with the likes of Apple (just two years ago it was announce that Google would be paying $12 billion US to Apple to remain the default search engine on Safari in 2019 <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/09/29/google-apple-safari-search-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a> at a cost of roughly $10 per user).</p><h3>How does Google abuse Search?</h3><p>If you ask the average user how Google search works, they'd probably say "it just searches for your search term across the web", but what they probably don't know is that is just the tip of the iceberg. Other dimensions of search include:</p><ul><li>what kind of users go to that websites (and does the user searching fit that profile)?</li><li>how much traffic does the website get?</li><li>how relevant the content is to the search term (SEO magic)?</li><li>and, most importantly, does this website fit an acceptable narrative?</li></ul><p>There's certainly an argument to be made for suppressing some search results, such as pro-authoritarian sites (e.g. communist or fascist), extremely fringe conspiracy, illegal pornography, or bomb-making instructions. Advertisers probably don't want their ads next to those results. Rightly or wrongly, Google is already suppressing content from such websites (though, they're probably still indexing them).</p><p>If Google can suppress fascist content from sites like Stormfront (prominent white-supremacy forum), then who is to say which content they can or cannot suppress? Breitbart is a well-known right wing news site that has had their content <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/07/28/election-interference-google-purges-breitbart-from-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost entirely purged</a> from Google search results (as evidenced by the "search engine visibility" chart below).</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/breitbart-visibility-index-7479c89645b960fee2d841dfa4f1574d.jpg" alt="Search engine visibility index for Breitbart.com shows significant increase in visibility leading up to the 2016 presidential election with a sharp drop in mid 2017" data-identifier="breitbart-visibility-index"></p><p>You don't have to agree with them politically to see that Google is applying different standards to conservative content than to more liberal content. I don't visit Breitbart, I don't read their articles, and frankly I don't give a shit what they have to say, but I believe in a free and open internet. If you believe in a free and open internet then you have to agree this is wrong. During the cold war, anyone who didn't follow the extreme protectionist beliefs of the time <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/red-scare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were shouted down as communists</a> (Even Martin Luther King Jr. was dismissed as a communist by J. Edgar Hoover). This same thing is happening now, but the buzz word is different. The new weaponised word is "Nazi". If time had elapsed differently, I have no doubt that it would be left-wing websites suppressed in search results, and that still wouldn't be okay.</p><p>There's plenty of evidence to suggest that Google is manually making these decisions to block conservative websites, however, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai denied that they manually censor websites at the recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/29/tech-hearings-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-amazon-jeff-bezos-apple-tim-cook-google-sundar-pichai-congress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Congressional antitrust hearing</a> except for in cases where there are legal requirements or copyright issues. I don't buy that, personally.</p><h2>Streaming</h2><p>When YouTube was founded it was facing severe scaling problems (because video processing and streaming is extremely expensive). Fortunately for them, Google saw potential in the platform and purchased the company for $1.65bn in Google stock, and their money issues were over. Google was throwing money into scaling the platform, and it was experiencing great growth. This success turned out to be a major problem for the YouTube, because, from the time it was purchased it has been making a loss. In recent years, YouTube has become profitable, however, without the bottomless pockets of Google behind it, they never would have been able to accomplish this. What incentive could Google have to take losses year after year on YouTube? Well, it turns out user data is particularly delicious. Mastercard's CEO has infamously said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/mastercard-boss-just-said-data-is-the-new-oil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"data is the new oil"</a>. I personally can't wait for Facebook, Amazon, and Google to become para-military organisations in the up-coming data wars.</p><p>YouTube has essentially bullied their way into market dominance using Google's bottomless pit of money. This is problematic because it allows failing companies to cheat death. Just like a bottom-feeding fish,latching onto a whale shark and hitching a ride. As I mentioned before, video streaming is extremely expensive, so it makes sense that great cloud infrastructure is a prerequisite to success. Well, big surprise, Google offers world-class commercial cloud infrastructure with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)! Do you suppose YouTube is paying full price for their infra?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/google-shark-ad4f1bd39e618a72413dc9456fb01ebc.jpg" alt="A whale shark with small fish adhered to the top of it. YouTube, Google Play, and Google Plus logos are superimposed on the small fish heads" data-identifier="google-shark"></p><p>So, when you see a headline that says "<a href="https://bgr.com/2020/07/30/google-one-free-phone-backup-ios-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop paying for iCloud – Google One will now back up your iPhone for free</a>". Before obeying the shill who wrote it, you should ask yourself, "How can a company afford to give away so much storage space for free?". Well, they can't. Google simply obscures their losses with the immense revenue from Google Ads in the profit/loss statement at the end of each quarter. For more reading about this topic, Tim Bray has a fantastic article called <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"Break up Google"</a>.</p><h2>Mobile</h2><p>This article is already becoming too long, so I'm just going to cover mobile quickly. As Tim Bray mentions in the article above, Android isn't really a business. The only real non-ad revenue they have is from the commission they get from app purchases and licensing fees from OEMs (e.g. Samsung, Huawei, LG). How, then, are they able to sustain hundreds of highly paid engineers and all the other non-technical staff required to support the system?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/android-ios-market-share-aa0b256bae300e426ecb38c8ef842165.jpg" alt="A map of the world with Android vs iOS market share. iOS is most dominant in first-world countries, whereas Android dominates emerging nations" data-identifier="android-ios-market-share"></p><p>Above is a map of Android vs iOS market shares. You can see that iOS pretty much only has the dominant market share in first world countries (like USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Japan). Most of the emerging countries in the world are strongly in favour of Android because, unlike Apple, the OS is not restricted to a particular device. So, countries like India (where the number of smart-phone users has increased sharply from 199 million in 2015 to 401 million in 2020 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source</a>) that mostly purchase low-cost phones (e.g. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo). Emerging markets are extremely important to companies like Google partly because these countries are easier to exploit because they don't have strong legislation to protect users from predatory advertising, anticompetitive tactics, or data privacy. This is why I speculate that Mastercard is scrambling to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2020/05/06/financial-inclusion-helps-refugees-move-from-aid-recipients-to-earners-and-tax-payers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connect refugees to the global payment network</a> (Remember that quote from the Mastercard CEO: "Data is the new oil") and, indeed, why Mastercard <a href="https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/08/patreon-and-mastercard-ban-robert-spencer-without-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced Patreon to ban Robert Spencer for his anti-refugee sentiment</a>.</p><p>Again, regardless of whether you agree with someone's political leaning or rhetoric, I shouldn't have to explain why it's ludicrous for people to believe that faceless, soulless corporations such as MasterCard or Google give two fucks about moral righteousness when their only servant is a number ticker on the Nasdaq website.</p><h2>Closing

alt="Google DNS logo" data-identifier="google-dns"></p><p>To be clear, I'm not accusing Google of storing DNS logs or associating that with specific users (they claim that they don't in their terms of service), however, I think it's unreasonable to think that they wouldn't be capable of that. I also wouldn't put it past them to lie in terms of service considering their recent run-ins with the law (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-eu-fines-google-1-7-billion-for-blocking-advertising-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.7bn fine for anti-competitive behaviour</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$170m for violating children's privacy on YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/21/18191591/google-gdpr-fine-50-million-euros-data-consent-cnil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 million euro fine for GDPR violations</a>).</p><p>$2bn doesn't matter to Google. It's a drop in the bucket, especially considering they would probably be able to freely harvest user data for months or even years before they're caught and slapped on the wrist. If a single user's search data is worth upwards of $10 a year (see the Safari Google default search engine deal) for Google, then the complete logs of their browsing history would be quite juicy indeed.</p><p>Okay, so that's verging on conspiracy theory I suppose. Maybe Google DNS will remain clean. How about you get a Google® Nest™ WiFi mesh router and let them inspect all of your web traffic that way?</p><p><img src="https://lukeboyle.com/static/nest-c6cc34d5b4043b24d7c12a3223cc9ae4.jpg" alt="Google Nest Wifi Router product photo" data-identifier="nest"></p><p>Or perhaps you want to buy the new Pixel and give them advanced analytics about how you use your phone (<a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-privacy-lawsuit-android-apps/374952/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy class action lawsuit</a>), everywhere you go (Location History), how much physical activity you do (Google Fit), every article/video you engage with (Chrome), everything you buy (Google Pay - and incidentally, how much disposable income you have, so they can better target more relevant ads to you). All of these "services" are simply a ruse so that Google can build an extremely accurate profile about the type of consumer you are and target you with more advertising to turn you into a soulless consumer.</p><p>I don't want these people to also be the arbiters of what content I should or should not be able to see online.</p><h2>Actual closing thoughts</h2><p>Well that was pretty depressing.
