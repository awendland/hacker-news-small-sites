				<p>When it comes to modern web application development, MongoDB is the king. If you are a full stack programmer, you hear about MERN or MEAN stacks every day. The <b>M</b> is in every one of them and it stands for MongoDB. The free and open source community version of MongoDB powers a large number of Web applications. From its humble beginnings in 2007, MongoDB has come a long way. It is the primary product behind the company MongoDB Inc. with over 10 billion dollars in market capitalisation. Like many other products before and after, online advertising was the key catalyst behind the vision and development of MongoDB. The story of MongoDB is an interesting one and in this article, I will take you on a journey through the MongoDB land and its history.</p>
<h2>The Idea of the Humongous Database – The Beginnings</h2>
<p>The story of MongoDB has its beginnings much earlier than 2007. In 1995, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Merriman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwight Merriman</a> and Kevin O’Connor created the famous online advertising company DoubleClick. Kevin Ryan joined the team soon after(Dwight and Kevin later cofounded 5 companies together – Gilt, 10gen, Panther Express, ShopWiki and Business Insider). DoubleClick soon took off and within a few years it was serving as much as 400,000 ads/second. Such large scale traffic was not anticipated by the relational database technologies available at that time. Configuring relational databases for such scale also required substantial amount of money and hardware resources. So Dwight(who was the CTO at the time) and his team wrote custom database implementations to scale DoubleClick for the increased traffic. In one of his <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early talks on MongoDB</a>, Dwight talks about getting a network hardware with serial number 7 and wondering whether it will work! This was even before the invention of load balancers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-people.jpg" width="300px" alt="People behind MongoDB" title="People behind MongoDB">In 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Horowitz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliot Horowitz</a> joined DoubleClick R&amp;D division as a software engineer immediately after his college. Within 2 years he left DoubleClick to start ShopWiki along with Dwight. Both of them realised that they were solving the same horizontal scalability issues again and again. So in 2007, Dwight, Eliot and Kevin Ryan started a new company called 10gen. 10gen was focused on creating a PaaS hosting solution with its own application and database stack. 10gen soon got the attention of the venture capitalist Albert Wenger (Union Square Ventures) and he invested $1.5 million into it. This is what <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2008/07/10gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Wenger wrote in 2008 about the 10gen investment</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>
Today we are excited to announce that we are backing a team working on an alternative, the amazingly talented folks at 10gen. They bring together experience in building Internet scale systems, such as DART and the Panther Express CDN, with extensive Open Source involvement, including the Apache Software Foundation. They are building an open source stack for cloud computing that includes an appserver and a database both written from scratch based on the capabilities of modern hardware and the many lessons learned in what it takes to build a web site or service. The appserver initially supports server side Javascript and (experimentally) Ruby. The database stores objects using an interesting design that balances fast random access with efficient scanning of collections.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Albert was refering to as “the database with interesting design” was in fact MongoDB. Rapid development on the new database was undertaken from 2007 to 2009. The <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/e73188b5512c82290a4070af4afddac20d0b981e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first commit of the MongoDB database server by Dwight can be seen here</a>. The core engine was written in C++. The database was named MongoDB since the idea was to use it to store and serve humongous amount of data required in typical use cases such as content serving. Initially the team had only 4 engineers(including Dwight and Eliot) and decided to focus just on the MongoDB database instead of the initial PaaS product. The business idea was to release the database as an open source free download and offer commercial support and training services on top of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/v1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB 1.0 was released</a> in February 2009. The initial version focused on providing a usable query language with document model, indexing and basic support for replication. It also had experimental version of sharding, but production ready sharding clusters were available only in version 1.6 released a year later.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mongodb-user/X0Le3mBel2I/discussion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Dwight responded to a question</a> on the suitability of Mongo for a highly scalable system (MongoDB user group – September 2009),</p>
<blockquote><p>
For horizontal scaling, one would use auto-sharding to build out large MongoDB clusters.  This is in alpha now, but if your project is just getting started, it will be in production by the time you need it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Early MongoDB Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>In the early years, the basic design principles behind MongoDB development were the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick and easy data model for faster programming – document model with CRUD.</li>
<li>Use of familiar language and format – JavaScript/JSON.</li>
<li>Schema less documents for agile iterative development.</li>
<li>Only essential features for faster development and easy scaling. No join, no transactions across collections.</li>
<li>Support easy horizontal scaling and durability/availability (replication/sharding).</li>
</ul>
<p>In his ZendCon 2011 presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOOQJpGu1kY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“NoSQL and why we created MongoDB”</a>, Dwight talks about these principles in detail. Around <a href="https://youtu.be/hOOQJpGu1kY?t=2408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42 minutes mark</a>, there is also an interesting discussion on the difference between replication and sharding. As the database server code matured and once MongoDB hit the mainstream, many of these principles were obviously diluted. Latest MongoDB server versions support joining to some extend and since MongoDB 4.2, even distributed transactions are supported!</p>
<h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
<p>Before we get into detailed MongoDB history and how it evolved over the years, let us briefly look at what exactly it is!</p>
<p>MongoDB is a document based NoSQL database. It can run on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and the open source version is available as a free download. MongoDB stores data entities in a container called collection and each piece of data stored is in a JSON document format. For example, if a customer submits an online order, the entire details of that order (order number, order line items, delivery address etc.) are kept in a single hierarchical document in JSON format. It is then saved to a collection named “customer_order”.</p>
<p>MongoDB also comes with a console client called MongoDB shell. This is a fully functional JavaScript environment using which you can add, remove, edit or query document data in the database.</p>
<h2>MongoDB Architecture</h2>
<p>The following MongoDB architecture diagram provides a high level view of the major components in the MongoDB server.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-architecture.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB Architecture Diagram" title="MongoDB Architecture Diagram"></p>
<p>MongoDB currently offers <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drivers for 13 languages</a> including Java, Node.JS, Python, PHP and Swift. The storage engine MMAPv1 is removed since version 4.2. The encrypted storage engine is only supported in the commercial enterprise server.</p>
<p>The beauty of MongoDB is that using the same open source free community server you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a simple single machine instance suitable for most small applications.</li>
<li>Run a multi-machine instance with durability/high availability suitable for most business applications.</li>
<li>Run a large horizontally scaled cluster of machines(shard cluster) handling both very large sets of data and high volume of query traffic. MongoDB provides automatic infrastructure to distribute both data and its processing across machines. A typical use case would be running a popular ad service with thousands of customers and millions of impressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagrams show various options available for running MongoDB instances.</p>
<h2>Single Server/Fault Tolerant Setup</h2>
<p>For small applications, a single server setup is enough with frequent data backups. For installations that require fault tolerance, a replica set implementation can be done. In the fault tolerant deployment, usually there are 3 or more MongoDB instances. Only one of them work as the primary instance and if it fails, one of the other 2 secondaries takes over as the primary. The data is identical in all instances.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment1.jpg" width="800px" alt="Single server/fault tolerant setup" title="Single server/fault tolerant setup"></p>
<h2>Shard Cluster for Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>For a large database with both horizontal scalability and fault tolerance requirements, a MongoDB shard cluster is configured. As can be seen from the diagram below, minimum recommended number of machines for a fault tolerant shard cluster is 14! Each fault tolerant replica set in this case handles only a subset of the data. This data partitioning is automatically done by MongoDB engine.<br>
<img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-deployment2.jpg" width="800px" alt="Shard cluster with partitioned data" title="Shard cluster with partitioned data"></p>
<p>When you download the latest version of MongoDB (4.4) and extract it, you will find that it contains only the following 3 main files,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>mongo</b> – MongoDB shell for interacting with your server using JavaScript based commands.</li>
<li><b>mongod</b> – The MongoDB main executable. This can run as a single database instance, as a database member of a sharded cluster or as a configuration server of a sharded cluster.</li>
<li><b>mongos</b> – A router application only needed for sharded horizontally scaled cluster of database servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a mac machine, the total size of these 3 executables is around 150MB. These are the only components you need for any type of MongoDB deployments! In a world of bloated software, this is a welcome change! This simplicity and elegance is what makes MongoDB so powerful and reliable.</p>
<h2>Evolution of MongoDB (2009 to 2020)</h2>
<p>MongoDB 1.0 was released in February 2009 and it had most of the basic query functionalities. MongoDB 1.2 was released in December 2009 and it introduced large scale data processing using map-reduce. Realising that MongoDB has good potential, 10gen quickly ramped up the team. MongoDB 1.4 (March 2010) introduced background index creation and MongoDB 1.6 (August 2010) introduced some major features such as production ready sharding for horizontal scaling, replica sets with automatic failover and IPv6 support.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quickprogrammingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mongodb-timeline1.jpg" width="800px" alt="MongoDB 2009 to 2013" title="MongoDB 2009 to 2013"></p>
<p>By 2012, 10gen had 100 employees and the company started providing 24/7 support. MongoDB 2.2 release(August 2012) introduced aggregation pipeline enabling multiple data processing steps as a chain of …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Imagine a computer-based system visualizing your thoughts and secret thoughts; yes, it's possible now by artificial intelligence assistance. Recent advancements in hardware innovation have re-energized technology. It becomes more accurate, authentic, can produce better sound, accurate visualization, and understanding of the location. Outstanding computer processors support computer to make a decision, plan outputs and don't repeat the mistake as they learn from it. The four scientists in Kyoto at Kyoto University did an exceptional experiment that exceeds the global expectations about such a dreamy truth. </p><p>Tomoyasu Horikawa, Guohua Shen, Yukiyasu Kamitani, and Kei Majima recently published their <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf">results in a paper </a>on a scientific research platform &nbsp;BioRxiv. They have done their experiment in ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories. Their study mainly exposes the decoding of human thoughts using an artificially intelligent system. &nbsp;The artificial intelligence system becomes so smart and real to duplicate human minds and show what they're thinking in their minds. &nbsp;Now scientists are successful in developing the next phase of AI machine, which uses human psychology. It is a leading technology from science fiction to merely science phenomena.</p><p>Below video is demonstration of Tomoyasu’s work. </p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YrO1v7-KcXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h3 id="machine-learning-is-helping-human-beings"><a href="https://thinkml.ai/artificial-intelligence-is-helping-common-people/">Machine Learning is helping human beings</a> </h3><p>Machine learning is in use since many years ago in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. It helped generate a visual impact of human thinking in the form of binary mages or geographic shapes. The images obtained are of simple shapes or pixels. However, another prediction that the human brain thinks in unique patterns of image creation; different thinking levels, either with simple or complex components.</p><p>The idea of processing human thoughts is not new as we can see 1950s videos where doctors used to put contraptions on the human brain. It helps them to decipher the thoughts always running in their patient's minds. A British Serial <strong>Quatermass and the Pit </strong>shows a similar technique to translate the alien's thoughts.</p><p>The scientists from the United States, China, and Japan utilize this fantasy to change it into reality. They use <strong>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </strong>strategy for better measurement of brain activity. The deep neural networks involved in replicating human brain functioning procedure.</p><h3 id="the-emergence-of-artificial-people-with-machine-learning-system">The emergence of Artificial People with Machine Learning System</h3><p>Machines come with consciousness and result in developing a direct relationship between humans and machines. The day is coming when robots not only talk but can laugh, fight, and be cruel with the power of advancement in technology. Some research laboratories are busy making a force that can sense its surrounding environment and show response according to it. They sense human thoughts running in their minds and visualize to others. It's beneficial to know and see the thoughts of those quality people who are extraordinary but can't speak.</p><p>Alan Turing said:</p><blockquote>‘’If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, it is as intelligent as a human being.’’</blockquote><h3 id="is-it-telepathy-or-something-advanced">Is it Telepathy or Something Advanced?</h3><p>The whole world is excited about the news of AI reading minds, but the reality is somewhat not as same as appearing to us. Machine learning is still unable to detect rightly what we think, feel, desire, wish, or need at a specific time. The science is aiming to decipher the images that subjects see for a period. Thus, machine learning uses a reconstruction of a visual filed algorithm for a visual demonstration of thoughts.</p><p>In the last years, scientists strive to create a system that can judge images based on their shapes, characters, and letters when a subject’s mind view them.</p><h3 id="kyoto-university-research-by-four-scientists">Kyoto University Research by Four Scientists</h3><p>The advances in the development of artificial intelligence also use a <strong>deep neural network </strong>to decode human thoughts. &nbsp;They aimed to develop a method that not only deciphers the images but also regenerate the same one. Therefore, the four efficient scientists at Kyoto University utilized the BioRxiv platform and <strong>Deep Neural Networks (DNN)</strong> as a proxy to share their findings of thought decoding. These neural systems help decode images of thoughts in the human brain and produce a visual prediction that resembles a person's thinking.</p><p>More generalized; the system should visualize the image about which its system is not trained previously after decoding the thoughts. &nbsp;It can see or covert human thoughts into images.</p><h3 id="how-does-ai-can-visualize-our-thinking-process">How Does AI Can Visualize our Thinking Process? </h3><p>The basis of this system is to scan the human brain deeply. For this purpose, the scientists introduce fMRI (Functional MRI) that scans the brain's core over traditional MRI that involves only monitoring brain activity. The unusual behavior of fMRI is its ability to track <strong>blood flow </strong>to the brain and <strong>brainwaves. </strong></p><p>It takes data from the scan and interprets what the subject was thinking when data was taken from it? The actual decoding occurs in the <strong>complex neural network </strong>that converts data into image format. But the humans have to rain the system first to get-go everything. They train the machine about the human brain thinking strategy that how it works and make a solution. It gets information from blood flow as it tracks blood's path, way, direction, and speed to reach the brain.</p><p>After it, the system starts producing images related to the information it gets by tracking blood flow. The process is only possible if the system comes with multilayers of <strong>deep neural networks. DNN</strong>involves the processing of information in image form. The information is then carried towards <strong>Deep Generator Network (DGN) Algorithm, </strong>which finally creates the image with high precision and accuracy. If we obtain images without using DGN, we can't get a high resolution or clear images of a different thought. DGN captures faces, eyes, and textual patterns and produces high-quality visual clues. With an efficient DGN algorithm, efficiency can be exceeded to 99%, and highly matching decoded images are obtained.</p><h3 id="the-methodology-of-the-experiment-deep-image-reconstruction">The methodology of the Experiment; Deep Image Reconstruction</h3><p>In simple words, the system consists of two necessary steps:</p><p>1. &nbsp;A subject sees an image, and the same image is shown to the AI system; thus, it can recreate its image.<br>2. &nbsp;After it, the subject’s brain thinks about that image, and AI recreates the same image by showing real-time response.</p><p>The scientists selected three subjects and showed them natural geometric shapes, artificial images, and other objects of varying characters. They repeated the same exposure of showing objects in varying periods for almost ten weeks and recorded their brainwaves. In <strong>experiment number one</strong>, they recorded the brain activity of the subject when seeing the particular object out of 25. In contrast, they measured brain activity by hiding the image and asked the brain to think about it (<strong>experiment number 2</strong>). </p><p>In both scenarios, they recorded the image created by artificial intelligence and then compared them to get staggering results. The filtered data is considered as a template of sorts. Then they used a decoder to identify the images via fMRI. They scanned brain activity and used the reverse-engineered method to produce an image of information obtained from thoughts. The scientists enabled <strong>deep learning networks </strong>to understand the brainwaves and decode its information to get output.</p><p>AI is so fast as it has the power of guessing about a particular problem. It asks and answers its questions at a rapid speed. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="ai-visualizing-static-thoughts">AI Visualizing Static Thoughts </h3><p>Results were outstanding as the computer reconstructed that image but with low accuracy. The quality of images in both experiments was fizzy and comparatively low in the second experiment case. The reason was that it's difficult for a brain to remember an image as identical as it is. It enables scientists to decode ''hieratical'' images with various colors, pixels, and formations. The system establishes, for instance, can predict a picture of a bird, a plant, or an animal. Technology goes on proceeding towards refinement for better implementation of a particular process. </p><h3 id="statement-of-kamitani-about-the-project">Statement of Kamitani About the Project</h3><p>Kamitani was excited about their mutual hard work and getting mind-blowing results. He talked to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a>as:</p><blockquote>‘’We have been studying methods to reconstruct or recreate an image a person sees just by looking at its brain activity. Our previous method was to suppose that an image consists of pixels or simple shapes. But our brain processes visual information hierarchically extracting different levels of features or components of different complexities.''</blockquote><blockquote>'These neural networks or AI models can be used as a proxy for the human brain's hierarchical structure,' he added more. </blockquote><h3 id="ai-decoding-videos-you-re-watching-from-your-brain-activity">AI Decoding Videos You’re Watching from Your Brain Activity</h3><p>There is another group of scientists who published their research on ‘<strong>’Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision’’ </strong>in <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>. They developed deep learning algorithms to scan the human brain and its working principles to decode its information.</p><p>Their experiment was based on three women who watched videos of hundreds of unique categories for several hours, and the scientists recorded their brain activity. The videos were on birds, airplanes, and other related objects. They obtained images from a popular Neural Encoding and Decoding with Deep Learning for Dynamic Natural Vision. The scientists used a functional MRI machine that measures signals of activity in the visual cortex. As the women watched several clips, the deep learning algorithms predicted activity closely related to the actual brain activity. Dozens of brain parts respond to a specific thought; thus, the artificial system mimics natural brain working strategies and shows visible results. </p><p>It also helped scientists to recognize which part of the cortex is involved in thought …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

    <p>Dijkstra famously dissed testing by saying “Program testing can be used to show
the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”
As if you should choose one over the other.
I don’t see them as opposites but as complementary techniques that
should both be used to improve the quality of your code.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of formal verification.
Formal verification tools can be the best bug-finding tools you have
ever used.
And they can completely eliminate entire classes of bugs from your code.
But, formal verification won’t find bugs in your
specification; or in your assumptions about your dependencies; or in your
build/CI harness, etc. (See <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers/fonseca:ecs:2017">Fonseca</a> for more examples
of where testing has found bugs in formally verified systems.)</p>

<p>And, we all reluctantly agree that Dijkstra was right: even a thorough,
perfectly executed test plan can miss bugs.</p>

<p>So, for the last few months, I have been trying to have both.
We (my team and I at Google) have been reimplementing Jason Lingle’s
<a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest">proptest</a> property-testing library for use with Rust formal verification tools.
The original proptest lets you write test harnesses to test that your code
(probably) satisfies properties.
Today, we are releasing <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">a reimplementation of the proptest interface</a>
that enables you to use exactly the same test harnesses to
formally verify that the properties hold.
So far, we have only tried this with the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a>
but our implementation is based on the verification
interface used in <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/verification-competitions/">verification competitions</a> so it should be
possible to port our library to many other verification tools.<sup id="fnref:for-Rust" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:for-Rust">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>[Before I go any further, I should mention that what we are <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">releasing this
week</a> is a very early research prototype.  It is not ready for serious use
and it is definitely not an official, supported Google product.  We are
releasing it now, in its current, immature state because we want to have
a conversation about how programmers want to formally verify Rust code
and we think that it is helpful to have something to push against.
We welcome pull requests that add support for other verifiers, or that
push the design in a better direction.]</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proptest-test-harness">A proptest test harness</h2>

<p>To get an idea for what property testing looks like in <code>proptest</code>,
we’ll look at an example from the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">proptest book</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {
    a + b
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_add(a in 0..1000i32, b in 0..1000i32) {
        let sum = add(a, b);
        assert!(sum &gt;= a);
        assert!(sum &gt;= b);
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example defines a property called <code>test_add</code> that tests a function called
<code>add</code>.  In particular, it checks that, for non-negative values <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, the
result of <code>sum(a, b)</code> is at least as large as <code>a</code> and as <code>b</code>.</p>

<p>The notation <code>0..1000i32</code> represents the set of all values in the range <code>[0 ..
1000)</code> and the notation <code>a in 0..1000i32</code> says that a value <code>a</code> should be
chosen from that set.</p>

<p>The <code>proptest!</code> macro converts this property into a test function
that repeatedly generates random values for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and executes the
body of the property.</p>

<p>(After adding in <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/proptest-book/proptest/tutorial/macro-proptest.html">some additional glue code</a>) we can run this example with the command</p>



<p>which produces the following output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and, if we deliberately write a property that doesn’t hold, then <code>cargo test</code>
produces output more like this</p>

<div><div><pre><code>running 1 test
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

---- test_add stdout ----
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9
thread 'test_add' panicked at 'Test failed: assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100; minimal failing input: a = 0, b = 0
        successes: 0
        local rejects: 0
        global rejects: 0
', src/main.rs:7:1


failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="verifying-with-propverify">Verifying with propverify</h2>

<p>Proptest checks the above property by generating random values and testing.
But we can also interpret the property as saying that for all values
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the sets, the body of the property will not panic.
That is, we can interpret it as a universally quantified specification.</p>

<p>To verify the above property, we use a script that compiles the Rust
code, invokes the <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE symbolic execution engine</a> and filters
the output of KLEE to determine whether there is any choice of <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> that can cause the body of the property to panic.</p>



<p>This produces output like this: confirming that the property does hold</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Running 1 test(s)
test test_add ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed
VERIFICATION_RESULT: VERIFIED
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And, if we change the example property so that the property does not hold,
<code>cargo-verify</code> produces this output.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>thread 'test_add' panicked at 'assertion failed: sum &gt;= a + 100', src/main.rs:11:9

running 1 test
  Value a = 0
  Value b = 0
test test_add ... FAILED

failures:

failures:
    test_add

test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On this example, random testing and formal verification produced similar
results.
I could have chosen an example where formal verification found a bug that
random testing misses.
Or I could have chosen an example where random testing easily finds
a bug but formal verification spins forever.
But, in this post, I wanted to focus on the similarity between the two
approaches, not the differences.</p>

<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>

<p>In this article, we used an example that was easy to explain but
does not really show off the power of <code>propverify</code>.
Some slightly better examples are</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/compatibility-test/src/collections.rs#L60">collections.rs</a>
where we check properties involving standard Rust collection
types such as vectors and B-trees.
(This should be read in conjunction with the <a href="https://altsysrq.github.io/rustdoc/proptest/latest/proptest/collection/index.html">proptest
documentation</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/0a6a0ff2b3880eb4a19d8161bfae8d163b0a65ec/compatibility-test/src/dynamic.rs#L82">dynamic.rs</a>
where we check properties involving trait objects by
quantifying over a subset of the possible instances of the trait.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, we have more documentation about</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-propverify.md">Using the propverify library</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-annotations.md">Using the lower level <code>verification-annotations</code> API</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools/blob/main/docs/using-klee.md">The many, many flags we use when compiling Rust code so that it can be verified with KLEE</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two are mostly for the benefit of verification tool developers.</p>

<h2 id="our-next-steps">Our next steps</h2>

<p><em>[You can either read this as a sketch of what we plan to do or
as an admission of what we have not yet done.
As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOILZ_D3aRg">Fred and Ginger said</a>,
“Tomato. Tomato.”]</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tools have a horrifically complicated set of dependencies.</p>

    <p>This is partly because formal verification is not quite popular
enough for enough Debian/Homebrew packages to exist and partly
because we need some very specific versions.
(It may also be possible to remove some dependencies!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are in the process of adding <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/mir-verifier">Crux-MIR</a> support to the library
and tool.
Crux-MIR is a new part of Galois’
<a href="https://galois.com/project/software-analysis-workbench/">Software Analysis Workbench (SAW)</a>
that verifies the MIR code generated by the Rust compiler.</p>

    <p>This is taking us a bit longer than using KLEE
because the functionality of our <code>cargo-verify</code> script
overlaps with the functionality of Crux-MIR but they have slightly different
approaches – we’re still working on the best way to handle the resulting
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be useful to focus our attention on a single crate at a time.
We have some ideas for how to do that with fuzzing and verification
but we have not had a chance to try them yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have not looked seriously at how well this approach scales.</p>

    <p>The collections support in the <code>propverify</code> library has a few
tricks to avoid some obvious scaling issues, but we don’t know if
those tricks work well for all verification tools and they
probably only scratch the surface of what needs to be done.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Testing and formal verification are usually portrayed as mortal enemies.
I think that misses a huge opportunity to use your existing familiarity and
comfort with testing to let you get value out of formal verification tools.</p>

<p>I encourage you to download <a href="https://github.com/project-oak/rust-verification-tools">our library and tool</a>,
try it out and give us feedback.
If you are working on a Rust verification tool, we would love it
if you tried to use our library with your tool.
And we would love it even more if you sent us a pull request.</p>

<p>It’s probably not a good idea to commit to using the library at this stage:
it is not very robust at the moment and I expect that it will change a lot
as we gain experience from porting the library to other types of
formal verification tools.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<section>
			<p>When we are storing data, we typically assume that our storage system of choice returns that data later just as we put it in.
However what guarantees do we have that this is actually the case?
The case made here is the case of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-bit-rot-and-how-can-i-detect-it-rhel">bitrot</a>, the silent degradation of the physical charges that physically make up today’s storage devices.</p>
<p>To counter this type of problem, one can employ data checksumming, as it is done by both btrfs and ZFS.
However, while in the long run btrfs might be the tool of choice for this, it is fairly complex and not yet too mature, whereas ZFS, the most prominent candidate for this type of features, is <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/issues/8314">not</a> <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2016/feb/25/zfs-and-linux/">without</a> <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/zfs-licensing-and-linux">hassle</a> and it must be recompiled for every kernel update (although <a href="https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Custom-Packages">automation exists</a>).</p>
<p>In this blogpost, we’ll therefore take a look into a storage design that actually checks whether the returned data is actually valid and not silently corrupted inside our storage system and is completely designed with components available in Linux itself without the need to recompile and test your storage layer on every kernel upgrade.
We find that this storage design, while fulfilling the same purpose as ZFS, does not only yield comparable performance, but actually in some cases even able to significantly outperform it, as the benchmarks at the end indicate.</p>

<p>The system we will test in the following will be constructed from four components (including the filesystem):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dm-integrity</strong> provides blocklevel checksumming for all incoming data and will check said checksum for all data read through it (and return a read error if it doesn’t match).</li>
<li><strong>mdraid</strong> provides redundancy if a disk misbehaves, avoiding data loss. If the dm-integrity-layer detects invalid data from the disk, mdraid will see a read-error and can immediately correct this error by reading it from somewhere else in the redundancy pool.</li>
<li><strong>dm-crypt</strong> on top of the RAID, right below the filesystem will encrypt the data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>ext4</strong> as a filesystem to actually store files on it</li>
</ul>
<p>The order matters, dm-integrity must be placed between the harddisks and the mdraid, to ensure that data corruption errors can be corrected by mdraid after they have been detected by dm-integrity. Similarly, dm-crypt has nothing to do with redundancy, therefore it should be placed on top of of mdraid, to only having to be passed once, and not multiple times as it would be the case for placing it alongside dm-integrity.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This yields the following storage design:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Storage system architecture</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture of the storeage system. Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems.

Grey depicts physical hardware, green depicts device mapper technologies, yellow indicates mdraid and blue indicates filesystems. The encryption layer will later be ommitted when comparing performance to ZFS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/mkstorage.sh.txt">This script will assemble the above depicted system and mount it to /mnt.</a></p>

<p>Now that we have an assembled system, we’d like to quantify the performance impact of the different layers.
The test setup for this is a <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Kobol Helios4</a> (primarily because it’s the intended target platform for this storage system) with four disks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> running Debian 10 “Buster”.
The Helios4 is powered by an energy efficient dual-core ARM SoC optimized for storage systems.
The setup was not built based on the entire disks, but on partitions of a size of 10GiB each, allowing multiple parallel designs and therefore easing the benchmarking procedure, as well as speeding up the experiments<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="layer-analysis-of-performance-impact">Layer analysis of performance impact</h2>
<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>
<p>To benchmark throughput, the following commands were used:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=8000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>This procedure was repeated ten times for proper statistics for the different cases for both read (<code>r</code>) and write (<code>w</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4 filesystem only (<code>f</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>encryption, topped by ext4 (<code>cf</code>, one disk only)</li>
<li>mdraid (RAID6/double parity), topped by the former (<code>rcf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
<li>the final setup, including integrity (<code>ircf</code>, 4 disks)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layers.svg" alt="Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system for both read (top row) and write (bottom row). Each dot indicates one measurement. f: filesystem, cf: crypto+f, rcf:raid+cf, ircf: integrity+rcf. <a href="https://kobol.io/helios4/">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see different interesting results in the data:
First of all, the encryption engine on the helios4 is not completely impact free, although the resulting performance is still more than sufficient for the designated uses for a Helios4.</p>
<p>Secondly, we see that adding integrity layer does have a noticable impact on writing, but a negligible impact on reading, indicating that especially for systems primarily intended to read data from adding the integrity layer is a matter of negligible cost.</p>
<p>For write-heavy systems, the performance impact is more considerable, but for certain workloads, such as the home-NAS-case the Helios is designed for, the performance can still be considered fully sufficient, especially as normally the system would cache those writes to a certain extend, which was explicitly disabled for benchmarking purposes (see <code>conv=fdatasync</code> in the benchmark procedure).</p>
<p>The reason for the degradation in write (but not in read) is likely due to the fact that the integrity layer and the mdraid layer are decoupled from one another, the raid-layer is not aware that for a double parity setup it effectively has to write the same information three times, and the integrity layer has to account for all three writes before the data is considered synced as required by <code>conv=fdatasync</code>.</p>
<h3 id="latency">Latency</h3>
<p>We have found that the throguhput of such a storage design is yielding useful throughput-rates.
The next question is about the latency of the system, which we will, for simplicity, only estimate for random 4K-reads.
Again, just as above, we will investigate the impact of the different layers of the system.
To do so, we read 100.000 sectors randomly from an 18GB sized testfile filling the storage mountpoint for each configuration after dropping all caches.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Latency comparison of system layers</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/layerlatencies.svg" alt="Distribution of latencies in milliseconds for different arrangements of layers on Kobol Helios4 system. green denotes the median, black denotes the average of the latencies of the respective setup, access times below 1ms were considered cache hits and therefore excluded for the computation of mean and average.

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure above yields several interesting insights:
First of all, we do see cache hits close to zero milliseconds, furthermore, we see that the latency distribution is fairly evenly distributed over the available range and finally and most interestingly, we see that the impact of the several layers onto the latency is measurable, but rather irrellevant for typical practical purposes.</p>
<h2 id="performance-comparison-with-zfs">Performance comparison with ZFS</h2>
<p>So far we have tested the setup on its intended target platform, the Helios4.
To compare the resulting system against the elephant in the room, ZFS, we will use a different test platform, based on an Intel i7-2600K as CPU and 4x1TB disks, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> was not reliably buildable on Debian Buster on ARM, and when it actually built, it explicitly stated that 32bit-processors (as the Helios’ CPU) are not supported by upstream, although technically the system would run.</p>
<p>To allow for a cleaner comparison, the testbed was accordinly changed to accomodate for ZFS’s preferences.
As ZFS did not adhere to <code>conv=fdatasync</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the main memory was restricted to 1GB, swap was turned off and the size of the testfile was chosen to be 18GB.
This way, any caching happening would be at least significantly reduced as there was little space next to the OS inside of the main memory for caching.</p>
<p>All tests were run on a Debian 10 “Buster” with Linux 4.19, ZFS was used in form of the package <code>zfs-dkms</code> in version 0.8.2 from backports.
The storage layer for both setups was layouted with double parity (RAID6/raidz2) and, as the <code>zfs-dkms</code> package in Debian was not able to do encryption, the mdraid-based setup was also setup without the encryption layer.</p>
<h3 id="throughput-1">Throughput</h3>
<p>The commands used for benchmarking throughput were conceptually the same as above:</p>
<pre><code># write:
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/testfile bs=1M count=18000 conv=fdatasync

# read
echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_cache  # drop all caches
dd if=/path/to/testfile of=/dev/zero conv=fdatasync
</code></pre>
<p>Although ZFS seemingly does not adhere to any cache dropping or syncing instructions, they were still performed and adhered to by the mdraid-based setup.</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput comparison, zfs &amp; md</h4>
    <img src="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-md-throughput.svg" alt="Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. Testplatform"> <figcaption><p>Throughput for both ZFS and the md-based setup for both read and write. Each dot indicates one measurement, the green line indicates the median of all measurements. <a href="https://insanity.industries/post/preserving-data-integrity/zfs-testbed.txt">Testplatform</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The results are very interesting: While the md-based setup performs less consistent in and of itself, it still consistently outperforms ZFS in read performance.
When it comes to write, though, ZFS performs noticably better.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>To investigate the cause of this unexpected balance, we note that while ZFS combines raid, integrity and filesystem in one component, for the md-based setup these are separate components.
Of these components, not only the filesystem, but also the <code>dm-integrity</code> implements journalling to avoid inconsistencies in case of a power outage.
This leads to increased work until the transaction has been fully flushed to disk, which can be seen in the next figure, where the md-based system (without the encryption layer) is tested with both journalling enabled and disabled in the integrity layer:</p>
<figure>
    <h4>Throughput effect of integrity journaling</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599156332456/7WwIJcqD0.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>We all use some VS Code extensions for our day to day development and are always on a hunt for more useful extensions. Here is a list of mine and how I use them:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.peacockcode.dev/">Peacock</a> </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1593585542633/58FKxSF2u.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt=""></p>
<p>We have all been there when we have two editors open and coded in the wrong one 🤦  Peacock helps me differentiate between different workspaces by setting a different color theme to VS Code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2">Bracket Pair Colorizer</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/activeScopeBorder.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easily distinguishable bracket scopes are always good for programming and this extension does it well.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-bookmarks/raw/master/images/printscreen-select-lines.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you are in the flow but navigating the code from one function to another becomes tedious, this lets you bookmark code at different lines and you can easily access it using shortcuts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There have been times when I have embarrassingly spent more time than needed debugging an error only to find out it was a spelling mistake. This extension keeps that in check.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auiworks.amvim">AmVim</a></p>
<p> I am a huge fan of Vim, it legit increases your productivity without having to touch the trackpad. AmVim is one of the Vim mode extension for VSCode, I found this to be quite good and not bloaty compared to other Vim extensions.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync">Settings Sync</a></p>
<p>Settings Sync helps you keep the same environment of VSCode (extensions and preferences) across machines.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log">Turbo Console log</a></p>
<p><img src="https://image.ibb.co/dysw7p/insert_log_message.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This one is really useful while debugging, it helps create meaningful logs using shortcuts. All you have to do is highlight the variable and press the keybindings.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode">Tab Nine</a></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode/raw/master/assets/tabnine.gif" alt="sdfsdf"></p>
<p>I just recently came across this one in one of <a href="https://hashnode.com/@dailydevtips">Chris Bongers</a>'s article. Really like it! It is sometimes just scary how accurately it predicts auto-completion (It uses deep-learning model locally on your machine to come up with the predictions).</p>
<hr><p>
Other than these I use the common ones like <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon theme</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight">Color Highlight</a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wart.ariake-dark">Ariake Dark</a> is my VS Code theme.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful and feel free to share the extensions you use in the comments below. You can also @ me on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/vamsirao7">twitter</a></p>

<p>How much does running a webapp in production actually cost? Maybe more than you think. Keepthescore.co is a Python flask application running on DigitalOcean and Firebase. It currently has around 55k unique visitors per month, per day it’s around 3.4k.</p>

<p><img src="https://keepthescore.co/blog/money-tree.jpg" alt="A money tree">
<em>Image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@micheile">Micheile Henderson</a></em></p>

<p>Here’s a monthly breakdown with some background information on each cost:</p>

<h3 id="servers-and-database-on-digitalocean">Servers and database on DigitalOcean</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $95</strong></p>

<p>The webapp runs on two identical DigitalOcean servers (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 80GB disk). We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green_deployment">blue-green deployment</a>, which is a great way of running and hosting a webapp (more on that in a future post) but it does mean that you need 2 identical production servers.</p>

<p>The database is a hosted Postgres instance also on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Note: the servers are oversized for the load we’re currently seeing. The reason for that is that we tried to solve a production issue by increasing the server specs. It didn’t solve the problem, and now we can’t down-size the servers without re-provisioning them 🤷‍♀️.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="code-repo-on-github">Code repo on GitHub</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $0</strong></p>

<p>This is free. Thanks GitHub!
</p><hr>

<h3 id="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $60</strong></p>

<p>We use a reporting tool called <a href="https://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a> to generate insights and reports from the database. The tool itself is opensource and free, but hosting it is fairly expensive. Currently it runs on an EC2 instance. There are definitely some savings that could be realised here.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="google-cloud">Google Cloud</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $1.32</strong></p>

<p>We use Firebase for the <a href="https://keepthescore.co/basketball-scoreboard/">realtime basketball scoreboard</a>. We also use the Google Sheets API for some custom scoreboards. Overall it must be said that the Google Cloud APIs are great value for money (so far).</p>

<p>We have plans to move away from DigitalOcean and onto Google Cloud infrastructure in the next year.
</p><hr>

<h3 id="dns-hosting">DNS hosting</h3>

<p><strong>Costs per month: $5</strong></p>

<p>Our domain is registered with <a href="https://dnsimple.com/">DNSimple.com</a>.
</p><hr>



<p><strong>Costs per month: $10</strong></p>

<p>Scoreboards and this blog have the option of allowing a discussion on the same page – this uses the <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> service. Disqus has a free tier but they began showing ads so we were forced to move to the paid tier.</p>

<p>We are planning to move to <a href="https://commento.io/">Commento</a> in the future, which is cheaper, has no ads, and respects your privacy.
</p><hr>

<h2 id="is-it-worth-it-is-there-revenue">Is it worth it? Is there revenue?</h2>

<p>In total that’s around <strong>$171 USD per month</strong>. If you’re running a company with employees that would be peanuts, but in this case the cost is being borne by a single indie-developer out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is that on the revenue side there’s a big fat zero. This is the reason why we are currently working on monetization. This will include banner ads and payments via Stripe. Expect to see these features land by next week! Anyway, more about that in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-spending-way-too-much-money">You are spending way too much money!</h2>

<p>This post generated an interesting discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24372084">Hacker News</a>. One recurring theme
was that our stack is large and expensive and that we could massively reduce costs.</p>

<p>This is true. But here are some things that are also true:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Reducing costs” is not our primary objective at the moment: time is more valuable than money right now.</li>
<li>We are not devops experts and optimizing operations takes time.</li>
<li>Our primary objective right now is velocity of product development.</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be a follow up post once we do optimize our stack.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening and so long, 👋</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2046" target="\_blank">Issue 2046 was recently disclosed on the Project Zero bugtracker by Sergey Glazunov</a>. This issue describes a bug that was introduced into V8 when the developers decided to reimplement two CodeStubAssembler (CSA) functions using the new Torque language. These two functions are used to create new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects in JavaScript, and although the new implementations looked valid at first glance, they were missing a key component: a maximum length check to ensure that the newly created array’s length cannot not go past a predefined upper limit.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, this bug does not look exploitable (and surely, had I come across it myself, I would have assumed it to be unexploitable initially), but as shown on the bug report, Sergey made use of TurboFan’s typer to gain access to a very powerful exploitation primitive: an array whose length field is much larger than its capacity. This primitive provides an attacker with an out-of-bounds access primitive on the V8 heap, which can very easily lead to code execution.</p>

<p>Lets perform a root cause analysis of the complex reproduction case provided in the bugtracker, and see exactly how such a powerful primitive was achieved from such a simple bug.</p>



<p>If you want to follow along, you will need to build V8 version 8.5.51 (commit <code>64cadfcf4a56c0b3b9d3b5cc00905483850d6559</code>). <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/build" target="\_blank">Follow this guide for build instructions</a>. I would recommend building with full symbols (modify <code>args.gn</code> and add the line <code>symbol_level = 2</code>).</p>

<p>From the <code>x64.release</code> directory, you can use the following command to compile the release version with zero compiler optimizations (line-by-line debugging of optimized binaries can be pretty annoying at times):</p>

<p><code>find . -type f -exec grep '\-O3' -l {} ";" -exec sed -i 's/\-O3/\-O0/' {} ";" -ls
</code></p>

<p>I would still recommend to build the normal release version (with compiler optimizations enabled) as well if you want to follow along with some of the code examples in this blog post. Without the optimizations, some of the examples will take an excruciatingly long time to run.</p>

<p>Grab the proof of concepts from the bugtracker linked above.</p>



<p>In order to understand why the bug was introduced in the first place, we first have to understand a little bit about the way the CodeStubAssembler works, and why Torque was created as a replacement for it.</p>

<h2 id="v8-before-2017">V8 before 2017</h2>

<p>Before 2017, many of the JavaScript builtin functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.concat</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map" target="\_blank">Array.prototype.map</a>, etc) were written in JavaScript themselves, and although these functions made use of TurboFan (V8’s speculative optimizing compiler, explained in more detail later) to squeeze out as much performance as possible, they simply did not run as fast as they would have if they were written in native code.</p>

<p>For the most common builtin functions, the developers would write very optimized versions in hand-written assembly. This was doable because of how detailed the descriptions of these builtin functions are on the ECMAScript specifications (<a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-properties-of-the-array-prototype-object" target="\_blank">Example</a>). However, there was a big downside: V8 targets a large number of platforms and architectures, which meant that the V8 developers had to write and rewrite all of these optimized builtin functions for every single architecture. As the ECMAScript standard is constantly evolving, and new language features are constantly being standardized, maintaining all of this hand-written assembly became extremely tedious and error-prone.</p>

<p>Having ran into this issue, the developers started looking for a better solution. It wasn’t until TurboFan was introduced into V8 had they found a solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-codestubassembler">The CodeStubAssembler</h2>

<p>TurboFan brought with it a cross-platform intermediate representation (IR) for low-level instructions. The V8 team decided to build a new frontend on top of TurboFan that they dubbed the <strong>CodeStubAssembler</strong>. The CodeStubAssembler defined a portable assembly language that the developers could use to implement the optimized builtin functions. Best of all, the cross-platform nature of the portable assembly language meant that the developers only had to write each builtin function <strong>exactly once</strong>. The actual native code for all the supported platforms and architecture was left for TurboFan to compile. <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/csa" target="\_blank">You can read more about the CSA here</a>.</p>

<p>Although this was a great improvement, there was still a slight problem. Writing optimal code with the CodeStubAssembler’s language required the developers to carry a lot of specialized knowledge in their heads. Even with all of this knowledge, there were a lot of non-trivial gotchas that often led to security vulnerabilities. This lead the V8 team to finally write a new component that they dubbed <strong>Torque</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="torque">Torque</h2>

<p>Torque is a language frontend that’s built on top of the CodeStubAssembler. It has a TypeScript-like syntax, a strong type system, and great error-checking capabilities, all of which makes it a great alternative for the V8 developers to write builtin functions in. The Torque compiler converts the Torque code into efficient assembly code using the CodeStubAssembler. It greatly reduced the number of security bugs, as well as the steep learning curve that new V8 developers previously faced when learning how to write efficient builtin functions in the CSA assembly language. <a href="https://v8.dev/docs/torque">You can read more about Torque here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reason-for-the-bug">The reason for the bug</h2>

<p>Because Torque is still relatively new, there is still a fair amount of CSA code that needs to be reimplemented in it. This included the CSA code that handled the creation of new <code>FixedArray</code> and <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects, which are “fast” arrays in V8 (“fast” arrays have contiguous array backing stores, whereas “slow” arrays have dictionary based backing stores).</p>

<p>The actual bug in Issue 2046 stems from the developers’ decision to reimplement this array creation builtin function in Torque. As bad luck would have it, the reimplementation missed a key security check that lead to an exploitable condition.</p>



<p>The developers reimplemented the <a href="https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/v8/src/codegen/code-stub-assembler.cc?rcl=5db4a28ef75f893e85b7f505f5528cc39e9deef5&amp;l=3805" target="\_blank">CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</a> function into two Torque macros, one for <code>FixedArray</code> objects, and another for <code>FixedDoubleArray</code> objects:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedArray</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>macro</span> <span>NewFixedDoubleArray</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span> <span>type</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>intptr</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span> <span>Iterator</span><span>):</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>|</span><span>EmptyFixedArray</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>length</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>kEmptyFixedArray</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>FixedDoubleArray</span><span>{</span>
    <span>map</span><span>:</span> <span>kFixedDoubleArrayMap</span><span>,</span>
    <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>Convert</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Smi</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>length</span><span>),</span>
    <span>floats</span><span>:</span> <span>...</span><span>it</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you compare the above functions to the <code>CodeStubAssembler::AllocateFixedArray</code> variant, you’ll notice a maximum length check missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NewFixedArray</code> should ensure that the new <code>FixedArray</code> being returned has a length below <code>FixedArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x7fffffd</code>, or <code>134217725</code>.</li>
  <li>In the same way, <code>NewFixedDoubleArray</code> should sanity check the array’s length against <code>FixedDoubleArray::kMaxLength</code>, which is <code>0x3fffffe</code>, or <code>67108862</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we look at what we can do with this missing length check, lets try to understand how Sergey triggers this bug, as it isn’t as simple as just creating a new array with a size larger than <code>kMaxLength</code>.</p>



<p>In order to understand the proof of concepts, we need to understand a little bit more about how arrays are represented in V8. Feel free to skip to the next section if you already know how this works.</p>

<h2 id="arrays-in-memory">Arrays in memory</h2>

<p>Let’s take the array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> as an example and view it in memory. You can do this by running V8 with the <code>--allow-natives-syntax</code> flag, creating the array, and doing a <code>%DebugPrint(array)</code> to get its address. Use GDB to view the address in memory. I’ll show a diagram instead.</p>

<p>When you allocate an array in V8, it actually allocates two objects. Note that every field is 4 bytes / 32 bits in length:</p>

<p><img alt="Libvirt The Unsung Hero of Cloud Computing Platforms" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_the_unsung_hero.png"></p><p>Initially my intention was to write an article on <strong>Round up of open source Cloud Management Platforms (CMP)</strong>, but while doing research found one piece of software library so fundamental, that it holds the key to very existence of Cloud Computing services and platforms as we know it today (that includes Amazon AWS, OpenStack and CloudStack). So I decided to postpone my idea and started to write an article on this <strong>Unsung hero of Cloud Computing</strong> called libvirt <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>, which I believe many people won’t have heard of. Obviously talking about software library tend to be technical, so this article will have a technical tone, but I will attempt to make it readable for everyone interested in Cloud Computing.</p>
<p>Libvirt is an open source API, daemon and management tool for managing platform virtualzation and these APIs are widely used in the orchestration layer of Cloud Management Platform. Libvirt makes it possible to control and manage millions of compute nodes, storage and network devices via common programmable interface. Its like being able to control and orchestrate fleet of millions of car irrespective of different manufacturer, model, or engine through a common interface from a single car (it can be more then one car for redundancy and high availability). What started as a management API for Xen, today has been extended to support major components of Cloud Computing platforms.</p>
<div id="libvirt-goals-architecture">
<h2>Libvirt Goals &amp; Architecture</h2>
<p>Libvirt defines following terms for its goals <a href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Mapping of libvirt terms to virtualized or containerized physical machine" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_terms_mapping.png"></p><ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong> is a single physical machine.</li>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong> is a layer of softeare allowing to virtualize a node in a set of physical machines with possible different configurations that the node itself.</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> is an instance of an operating system (or subsystem in case of container virtualization like OpenVZ and lxc) running on a virtualized machine provided by the hypervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on above terms <strong>“The goal of libvirt is to provide a common and stable layer sufficient to securely manage domains on a node, possibly remote”</strong>. So libvirt should provide all APIs needed to do the management, such as: provision, create, modify, monitor, control, migrate and stop the domains - within the limits of the support of the hypervisor for those operations. This implies following sub-goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All API can be carried remotely though secure APIs</li>
<li>While most API will be generic in term of hypervisor or Host OS, some API may be targeted to a single virtualization environment as long as the semantic for the operations from a domain management perspective is clear</li>
<li>the API should allow to do efficiently and cleanly all the operations needed to manage domains on a node, including resource provisioning and setup</li>
<li>the API will not try to provide high level virtualization policies or multi-nodes management features like load balancing, but the API should be sufficient so they can be implemented on top of libvirt</li>
<li>stability of the API is a big concern, libvirt should isolate applications from the frequent changes expected at the lower level of the virtualization framework</li>
<li>the node being managed may be on a different physical machine than the management program using libvirt, to this effect libvirt supports remote access, but should only do so by using secure protocols.</li>
<li>libvirt will provide APIs to enumerate, monitor and use the resources available on the managed node, including CPUs, memory, storage, networking, and NUMA partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So libvirt is intended to be a building block for higher level management tools and for applications focusing on virtualization of a single node (the only exception being domain migration between node capabilities which involves more than one node).</p>
<div id="libvirt-driver-based-architecture">
<h3>Libvirt Driver Based Architecture</h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt driver based architecture" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_architecture.png"></p><p>Libvirt to support wide variety of hypervisor implements a driver-based architecture. Based on car analogy, it means delegating the actual implementation of control of different cars to the drivers specifically designed for make, model and engine of the specific car. Libvirt currently supports:</p>
<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LXC - Linux Containers</li>
<li>OpenVZ</li>
<li>QEMU</li>
<li>Test - Used for testing</li>
<li>UML - User Mode Linux</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware ESX</li>
<li>VMware Workstation/Player</li>
<li>Xen</li>
<li>Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
<li>IBM PowerVM (phyp)</li>
<li>Parallels</li>
<li>Remote - Accessing libvirt on remote node through libvirtd (libvirt daemon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Directory backend</li>
<li>Local filesystem backend</li>
<li>Network filesystem backend</li>
<li>Logical Volume Manager (LVM) backend</li>
<li>Disk backend</li>
<li>iSCSI backend</li>
<li>SCSI backend</li>
<li>Multipath backend</li>

<div id="libvirt-api-structure">
<h3>Libvirt API structure <a href="#f3" id="id3">[3]</a></h3>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_api_structure.png"></p><p>The figure above shows the five main objects exported by the API:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>virConnectPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents the connection to a hypervisor. Use one of the virConnectOpen functions to obtain connection to the hypervisor which is then used as a parameter to other connection API’s.</dd>
<dt><strong>virDomainPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one domain either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently running on that node). The function virConnectListAllDomains lists all the domains for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virNetworkPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one network either active or defined (i.e. existing as permanent config file and storage but not currently activated). The function virConnectListAllNetworks lists all the virtualization networks for the hypervisor.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStorageVolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents one storage volume generally used as a block device available to one of the domains. The function virStorageVolLookupByPath finds the storage volume object based on its path on the node.</dd>
<dt><strong>virStoragePoolPtr</strong></dt>
<dd>Represents a storage pool, which is a logical area used to allocate and store storage volumes. The function virConnectListAllStoragePools lists all of the virtualization storage pools on the hypervisor. The function virStoragePoolLookupByVolume finds the storage pool containing a given storage volume.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These names follow C conventions, but developers of cloud computing platforms and applications do not need to use C directly, there are language bindings available for major languages. Currently libvirt API language bindings <a href="#f4" id="id4">[4]</a> are available for C#, Java, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.</p>
</div>
<div id="domain-management-architecture">
<h3>Domain Management Architecture</h3>
<p>There are two distinct means for domain management using libvirt API.</p>
<p><strong>1. Single node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_single_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As illustrated in the figure above in this mode applications (cloud management platform i.e. CMP applications) and domains exist on the same node. In this scenario applications directly works through the libvirt api on the host operating system (os) to control and manage the local domains.</p>
<p><strong>2. Multi node domain management</strong></p>
<p><img alt="libvirt API structure" src="https://vyomtech.com/_images/libvirt_multi_node_domain_management.png"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, applications (CMP applications) using libvirt API and the domains to manage or control are on separate nodes. In this mode a special domain called <strong>libvirtd</strong> (libvirt daemon) needs to run on remote nodes. The management application nodes use the nodes underlying network communicattion to communicate with remote <em>libvirtd</em> through the local libvirt using custom protocol. Actually libvirt uses Remote <a href="#f6" id="id5">[6]</a> driver for communicating with remote node and remote API calls are handled synchronously. Remote driver for libvirt supports a range of transports like:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>tls</em></dt>
<dd>TLS 1.0 (SSL 3.1) authenticated and encrypted TCP/IP socket, usually listening on a public port number. To use this you will need to generate client and server certificates. The standard port is 16514. This is the <strong>default</strong> transport, if no other is specified.</dd>
<dt><em>unix</em></dt>
<dd>nix domain socket. Since this is only accessible on the local machine, it is not encrypted, and uses Unix permissions or SELinux for authentication. The standard socket names are /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock and /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro (the latter for read-only connections).</dd>
<dt><em>ssh</em></dt>
<dd>Transported over an ordinary ssh (secure shell) connection. Requires Netcat (nc) installed and libvirtd should be running on the remote machine. You should use some sort of ssh key management (eg. ssh-agent) otherwise programs which use this transport will stop to ask for a password.</dd>
<dt><em>ext</em></dt>
<dd>Any external program which can make a connection to the remote machine by means outside the scope of libvirt.</dd>
<dt><em>tcp</em></dt>
<dd>nencrypted TCP/IP socket. Not recommended for production use, this is normally disabled, but an administrator can enable it for testing or use over a trusted network. The standard port is 16509.</dd>
<dt><em>libssh2</em></dt>
<dd>Transport over the SSH protocol using libssh2 instead of the OpenSSH binary. This transport uses the libvirt authentication callback for all ssh authentication calls and therefore supports keyboard-interactive authentication even with graphical management applications. As with the classic ssh transport netcat is required on the remote side.</dd>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Libvirt is one very important library on whose giant shoulders cloud computing services and platforms like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, CloudStack, Eucalyptus and numberous others are standing. Also this API enables developers and companies to build new and innovative cloud computing services or platforms and build awesome applications or services on top of it. Libvirt started in 2005 and with growing popularity of cloud computing, this project will continue to grow. But in most of the conferences, talks and papers related to Cloud Computing I did not find much coverage of libvirt, so while researching Cloud Management platform thought of writing and article on it. Kudos to all the libvirt code contributors for building a beautiful abstraction layer and making life easier for cloud computing services and platform developers. In spite of not getting as much press and coverage as …</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>

The opinions expressed in it are those of its author.)</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="695" data-original-width="695" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wrim0IZG378/X0qLCMaZclI/AAAAAAAAG5s/4Neb2b2IfPU1Ln0JINzTib97Wb-9qLzRQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Grandville_tortoise.jpg" width="400"></a></p>

<p>
One of the paradoxes of the pre-Socratic philosopher Zeno, involves a race between a hare and a tortoise. Here is a different version of that paradox:  I challenge world-record-holder Usain Bolt to a 100 metre race. My only condition is that he gives me a 10 metre start. He accepts. I’ll now explain why he cannot possibly beat me.</p>

<p>
The race begins. To overtake me, Bolt must first reach my starting point at the 10 metre mark. This will take him some time, let’s say roughly one second. In that second I will have moved forward from the 10 metre mark, let’s say 5 metres.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
So now, after one second of the race has passed, Bolt is at the 10 metre point and must reach my new position at the 15 metre point. This will take him about a half of one second, but in that time I will have moved forward again a short distance.</p>

<p>
There is no end to this process; however quickly Bolt catches up to where I was, I will have used that time, however short, to move ahead, albeit by a shorter distance each time. However small the time and distances get, Bolt can never catch me, I will always be ahead.</p>

<p>
So the paradox is that it is impossible for Bolt to overtake me in a 100 metre race. Because we know that this isn’t true, the paradox is telling us something is wrong in the process that got us to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
What goes wrong with the hare and the tortoise paradox is that the endless series of points that, in my example, Bolt would have to pass through, are not actual points. They are abstractions. The points aren’t there, marked in the ground, they are part of a theory. Bolt does not have to run past an infinite number of actual things, just an infinite number of ideas, an infinite number of abstractions.</p>

<p>
It doesn’t seem so impossible now, does it, to run past an abstract idea of endless points. And better still, as each abstract point is a dimensionless point with no length, even if they did exist, how long does it take to run past something that has no length? However many points of zero length you have, zeros don’t add up to anything.</p>

<p>
Another paradox of Zeno states arrows cannot fly. The argument here is that at any particular moment of the flight, the arrow is not moving; at any instant of time, the arrow will be stationary at that particular point. Imagine taking a video of the flight of the arrow and then looking at every frame of the video: in each and every frame the arrow is not moving.</p>

<p>
Again, we know arrows do fly through the air, so this paradox must be telling us there is something wrong with the thought process, not with the flying arrow.</p>

<p>
Zeno has made the same mistake here with time as he made with distance with the hare and the tortoise; he has assumed that the actual is made up of the abstract, that time is made up of frozen instants. In the same way as an infinitesimal point on a line has no length and so the line cannot be made up of points, a frozen instant in time has no duration and so a period of time (the flight of the arrow) cannot be made up of duration-less instants.</p>

<p>
(Zeno’s paradoxes have also been solved by mathematics using sums of infinite series tending to a limit. Infinite series as described by Zeno can in fact be calculated within a finite limit, so there is a point that can be calculated when Bolt will overtake me. Assuming time and space are discrete—that they have a shortest non-zero length—is also a way of solving the paradoxes. There are no instants of time; there is a smallest duration of time and the arrow will be moving within that.)</p>


<p><span>The materialists are making the same type of error as with the Zeno paradoxes of time and distance; they are assuming that an experience we know does happen, is made up of abstractions we can use to describe that experience.</span></p>


<p>
Let us now turn our attention away from distance and time, away from hares and arrows, and look at consciousness. I will attempt to formulate a new Zeno-type paradox for consciousness and see what light that sheds on the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
Before formulating this new paradox, we need to briefly explore what the hard problem of consciousness is, and to do that we need to look at the metaphysical philosophy of materialism. Simply stated, this asserts that everything is made of matter, of physical stuff. You may wonder why such a seemingly obvious and self-explanatory statement requires the title of a metaphysical philosophy. The reason is that materialism isn’t just saying that there are physical things, it is saying everything is physical. Materialism is saying that the thoughts you are having now are physical; it is saying that the curious and unique mix of emotions you are subjectively experiencing at this very moment are purely and solely physical material things. And it is saying that the awareness that witnesses all these subjective feelings is physical. This no longer seems so obvious, does it?</p>

<p>
Not only does it perhaps seem a little strange to assume that all our mental, emotional and spiritual experiences, and the subjective experiencer, are actually objective, external and physical, <i>materialists have absolutely no idea, even in principle, how matter could possibly create our rich inner life of conscious awareness and experience. </i>This is what is referred to as the hard problem of consciousness.</p>

<p>
This is why materialism is a metaphysical philosophy. It is a theory with an assumption that attempts to account for all things. It has not done well at all when it comes to accounting for your continuous and immediate experience of everything. There are other theories that, arguably, do a better job of this. We will look at one later.</p>

<p>
But what of science? Isn’t the indisputable and phenomenal success of science and technology proof that materialism is an extremely successful theory? No. Science is agnostic on metaphysical philosophy. The scientific method and all the advances and technological breakthroughs that follow, work perfectly well regardless of your philosophical beliefs. That is, in fact, its strength: it relies on empirical data, not belief.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
The connection between the scientific method and the philosophy of materialism is no more than the fact that most scientists tend to also be materialists. That’s it. There are scientists who are not materialists; their science is no less valid. The success of science comes from following the scientific method, not from the philosophical beliefs of the scientist.</p>

<p>
Materialism then, posits that consciousness—if it is anything at all—must be physical; it must be so because everything is. All your subjective experiences are simply properties of material arrangements, just like the other physical properties of mass, charge, spin etc.</p>

<p>
Any subjective conscious experience, according to the materialist, must, therefore, be describable in purely measurable and physical terms.  Just as we can describe the mass and charge of particles in numbers and their interactions with equations, the materialist must account for all conscious experiences in the same way; a materialist must treat consciousness the same as matter because, for them, it <i>is</i> matter; because everything is matter.</p>


<p><span>To be a materialist, you have a difficult choice to make: choose the fundamentalist path of denying undeniable reality; or take on the burden of Sisyphus, endlessly rolling the rock of matter towards consciousness, doomed for it to forever roll back to the beginning of your false assumption.</span></p>


<p>
Scientists find many correlations between conscious experience and brain states, and brain states can be described mathematically. This seems promising for the materialist project. Because neuroscientists are mostly philosophical materialists, they tend to assume that this correlation is evidence of causation; that is, that each and every conscious experience is reducible to a specific brain state. This would mean they could describe consciousness with numbers and equations, as your conscious experiences would be nothing more than physical properties of precise neural arrangements in your brain.</p>

<p>
But remember the hard problem. No scientist, and no materialist, has a clue how that could be possible. There is simply no testable hypothesis as to how subjective conscious experiences arise as properties of neurons in your brain. <i>The correlations are science, but the idea that brains cause consciousness, that remains firmly metaphysical.</i></p>

<p>
The metaphysical theory that everything is matter is a philosophy, not a scientific fact. But we can go further and say that even the assumption that there is any matter at all, is equally a theory and a philosophical assumption, not a scientific fact. The idea that there is physical matter outside of our conscious experience is just that, an idea. We only know for sure that we have subjective experience; we cannot know for sure what constitutes that experience. The only thing we know for sure is our immediate experience of being subjectively aware. Everything we can ever possibly know can only be known by us within and via the medium of our subjective experience.</p>

<p>
The scientific method successfully explores the behaviour of the contents of our subjective experience and gives us technology as a result, but the scientific method hasn’t discovered the essence or the true nature of the contents of our conscious experience. It can describe and predict and mimic what happens; it doesn’t tell us what it is.</p>

<p>
The most successful theory of physics, by far, is quantum field theory. It states that what we think of as matter is best understood and predicted by an equation of probabilities. Some recent experiments in quantum mechanics lead Bernardo Kastrup and others to the conclusion that the idea of there being an objective and …</p></div></div>

  <p>01 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>One of the eternal laws of the internet dictates that as soon as one person says
they have a new thing that lets them type faster — a keyboard, a keyboard
layout, an editor configuration, etc. —&nbsp;somebody else must say: “but typing is
not the bottleneck!”</p>

<p>What the second person means is that the first person is wasting their time.
They’re optimizing something that’s not slowing them down. Typing is not the
bottleneck, because <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9715810">“typing is perhaps 0.5-1% of my programming
time”</a>. Programming is <em>thinking</em>, talking to people, planning,
researching, is what incarnations of person #2 are saying. And if you think your
keyboard is holding you back from thinking, well, you’re wrong.</p>

<p>I get that. I don’t write code the whole day either.</p>

<p>But here’s what I need to write and type besides code: commit messages, pull
request descriptions, emails, tickets, comments on tickets, code reviews,
documentation, Slack messages, notes, journal entries, RFCs, design documents,
requirements.</p>

<p>And being able to type fast and without much effort sure as hell helps. It lets
me get back to the thinking.</p>

<p>Effort, that’s the important one, not raw speed. It doesn’t matter if you can
type 90 words per minutes or 130, but if it takes you <em>effort</em> to type something
and, if given the choice, you’d rather not do it, then we have a problem.</p>

<p>Take me on my phone, for example. It takes me a lot of effort to type on it.
It’s not only that I’m slow because I can’t use more than two fingers, but every
third word is a typo. Or, even more infuriating, it’s the wrong word and I need
to correct autocorrect. Or I switched from English to German while typing and my
phone doesn’t know what an umlaut is anymore.</p>

<p>If you see me typing on my phone chances are you can also hear me producing an
angry growl-like sound.</p>

<p>Which is exactly why I don’t do it a lot. I barely use the note taking apps I
have, because I’d rather type on my computer, with a proper keyboard. I often
refrain from replying to messages if I don’t have to, because, yep, I’d have to
type those replies.</p>

<p>In other words: typing <em>is</em> a bottleneck for me.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me on my phone. Ever had a chat conversation with somebody who
wasn’t comfortable typing? Here’s what you get: short messages, acronyms, typos,
missing sentences. You can <em>read</em> how they struggled to type. I once had a
colleague who had the habit of walking to my desk saying “Ah, before I type all
that up, I thought I’d quickly tell you in person” where “all that” was three to
four paragraphs, at the most.</p>

<p>And that’s what this is about. If you’re not comfortable typing a lot and you’d
rather not write something down then typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck and you need to
fix it. Typing is not something you should need to think about.</p>

<p>Because wouldn’t it be a waste of time if you spend 99% of your time lying in a
hammock, thinking, but then choose not to write all of your ideas down, because
typing <em>is</em> the bottleneck?</p>

<article>
  <p>This blog post discusses the support for Rightward assignments in ruby.</p>

<h3 id="before">Before</h3>

<p>Historically, all of the early programming languages were designed by Mathematicians. It’s a common practice in mathematics to say <code>let x = 4y + z</code>, which is read as let <code>x</code> be equal to <code>4y + z</code>.</p>

<p>So the same pattern is followed in programming languages as well.</p>

<p>For assigning a value to a variable, we typically do <code>age = 42</code> in ruby. Here we are assigning the <code>Rvalue</code> <code>42</code> to an <code>Lvalue</code> <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>While the above pattern has become standardized, it feels somewhat unnatural as we read most of the spoken languages from left to right.</p>

<p>We were not able to do something like <code>42 =&gt; age</code>.</p>

<h3 id="after">After</h3>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1b2d351b216661e03d497dfdce216e0d51474664#diff-8312ad0561ef661716b48d09478362f3">changes</a>, Ruby supports the <strong>Right ward assignments</strong> as demonstrated below.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>box_height</span> <span># This is equivalent to box_height = 3</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a look at few more examples:</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>traits</span>
  <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>traits</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>



<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional notes:</h3>

<p>There are already some languages which support rightward assignment.</p>

<p><code>TI-BASIC’s</code> uses STO (“store”) operation to achieve this, as demonstrated below:</p>

<p><code>42→age</code></p>

<p><code>R language</code> also has a similar way of doing this  <code>42 -&gt; age</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is added as an experimental feature in Ruby, which means it could be removed depending on the feedback received.</p>

		<p><em>This is an article by <strong>Thaddeus Michaels</strong>, who is a data scientist.</em><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p>A few things to make clear up front: I am not ideologically opposed to state intervention in areas of public health; I believe vaccines work; I believe Covid-19 is a real, somewhat dangerous disease which emerged in China in late 2019 and can be fatal; I’m not a Brexiteer or libertarian.</p>
<p>But I believe a form of mass hysteria has spread through society in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rational thought about costs and benefits has evaporated, and we have done more harm than good in our response.</p>
<p>Instead of a conspiracy theory, here is a plausible ‘good faith’ explanation for why this may have happened.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Confirmation bias and pet theories</strong></p>
<p>The origins of the hysteria, in my view, lay with many researchers and public intellectuals who had been theorising about ‘The Great Pandemic’ for a long time.</p>
<p>It may not have been a mainstream topic of conversation, but anyone interested in fields like medicine, complexity science, and risk analysis would have heard chatter about the imminent pandemic threat.</p>
<p>We’d had a few false alarms in bird flu (2003) and swine flu (2009), and some nasty regional outbreaks of diseases like SARS (2002-04) and Ebola (2013-16).</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that some people were highly attuned to the possibility of a deadly pandemic. They had developed toolkits for forecasting and responding to it, often based on mathematical models they had fallen in love with.</p>
<p>The risk, as always in politics, is that you fight your last war. Many of the most draconian responses to Covid-19 have been promoted by people who cut their teeth on Ebola and SARS outbreaks.</p>
<p>Both those diseases are far more deadly than Covid-19 – making it easier to persuade the public to comply with tough control measures, and heavily penalising any society that fails to control an outbreak.</p>
<p>As anecdotal information arrived from China, Iran and Italy that something very bad was happening (and let’s be honest, it was!) this information wasn’t weighed up properly. People didn’t pause to think about whether the disease would behave like this in all settings, but began to accept that it was <em>The Great Pandemic</em> that everyone had feared.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Availability bias and tunnel vision</strong></p>
<p>The next step, after enough influential people had succumbed to confirmation bias, was to start distorting the information pipeline.</p>
<p>This wasn’t fake news, it was just a massive imbalance of information.</p>
<p>As the threat from Covid-19 became apparent, there was a well-intentioned global effort to churn out Covid-19 data as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I doubt I was the only person to spend much of the early part of 2020 looking at Worldmeter time series of Covid-19 case and death counts in different countries.</p>
<p>John Burn-Murdoch at the FT produced a dazzling array of charts showing fatalities, introducing a lay audience to log-scale charts, and then publishing what he called ‘gold standard’ data on excess deaths.</p>
<p>It was very easy for anyone vaguely interested in data to become an expert of sorts, just by following a few Twitter accounts and reading the right newspapers.</p>
<p>But the catch was that the policy response to Covid-19 could not be judged solely on Covid-19 outcomes. We also needed to look at second order effects of each policy response: mental health problems, cancer deaths, job losses, mortgage defaults, domestic violence, child abuse, and so on.</p>
<p>Much of the data needed to judge these second order effects <em>still</em> does not exist. The urgent ramp up of Covid-19 data was not matched by any urgency to collect and publish this data at a similar rate. So the cost-benefit analysis is inherently biased in favour of Covid-19 preventation.</p>
<p>With public health officials judged exclusively on their performance on Covid-19 KPIs, tunnel vision was naturally going to set in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Clickbait journalism and influencer attention seeking</strong></p>
<p>As the availability of Covid-19 data ramped up, this also created an active online market for fear porn.</p>
<p>We had uninformed attention seekers like Piers Morgan flying the flag for extreme reactions to Covid-19 on the basis of their own very rudimentary understanding of the statistics.</p>
<p>A particularly bizarre moment was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C98FmoZVbjs&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">a debate on Channel 4 News on 12<sup>th</sup> March 2020</a> where Tomas Pueyo (a ‘growth hacker’ at an e-learning company) debated John Edmunds (a professor of epidemiology and SAGE member).</p>
<p>Pueyo had written a blog post <em><a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now</a></em>, which had attracted global attention. It was superficially plausible, but riddled with overreaching arguments, overconfident predictions, and false equivalences.</p>
<p>On the programme, Edmunds says that we are past the stage where eradication is feasible, and that “the only way to stop this epidemic is indeed herd immunity” (one assumes he means via either infection-recovery or vaccination).</p>
<p>Pueyo, who has only recently appointed himself as an expert on pandemics, theatrically holds his head in his hands. “This is like deciding, you know what, this forest might burn, so let’s cut a third of it! This is crazy!”</p>
<p>He then says: “So you’re saying we want to kill 200,000 people in the UK!”</p>
<p>This kind of analysis quickly became mainstream. Initial case fatality rates (heavily skewed by early treatment failures and the virus’s higher spread in hospitals and care homes) were naively extrapolated to wider society.</p>
<p>Crude, back-of-a-fag-packet calculations and hand waving arguments were granted authority, because informed critics could not match the hysterics for eye-bulging certainty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, social media platforms are a major reason why so many countries collectively lost their nerve. Pueyo’s accessible blog post spread like wildfire. Worldometer charts allowed people to naively compare their progress against other countries, and force change. Only Sweden held out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Politicisation and assumptions of bad faith</strong></p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin was the sifting of Covid-19 viewpoints into old political tribes.</p>
<p>Lockdown scepticism started to become a Brexiteer/libertarian position. Strong support for masking and social distancing was associated with so-called ‘Karens’.</p>
<p>Teachers’ unions saw an opportunity to undermine the Johnson government by nonsensically advocating for prolonged school closures, despite plenty of evidence from other European countries that this was unnecessary.</p>
<p>In the States, anything Trump said about coronavirus was instinctively added to the list of wrongthink by his political opponents, even when he accidentally said sensible things.</p>
<p>Lest we forget, Trump was one of the first advocates for restricting travel from China when the outbreak first happened – in hindsight, a sensible move.</p>
<p>We now have Twitter dominated by Covid tribes like #WearAMask, #ClapForTheNHS and #KBF (Keep Britain Free). They each draw from predictable ends of the political spectrum. It is all very reminiscent of Brexit.</p>
<p>It is challenging to have a nuanced discussion about Covid-19 on social media now, although there are a handful of scientists who have held firm – <a href="https://twitter.com/BallouxFrancois">Prof Francois Balloux</a> is one of the most impressive at neither downplaying the genuine threat from Covid-19, nor succumbing to tunnel vision.</p>
<p><strong>How do we escape this?</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, we run into the old reality that ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. Covid-19 hysteria is an emotional, identity-driven position masquerading as a set of facts.</p>
<p>It has spread so widely, though, that there are few control cases available for comparison, besides Sweden.</p>
<p>Sweden is a useful example for lockdown sceptics, but it is too easy for pro-lockdown voices to dismiss Sweden as an outlier country that anyway experienced a higher death toll than neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>On individual questions like school closures, we are starting to see some emerging evidence that the hysterics were wrong. Perhaps similar evidence will emerge soon on measures like track and trace, mask wearing, and so on.</p>
<p>Many of the ‘Covid Hero’ countries like New Zealand will see that status diminish as they find themselves vulnerable to imported outbreaks. That may help to recalibrate the debate.</p>
<p>Sadly, though, I fear it will only be the rampant social, economic and psychological destruction we inflict on the world’s youth that will eventually up-end the mainstream consensus.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is the article I wish I had read when I started coding. Programming is about solving problems and here I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques, with code samples, big O analysis, and challenges so that you can master them.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.yourdevopsguy.com/how-to-ace-coding-interviews-the-ultimate-guide-ckcxekdxp00bqois16r59a9c1">this article</a>, I outlined a high-level strategy to prepare for your next coding interview as well as the top mistakes to avoid. Here, I will dive deep into 20 problem-solving techniques that you must know to excel at your next interview. They have helped me at work too and even given me ideas for a side project I am working on. Also, the last section includes a <strong>step-by-step guide to learn (not memorize) any algorithm or data structure</strong>, with 2 examples.</p>
<p>I have grouped these techniques in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointer based</li>
<li>Recursion based</li>
<li>Sorting and searching</li>
<li>Extending basic data structures</li>
<li>Miscellanea</li>
</ul>
<p>I will explain each of them, show how to apply them to coding problems, and leave you some exercises so that you can practice on your own.</p>
<p>This list is part of the study notes that I took before I applied to Amazon. I hope they will be as useful to you as they have been to me.</p>
<p>For your convenience, I have copied here the problem statements, but I have left links to all of the exercises. You can copy-paste my solution and play around with it. I strongly recommend you code your solution and see if it passes the tests.</p>
<p>Some of the questions are better explained through an image or diagram. For these, I have left a comment asking you to open the link to get a graphical description of the problem.</p>

<h2 id="1-two-pointers">1. Two Pointers</h2>
<p>This technique is very useful on <em>sorted arrays</em> and arrays whose elements we want to <em>group</em>. </p>
<p>The idea is to use two (or more pointers) to split the array into different areas or groups based on some condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elements smaller than, equal to and greater than a certain value</li>
<li>Elements whose sum is too small or too large</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples will help you understand this principle.</p>
<h3 id="two-sumhttpsleetcodecomproblemstwo-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/">Two sum</a></h3>
<p>Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.</li>
<li>You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9</li>
<li>Output: [1,2]</li>
<li>Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Since the array <em>a</em> is sorted, we know that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest sum is equal to the sum of the last 2 elements</li>
<li>The smallest sum is equal to the sum of the first 2 elements </li>
<li>For any index <em>i</em> in [0, a.size() - 1) =&gt; a[i + 1] &gt;= a[i]</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we can design the following algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep 2 pointers: <em>l</em>, starting at the first element of the array, and <em>r</em> starting at to the last.</li>
<li>If the sum of a[l] + a[r] is smaller than our target, we increment l by one (to change the smallest operand in the addition for another one equal or larger than it at <em>l+1</em>); if it is larger than the target, we decrease r by one (to change our largest operand for another one equal or smaller at <em>r-1</em>).</li>
<li>We do this until a[l] + a[r] equals our target or l and r point to the same element (since we cannot use the same element twice) or have crossed, indicating there is no solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple C++ implementation:</p>
<pre><code><span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; twoSum(<span>const</span> <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; a, <span>int</span> target) {
        <span>int</span> l = <span>0</span>, r = a.size() - <span>1</span>;
        <span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt; sol;
        <span>while</span>(l &lt; r) {
            <span>const</span> <span>int</span> sum = a[l] + a[r];
            <span>if</span>(target == sum){
                sol.push_back(l + <span>1</span>); 
                sol.push_back(r + <span>1</span>); 
                <span>break</span>;
            } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (target &gt; sum) {
                ++l;
            } <span>else</span> {
                --r;
            }
        }
        <span>return</span> sol;
    }
</code></pre><p>The time complexity is O(N), since we may need to traverse the N elements of the array to find the solution. </p>
<p>The space complexity is O(1), since we only need two pointers, regardless of how many elements the array contains.</p>
<p>There are other ways of solving this problem (using a hash table, for example), but I have used it just as an illustration of the two pointer technique.</p>
<h4 id="challenges">Challenges</h4>
<p>Here are two variations of this exercise: <a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">three sum</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/">four sum</a>. They can be solved similarly by <strong>reducing</strong> them to this very same problem. </p>
<p>This is a very common technique: <strong>transform a problem whose solution you don't know to a problem that you can solve</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="remove-duplicates-from-arrayhttpsleetcodecomproblemsremove-duplicates-from-sorted-array"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/">Remove duplicates from array</a></h3>
<p>Given a sorted array, nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.</p>
<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [1,1,2],</li>
<li>Output = 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],</li>
<li>Output = 5</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The array is <strong>sorted</strong> and we want to move duplicates to the end of the array, which sounds a lot like <strong>grouping based on some condition</strong>. How would you solve this problem using two pointers?</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need one pointer to iterate through the array, <em>i</em>.</li>
<li>And a second pointer, <em>n</em>, one to define the area that contains no duplicates: [0,n].</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic is as follows. If the values of the elements at index <em>i</em> (except <em>i</em> = 0) and <em>i-1</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same, we don’t do anything - this duplicate will be overwritten by the next unique element in <em>a</em>.</li>
<li>Different: we add <em>a[i]</em> to the section of the array that contains no duplicates - delimited by <em>n</em>, and increment n by one.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>removeDuplicates</span><span>(<span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; nums)</span> </span>{
    <span>if</span>(nums.empty())
        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    <span>int</span> n = <span>0</span>;
    <span>for</span>(<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; nums.size(); ++i){
        <span>if</span>(i == <span>0</span> || nums[i] != nums[i - <span>1</span>]){
            nums[n++] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    <span>return</span> n;
    }
</code></pre><p>This problem has linear time complexity and constant space complexity (it is usually the case for problems solved using this technique).</p>
<h3 id="sort-colorshttpsleetcodecomproblemssort-colors"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/">Sort colors</a></h3>
<p>Given an array with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
Note: You are not supposed to use the library's sort function for this problem.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]</li>
<li>Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The groups this time are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller than 1</li>
<li>Equal to 1</li>
<li>Larger than 1</li>
</ul>
<p>What we can achieve with 3 pointers. </p>
<p>This implementation is a bit tricky, so make sure you test it thoroughly.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>sortColors</span><span>(<span>vector</span>&lt;<span>int</span>&gt;&amp; nums)</span> </span>{
    <span>int</span> smaller = <span>0</span>, eq = <span>0</span>, larger = nums.size() - <span>1</span>;
    <span>while</span>(eq &lt;= larger){
        <span>if</span>(nums[eq] == <span>0</span>){
            swap(nums[smaller], nums[eq]);
            ++smaller; ++eq;
        } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (nums[eq] == <span>2</span>) {
            swap(nums[larger], nums[eq]);
            --larger;
        } <span>else</span> {
            eq++;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Since need to traverse the array to sort it, the time complexity is O(N). The space complexity is O(1).</p>
<p>Just as a curiosity, this is an instance of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem">National Dutch flag</a> problem described by Dijkstra.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-n-th-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-listhttpswwwgeeksforgeeksorgnth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/">Remove the n-th node from the end of a linked list</a></h3>
<p>Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n-th node from the end of the Linked List.</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>This is one of the most common variations of the two-pointer technique: introducing <strong>an offset</strong> so that one of the pointers reaches a certain condition, the other one is in the position you are interested in.</p>
<p>In this case, if we move one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, n times and then start advancing both at the same time by one node, when <em>f</em> reaches the end of the list the other pointer, <em>s</em>, will point to the node right before the node we want to delete.</p>
<p>Make sure you define what n = 1 means (last element or the element before the last element?), and avoid off-by-one errors.</p>
<p>The time and space complexity are the same as the previous problems'.</p>
<h2 id="2-pointers-moving-at-different-speeds">2. Pointers moving at different speeds</h2>
<p>Now, you will have two pointers moving at different <em>speeds</em>: at every iteration, one of the pointers will advance one node and the other will advance two nodes. We can use this variation to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to the middle element of a linked list</li>
<li>Detect cycles in a linked list</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, it will become clearer once I present some examples.</p>
<h3 id="find-the-middle-node-of-a-linked-list-of-unknown-sizehttpsleetcodecomproblemsmiddle-of-the-linked-list"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/">Find the middle node of a linked list of unknown size</a></h3>
<p>Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of the list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: [1,2,3,4,5]</li>
<li>Output: Node 3 from this list</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>Solving this problem in 2 passes is easy: on the first pass we compute the size of the list, <em>L</em>, and on the second pass we only advance <em>L/2</em> nodes to find the element at the middle of the list. This approach has linear complexity in time and constant in space.</p>
<p>How can we use 2 pointers to find the middle element in one single pass?</p>
<p>If one of the pointers, <em>f</em>, moves twice as fast as the other one <em>s</em>, when <em>f</em> reaches the end, <em>s</em> will be in the middle of the list.</p>
<p>Here's my solution in C++. Make sure you take into account edge cases (empty list, lists of odd and even sizes, etc) when you test your code.</p>
<pre><code>ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
       ListNode* slow = head;
       ListNode* fast = head;

       <span>while</span> (fast != nullptr &amp;&amp; fast-&gt;<span>next</span> != nullptr) {
           slow = slow-&gt;<span>next</span>;
           fast = fast-&gt;<span>next</span>-&gt;<span>next</span>;
       }
       <span>return</span> slow; 
    }
</code></pre><h2 id="detect-cycle-in-a-linked-listhttpsleetcodecomproblemslinked-list-cycle"><a target="_blank" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/">Detect cycle in a linked list</a></h2>
<p>Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it. To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1</li>
<li>Output: true</li>
<li>Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the second node.</li>

<p>
 On June 26th 2017, Daniel was denied to travel to the US - while still having
 a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. When
 subsequently applying for a visa instead, there has been no response for over
 two years. (To <i>visit</i>, not to apply for permanent residency.)

</p><p> FAQ </p>
<p>
<a href="#long">Do you know why this takes so long?</a>
</p><div>
<p> No. They've just informed me "someone is working on it" and that it "may take a long time" but without qualifying what that means.
</p><p> I've talked to several persons who've experienced similar situations, and
  I've learned about waiting times up to 20 months until a definite "no". I used
  to think of that as a sort of "worst case" waiting time. Now we know it can
  take longer...
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#esta">Why don't you just apply for an ESTA?</a>
</p><p>
  I already did and they denied me that. See one of the <a href="#images">images below</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why did they deny you ESTA?
</p><p>
  I don't know as they won't tell. And I also don't know why they can't respond to my visa application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#working">So, someone is working on it?</a>
</p><p>
  Allegedly, yes. I'm sure that person must be working very hard...
</p>
<p>
<a href="#eventually">Do you think they will grant you a visa eventually?</a>
</p><div>
<p>
  No. I've been in contact with many people who have been in similar
  situations such as this, as well as many people who have applied for visas
  for very complicated matters, and it is basically unheard of that it would
  take this long time and still end up with a positive response in the end.
</p><p>
  Someone emailed me and explained how they got their visa approved after 10
  months waiting - so it obviously <i>can</i> happen after a fairly
  long time!
</p></div>
<p>
<a name="#arab">Did you travel to any arab countries, middle-east, North Korea, Sudan, Iran or Iraq?</a>
</p><p>
 No.
</p>
<p>
<a name="#ever">Did you ever visit the US?</a>
</p><div>
<p> Yes, I've visted the US around a dozen times over a time period of almost
 twenty years. I've applied and gotten ESTA permissions several times. I have
 many friends living and working in the US.
</p><p> My latest visit to the US was in December 2016 - using the same ESTA and
 passport I subsequently wanted to use in the summer of 2017 when I was first
 denied travelling to the US.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#blocked">How many trips have this blocked you from taking so far?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I've been invited personally to several meetings in the US that I couldn't
 attend. (excluding IETF, HTTPbis or QUIC meetings)
</p><ol>
<li> San Francisco June 2017. Mozilla All Hands.
</li><li> San Francisco June 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> San Francisco October 2018. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Orlando, Florida December 2018. Mozilla All hands.
</li><li> Portland, Oregon January 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> California, March 2019. Conference speaking engagement.
</li><li> Summer of 2019. Wedding.
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#employer">Can't your employer help you?</a>
</p><p> We've already tried all available ways to get information or otherwise
bring this effort forward. To no avail.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#Mozilla">Will Mozilla move more meetings outside of the US?</a>
</p><p> Yes. Several of the coming All hands are now planned and scheduled to
happen outside of the US, for example in Canada and Germany. But I will not be
there to experience them since I quit Mozilla in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
Will your visa situation change when you've quit Mozilla?
</p><p> Unfortunately, there is no reason to suspect or hope so.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#lost">Maybe they lost your application?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I emailed them in July 2019 just to make sure they just hadn't
 forgot about my case or similar over the past year, and I received their
 reply on August 1st 2019. The response said "I have forwarded your email to
 my supervisor to highlight the problem."  - but then nothing more came.
</p><p> I emailed them again on January 28, 2020.<br>
<img src="https://daniel.haxx.se/media/651-days-email.png">
</p><p>
 They responded very politely:
 </p><pre>Dear Sir,
&nbsp;
All applications are processed in the most expeditious manner
possible. While we understand your frustration, we are required to follow
immigration law regarding visa issuances. This process cannot be expedited or
circumvented. Rest assured that we will contact you as soon as the
administrative processing is concluded.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#likely">What do you think is the most likely explanation for this treatment?</a>
</p><div>
<p> I think one of the likelier explantions is that someone somewhere has
 found my name and my code used in some evil or malicious manner and drawn the
 wrong conclusions about how my code ended up there or how I could've been
 involved. Like for example in some malware, virus or other attack software. I
 make tools and code available for free and openly and sometimes those are
 unfortunately used in ways I don't condone.
</p><p> Since they won't tell me why, basically all theories are equally likely.
 We just won't know.
</p></div>
<p>
Any other plausible explanations?
</p><div>
<p> People have mentioned my domain name <b>haxx.se</b> or suggested it is
because I've referred to myself as "a hacker" at times. I find that unlikely
since I used the domain and used the term for decades before this.
</p><p> Others have offered the explanation that the immigration authorities
might've decided that I violated the ESTA rules in a previous visit. I can of
course not know what they think, but I have not violated those rules.
</p></div>
<p>
<a href="#crime">Convicted of a crime?</a>
</p><p>
No, I've never been convicted of a crime in Sweden and not anywhere else. Not even
charged. Nor have I ever been involved in a lawsuit of any kind.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#license">Can you change the curl license?</a>
</p><div><p>
Lots of people suggest this, most probably in jest, but let me be perfectly
clear: no I won't change the curl license.
</p><ol>
 <li> excluding a specific user would make a license to not be open source anymore
 </li><li> curl has many more copyrights than mine, it would be hard
 </li><li> curl is bigger than me personally, I wouldn't do it anyway
</li></ol>
</div>
<p>
<a href="#covid">But Covid-19?</a>
</p><p>
During the Corona pandemic (starting in spring 2020), the US has closed its
borders for a lot of more people who otherwise would have been allowed
entry. I suspect the visa processing has slowed down during this period since
people can't go there anyway. But I have not been notified about anything and
I still expect to get a rejection at some point. Pandemic or not.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#officials">Have you contacted any US officials?</a>
</p><div><p>
A US citizen friend of mine sent the following text in an email to the
U.S. Congressman Gerry Connolly on September 3, 2020.
</p><pre>Dear Representative Gerry Connolly:
&nbsp;
Could you please help my friend Daniel Stenberg *finally* gain permission to
travel to the US? He has been denied permission to travel to the US for years,
yet there is no cause for it.
&nbsp;
On June 26, 2017, Mr. Stenberg was denied to travel to the US, even though he
had a valid ESTA and passport. He was then denied ESTA on April 3, 2018. He
then applied for a visa in April 2018, and has *still* not heard anything.
&nbsp;
This is especially galling because is a widely-known leader in the computer
community. He developed and maintains the "curl" program, a program used
worldwide by many software developers and computer system administrators. In
October 2017 he won the "Polhem prize" for his work on curl; in that ceremony
the Swedish king personally handed Daniel a gold medal. In February 2019 he
joined wolfSSL, an American company (he's their only Swedish hire), and yet
he's still not allowed to travel to the US.
&nbsp;
Perhaps there is a confusion about the word "hacker". In the computer
community, a "hacker" is NOT someone who breaks into computers, a hacker
is "a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
particular."  ( IETF RFC 1983, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1983).

Mr. Stenberg does *not* break into computers without authorization.
&nbsp;
At the least, the State Department should have asked questions instead of
reflexively denying entry to a world leader in the computer industry.
&nbsp;

 <p><span> Jan 22, 2020</span></p>
<p><img data-src=" /assets/pages/design_patterns_book/bookcover_200px.jpg" alt=" Book cover" src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/bookcover_200px.jpg"> This blog post contains an excerpt from my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Design-Patterns-Julia-comprehensive-ebook/dp/B07SHV9PVV">Hands-on Design Patterns and Best Practices with Julia</a>, published by Packt Publishing in January 2020.  This is my first book, and I have spent months of my weekend time to do the research and write about various patterns pioneered by other expert Julia programmers.  I also feel honored to have Stefan Karpinski write forewords for the book.</p>
<p>If you like the content below, you can support me by buying the book (ISBN: 183864881X), telling your buddies about the book, or even just sending me a note via the official JuliaLang Slack. In addition, any constructive criticism are pleasantly welcomed.  <em>After all, life is a continuous learning process.</em></p>
<p>The Holy Traits pattern is one that I found most interesting with the Julia language as it fully leverages the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9HwsxE1OY&amp;t=2m18s">multiple dispatch</a> feature.  <strong><em>Happy reading!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The holy traits pattern has an interesting name. Some people also call it the <strong>Tim Holy Traits Trick (THTT)</strong>. The pattern is named after <a href="https://github.com/timholy">Tim Holy</a>, who is a long-time contributor to the Julia language and ecosystem.</p>
<p>What are <strong>traits</strong>? In a nutshell, a trait corresponds to the behavior of an object. For example, birds and butterflies can fly, so they both have the <em>CanFly</em> trait. Dolphins and turtles can swim, so they both have the <em>CanSwim</em> trait. A duck can fly and swim, so it has both the <em>CanFly</em> and <em>CanSwim</em> traits. Traits are typically binary – you either exhibit the trait or not – although that is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Why do we want traits? Traits can be used as a formal contract about how a data type can be used. For example, if an object has the <em>CanFly</em> trait, then we would be quite confident that the object has some kind of <code>fly</code> method defined. Likewise, if an object has the <em>CanSwim</em> trait, then we can probably call some kind of <code>swim</code> function.</p>
<p>Let's get back to programming. The Julia language doesn't have any built-in support for traits. However, the language is versatile enough for developers to use traits with the help of the multiple dispatch system. In this section, we will look into how this can be done with the special technique known as <strong>holy traits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case"><a href="#exploring_the_personal_asset_management_use_case">Exploring the personal asset management use case</a></h2>
<p>When designing reusable software, we often create abstractions as data types and associate behaviors with them. One way to model behaviors is to leverage a type hierarchy. Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a>, we should be able to substitute a type with a subtype when a function is called.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the type hierarchy for managing personal assets.</p>
<p><img data-src=" /assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png" alt=" Personal Asset Type Hierarchy" src="https://ahsmart.com/assets/pages/design_patterns_book/abstract_type_hier4.png"></p><p>We can define a function called <code>value</code> for determining the value of any asset. Such a function can be applied to all the types in the <code>Asset</code> hierarchy if we assume that all the asset types have some kind of monetary value attached to them. Following that line of thought, we can say that almost every asset exhibits the <em>HasValue</em> trait.</p>
<p>Sometimes, behaviors can only be applied to certain types in the hierarchy. For example, what if we want to define a <code>trade</code> function that only works with liquid investments? In that case, we would define trade functions for <code>Investment</code> and <code>Cash</code> but not for <code>House</code> and <code>Apartments</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A liquid investment refers to a security instrument that can be traded easily in the open market. The investor can quickly convert a liquid instrument into cash and vice versa. In general, most investors would like a portion of their investment to be liquid in the case of an emergency. Investments that are not liquid are called illiquid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Programmatically, how do we know which asset types are liquid? One way is to check the type of the object against a list of types that represent liquid investments. Suppose that we have an array of assets and need to find out which one can be traded quickly for cash. In this situation, the code may look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa Investment || asset isa Cash
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>The if-condition in the preceding code is a bit ugly, even in this toy example. If we have more types in the condition, then it gets worse. Of course, we can create a union type to make it a little better:</p>
<pre><code>const LiquidInvestments = Union{Investment, Cash}

function show_tradable_assets(assets::Vector{Asset})
    for asset in assets
        if asset isa LiquidInvestments
            println("Yes, I can trade ", asset)
        else
            println("Sorry, ", asset, " is not tradable")
        end
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>There are still a few issues with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The union type has to be updated whenever we add a new liquid asset type. This kind of maintenance is bad from a design perspective because the programmer must remember to update this union type whenever a new type is added to the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This union type is not available for extension. If other developers want to reuse our trading library, then they may want to add new asset types. However, they cannot change our definition of the union type because they do not own the source code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The if-then-else logic may be repeated in many places in our source, whenever we need to do things differently for liquid and illiquid assets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These problems can be solved using the <strong>holy traits</strong> pattern.</p>
<h2 id="implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern"><a href="#implementing_the_holy_traits_pattern">Implementing the Holy Traits pattern</a></h2>
<p>To illustrate the concept of this pattern, we will start looking into the following personal asset data types:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type Asset end

abstract type Property &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Investment &lt;: Asset end
abstract type Cash &lt;: Asset end

abstract type House &lt;: Property end
abstract type Apartment &lt;: Property end

abstract type FixedIncome &lt;: Investment end
abstract type Equity &lt;: Investment end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> type is at the top of the hierarchy and has the <code>Property</code>, <code>Investment</code>, and <code>Cash</code> subtypes. At the next level, <code>House</code> and <code>Apartment</code> are subtypes of <code>Property</code>, while <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code> are subtypes of <code>Investment</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let's define some concrete types:</p>
<pre><code>struct Residence &lt;: House
   location
end

struct Stock &lt;: Equity
    symbol
    name
end

struct TreasuryBill &lt;: FixedIncome
    cusip
end

struct Money &lt;: Cash
    currency
    amount
end</code></pre>
<p>What do we have here? Let's take a look at these data types in more details:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <code>Residence</code> is a house that someone lives in and has a location.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>Stock</code> is an equity investment, which is identified by a trading symbol and the name of the company.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <code>TreasuryBill</code> is a short-term government-issued form of security in the United States, and it is identified with a standard identifier called CUSIP.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Money</code> is just cash, and we want to store the currency and respective amount here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we have not annotated the types for the fields because they aren't important for illustrating the trait concept here.</p>
<h2 id="defining_the_trait_type"><a href="#defining_the_trait_type">Defining the trait type</a></h2>
<p>When it comes to investments, we can distinguish between ones that can be sold for cash easily in the open market and ones that take considerably more effort and time to convert into cash. Things that can easily be converted into cash within several days are known as being <strong>liquid</strong>, while the hard-to-sell ones are known as being <strong>illiquid</strong>. For example, stocks are liquid while a residence is not.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to do is define the traits themselves:</p>
<pre><code>abstract type LiquidityStyle end
struct IsLiquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end
struct IsIlliquid &lt;: LiquidityStyle end</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Traits are nothing but regular data types in Julia!</em></strong> The overall concept of the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> trait is just an abstract type. The specific traits, <code>IsLiquid</code> and <code>IsIlliquid</code>, are coded as concrete types without any fields.</p>
<h2 id="identifying_traits"><a href="#identifying_traits">Identifying traits</a></h2>
<p>The next step is to assign data types to these traits. Conveniently, Julia allows us to bulk-assign traits to an entire subtype tree using the <code>&lt;:</code> operator in the function signature:</p>
<pre><code># Default behavior is illiquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type) = IsIlliquid()

# Cash is always liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Cash}) = IsLiquid()

# Any subtype of Investment is liquid
LiquidityStyle(::Type{&lt;:Investment}) = IsLiquid()</code></pre>
<p>There is no standard naming convention for traits, but my research seems to indicate that package authors tend to use either "Style" or "Trait" as the suffix for trait types.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how we can interpret these three lines of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the types illiquid by default. Note that we could have done this the other way round and made everything liquid by default. This decision is arbitrary and depends on the specific use case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code> liquid, which includes the concrete <code>Money</code> type. The notation of <code>::Type{&lt;:Cash}</code> indicates all the subtypes of <code>Cash</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have chosen to make all the subtypes of <code>Investment</code> liquid. This includes all the subtypes of <code>FixedIncome</code> and <code>Equity</code>, which covers <code>Stock</code> in this example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing_trait_behavior"><a href="#implementing_trait_behavior">Implementing trait behavior</a></h2>
<p>Now that we can tell which types are liquid and which are not, we can define methods that take objects with those traits. First, let's do something really simple:</p>
<pre><code># The thing is tradable if it is liquid
tradable(x::T) where {T} = tradable(LiquidityStyle(T), x)
tradable(::IsLiquid, x) = true
tradable(::IsIlliquid, x) = false</code></pre>
<p>In Julia, types are first-class citizens. The <code>tradable(x::T) where {T}</code> signature captures the type of argument as <code>T</code>. Since we have already defined the <code>LiquidityStyle</code> function, we can derive whether the passed argument exhibits the <code>IsLiquid</code> or <code>IsIlliquid</code> trait. So, the first <code>tradable</code> method simply takes the return value of <code>LiquidityStyle(T)</code> and passes it as the first argument for the other two <code>tradable</code> methods. This simple example demonstrates the dispatch effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might be wondering why we don't take <code>::Type{&lt;: Asset}</code> as an argument for the default trait function. Doing so makes it more restrictive as the default value would only be available for types that are defined under the Asset type hierarchy. This may or …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                    <p>This is part-2 of the case study on Boost Collections and Recoveries using Machine Learning (MLBR). </p><p>To read part-1, click <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p1/">here</a>.</p><blockquote><em><u>Disclaimer:</u> This case study is solely an educational exercise and information contained in this case study is to be used only as a case study example for teaching purposes.

In this case we collected various types of data related to customer from data warehouse and OLTP repositories. We collected data related to customer demographics, data about existing recoveries base, collection agents, external agencies data, lawyers data, call logs, payment history etc. </p><p>Here is the high level data pipeline for MLBR:</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/09/mlbr_dataflow.png"><figcaption>High level Data pipeline for Boost Collection and Recoveries using Machine Learning (MLBR)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="4-2-data-preparation">4.2. &nbsp;Data Preparation</h3><p>After gathering and exploring the data, we came up with three types of variables as an input to our model.</p><ul><li><em>Simple Variable:</em> These are direct field from the data source.</li><li><em>Complex Variable:</em> These are based on some logic or calculations.</li><li><em>Engineered Variables:</em> These are prepared after doing extensive exploratory analysis or by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA).</li></ul><p>There were over 40 variables gathered for the input data set. Some of the variables are listed below:</p><ul><li>Market of the client</li><li>Top product of the client</li><li>Year of first account open date</li><li>Client tenure</li><li>Written off year</li><li>Number of months account remained in collection</li><li>Number of months account lived before written off</li><li>Number of months taken to resolve. Arbitrary infinity value of not resolved cases.</li><li>Total write off amount</li><li>Total recovered amount</li><li>Yet to recover amount</li><li>Percentage recovered</li><li>Percentage yet to recover</li><li>Amount of first recovery payment</li><li>Percentage of first recovery payment</li><li>ETA days to receive first payment</li><li>Total number of accounts customer holds with the company.</li><li>Number of settled accounts</li><li>Number of yet to recover accounts</li><li>Percentage of number of accounts settled</li><li>Current external agency name</li><li>Current lawyer code</li><li>Number of agents worked</li><li>Repayment Score: (Feature Engineering) This variable calculates the repayment power of the customer based on historical data.</li><li>Collection Score: (Feature Engineering) This variable calculates the behavior score of the customer.</li><li>Expert Score: (Feature Engineering). This variable provides subject matter expert rating about the customer. </li><li>Risk Level Score provided by application team. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Flag for workable or not workable cases.</li><li>Fully Resolved or Partial</li><li>Number of payments made &nbsp; </li></ul><p>Once data for all the variables has been collected, it cannot be used put directly for modeling. At this stage data is treated such that it can be used for modeling. Preparing the dataset is usually the hardest, most time consuming task of predictive analytics. Normally 70 to 80 percentage of the project time will be spent in this stage. The ultimate goal in this phase is to integrate and enrich the data into an analytical data set. The main activities includes</p><ul><li><strong>Data Acquiring</strong><br>Acquiring the data from all data sources and integrate to create a dataset i.e. Demoralization.</li><li><strong>Data Audit</strong><br>Use descriptive analytics techniques to have a comprehensive first look at the raw data for the initial data exploration. e.g. mean, median, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value etc.</li><li><strong>Missing Values</strong><br>Missing values are generally replaced with zeros. Need to agree with the business for the approach.</li><li><strong>Outlier Detection and Fixation</strong><br>Identify records having outliers or extreme values. Normally values with standard deviation greater than 3 or 5. These records can be put aside if the volume of outliers are less than 1% of the total data. K-means or average values are the other options. </li><li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong><br>Identify top features having strong relationship with target variable. Key variables that are effecting the churn. </li><li><strong>Data Balancing</strong><br>This defines the percentage of Recovered vs. Not Recovered at all customers in the training dataset. This biasing needs to be removed. Several techniques can be used which includes Random Undersampling, Random Oversampling, Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) etc. </li><li><strong>Data Imputation</strong> <br>techniques used are: <br>a) &nbsp;Categorization<br>b) &nbsp;Label Encoding<br>c) &nbsp;One-hot encoding/Dummy Coding</li><li><strong>Customer Segmentation (if required)</strong><br>Customers base can be segmented based on the product and market if required.</li></ul><p>Given below is the result after applying all the data treatments to the variables.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/09/image.png"><figcaption>Variables Summary</figcaption></figure><h3 id="4-3-exploratory-data-analysis">4.3. &nbsp;Exploratory Data Analysis</h3><p>After cleaning and munging the data, the next step in a machine learning project is to do exploratory data analysis (EDA). It involves numeric summaries, plots, aggregations, distributions, densities, reviewing all the levels of factor variables and applying general statistical methods. A clear understanding of the data provides the foundation for model selection, i.e. choosing the correct machine learning algorithm to solve your problem.</p><p>An extensive exploratory data analysis was done for MLBR which will be available in a separate series of articles soon.</p><h3 id="4-4-feature-engineering">4.4. &nbsp;Feature Engineering</h3><p>Feature engineering is the process of determining which predictor variables will contribute the most to the predictive power of a machine learning algorithm. There are two commonly used methods for making this selection – the Forward Selection Procedure starts with no variables in the model. You then iteratively add variables and test the predictive accuracy of the model until adding more variables no longer makes a positive effect. Next, the Backward Elimination Procedure begins with all the variables in the model. You proceed by removing variables and testing the predictive accuracy of the model.</p><p>Feature engineering is a give-and-take process with exploratory data analysis to provide much needed intuition about the data. It is also very important to have a domain expert at this stage. Risk Collection team has been very supportive in providing domain knowledge through out the project work. </p><p>During exploratory analysis of the historical data, we learned that determining account treatment is widespread in multiple phases of credit life cycle with each phase having several features. Therefore, by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, we came up with an idea of using predictive scores for different phases that should look at</p><ul><li>Behaviour score during collection phase (Collection Score)</li><li>Expert judgement (Expert Score)</li><li>Overall payment history analysis (Repayment Score)</li></ul><h3 id="4-4-1-collection-score">4.4.1. &nbsp;Collection Score</h3><p>Collection specific scoring is designed to predict what will happen in shorter timeframe – the next month or two – using data elements that are proven to be effective during collection phase. Collection Score is an engineered feature that looks at the customer behavior during collection period. The algorithm assigns a base score and then look at several parameters before arriving at the final collection score. The parameters includes number of calls made, contacts made, promise-to-pay (ptp) obtained, ptp kept rate, ptp broken rate, inbound calls, letters sent etc. The algorithm also look at number of ptp taken until first, second and third kept. Similarly, the number of days taken until first, second and third kept. &nbsp;Given below is the density distribution of the Collection Score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-2-repayment-score">4.4.2. &nbsp;Repayment Score</h3><p>This is an engineered feature that calculates customer repaying power by looking into customer historical data before it went to Charge Off. The algorithm developed to calculate Customer Repayment Score does this by looking into forward and backword movement of delinquency age buckets in the last three years before charge off. It looks for number of times customer defaulted, number of times customer recovered back to normal. Before arriving at the final repayment score, the algorithm also calculates customer lifetime value factor based on early stage delinquencies and late stage delinquencies. Given below is the density distribution of the repayment score for different segments of customers.</p><h3 id="4-4-3-expert-score">4.4.3. &nbsp;Expert Score</h3><p>In collections and recovery, determining how best to work accounts is often left to judgement. We acquired the expertise of collection and recoveries team and developed an Expert Opinion Scorecard to rate a customer based on the expert judgment. The scorecard primarily takes into consideration 19 independent variables related to customer demographics, market and product. Each variable is then rated by the expert based on the scale of 1-5 before calculating the final score. Here is the scale:</p><table>

<p><em>A Beginner’s Guide to the Internet’s Opportunity Machine</em></p>



<p>The internet is a money printer for smart people willing to share their ideas online.</p>



<p>Like any printer, it can take lots of trial and error to get it working. Occasionally it runs out of ink. Sometimes it jams. But when it works, it’s pure magic.</p>



<p>Indeed, if you’ve got an internet connection and a basic impulse to share your ideas, then you picked a great time to be alive. You can take advantage of two unprecedented opportunities:</p>



<ol><li><strong><a href="#one-person-media-companies">Building a profitable one-person media company</a></strong> around you and your ideas</li><li><strong><a href="#pour-gasoline-on-your-career">Pouring gasoline on your career</a></strong> by sharing your ideas online</li></ol>



<p>Neither opportunity is “easy” (you have to put in work over a long period of time) and you’ll need to be pretty enthusiastic about your ideas, but the upside is huge.</p>



<p>Also, these opportunities basically did not exist for all of human history…until now. Lucky us.</p>







<p>A one-person media company is exactly what it sounds like: it’s a profitable media company built around the ideas of a single person with at most one or two full-time employees, and often none at all.</p>



<p>This only became possible relatively recently.</p>



<div><p><b>Why Today Is Special</b></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s now pretty much free to distribute media thanks to the internet</li>
<li>Smartphones, tablets, and e-readers (i.e. always-on and always-online media devices) are affordable and most people have one on them at all times</li>
<li>Because the internet and internet-connected devices have been widely adopted, it’s now possible to reach nearly any niche on Earth (lots of new audiences!)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Production software and hardware have become wildly affordable and accessible</li>
</ul>

</div>



<p>The internet has created an opportunity to build a media company powered by the ideas of a single person, a payroll smaller than a convenience store, and revenues large enough that the company could trade on the NASDAQ.</p>



<p>It’s not easy to do. There’s a lot of competition. It can take a long time. But this is a post about possibilities, not probabilities.</p>



<p>Let’s have some fun and look at the upside potential of one-person media companies.</p>



<h2>The podcast that could trade on the NASDAQ</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="297" src="https://i2.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-05-01-at-7.57.35-PM.png?resize=580%2C297&amp;ssl=1" alt="Tim Ferriss and Tyler Cowen" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-05-01-at-7.57.35-PM.png?resize=1024%2C525&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-05-01-at-7.57.35-PM.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-05-01-at-7.57.35-PM.png?resize=768%2C394&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/stewfortier.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-05-01-at-7.57.35-PM.png?w=1162&amp;ssl=1 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>In 2007, a relatively unknown Tim Ferriss published <em>The 4-Hour Workweek</em>.</p>



<p>The book sold well and, year after year, Ferriss continued to blog and publish books and amassed “a monthly audience in the millions or tens of millions.” (<a href="https://tim.blog/2020/02/02/reasons-to-not-become-famous/">source</a>)</p>



<p>In 2014, he was burned out from writing books and decided to launch a podcast as <a href="https://tim.blog/2016/04/11/tim-ferriss-podcast-business/">an experiment</a>.</p>



<p>He used less than <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast-gear/">$1,000 worth of equipment</a> and distributed the podcast for free across major podcasting platforms.</p>



<p>He was able to acquire an early enthusiastic following thanks to the audience he had spent years building, but it didn’t take long before the podcast reached far beyond his existing blog and book fans.</p>



<p>Today, <em>The Tim Ferriss Show</em> is one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes.</p>



<p>What you might not know is that <em>The Tim Ferriss Show</em> generates enough revenue from advertising that, were it to make a few structural and governance changes, it would be eligible to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/nasdaq-listing-requirements/">trade on the NASDAQ</a> as a stand-alone company.</p>



<p>In the last three years alone, his podcast has generated <strong>nearly $17 million in revenue.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xStWqvSFccyFu0Z6wqk3Vfbj-GuxMKyf-uKfBTPJlxA/edit?usp=sharing">detailed breakdown</a> of <em>The Tim Ferriss Show’s </em>estimated revenue over the past few years:</p>







<p>Absolutely buck wild.</p>



<p>And it still costs next to nothing to produce the show…&nbsp;</p>



<p>He still uses just $1,000 worth of production equipment and famously leverages <a href="https://tim.blog/4-hour-workweek-tools/">internet-first tools and services</a> and a <a href="https://medium.com/@jasongrad/how-i-hired-a-virtual-assistant-stopped-wasting-my-time-and-achieved-10x-results-5feb430e652b">personal assistant</a> to manage the minutiae of his media empire while he’s largely free to focus on content production.</p>



<p>If he took the podcast public, its biggest expense would be the legal and regulatory overhead — not the operational costs of the underlying business.</p>



<p>While the top-line revenue of his podcast wouldn’t blow many NASDAQ companies out of the water, its margins would.</p>

<h2>How do one-person media companies make money?</h2>



<p>Not everybody can or wants to launch a wildly-successful podcast, and that’s fine.</p>



<p>There are plenty of ways to use the internet to build a profitable media company around your ideas. I’ll break down three popular strategies below.</p>



<p>The first two mostly require building a big audience like Ferriss, but the last one doesn’t and can get to profitability quickly.</p>



<h3>1. Advertising and affiliate marketing</h3>



<p>Tim Ferriss makes a mountain of money from advertising.</p>



<p>Companies want to pay to get in front of the big audience he’s built and they’re willing to shell out <a href="https://4hb.wufoo.com/forms/the-tim-ferriss-show-sponsor-interest-form/"><strong>$54,000</strong></a><strong> for a single ad slot</strong> in a single episode of his podcast.</p>



<p>He’s also made a killing with affiliate marketing…</p>



<p>He’ll partner up with a company and get paid whenever his readers or listeners purchase one of their products. You’ve probably noticed these links embedded throughout his blog and email newsletter.</p>



<p>If you can build a huge audience using the internet, you can have an extraordinary, low-overhead advertising business.</p>



<p>It’s not rocket science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, thankfully, it’s far from the only way to get paid to share your ideas online.</p>



<p><em>(p.s. if you don’t want to build a one-person media empire, you can skip ahead to <a href="#pour-gasoline-on-your-career">how sharing your ideas online can help accelerate your career</a>)</em></p>



<h3>2. Book sales and paid speaking gigs</h3>



<p>Many writers or semi-public figures make an envy-inducing living combining book sales with paid speaking gigs.</p>



<p>This used to only be a possibility for people who were already well-known or influential, or an incredibly lucky handful of promising writers who managed to land a book deal.</p>



<p>But now people are using the internet to build their own influence and let the publishers flock to <em>them</em>.  </p>



<p>James Clear is one example. </p>



<p>A few years ago, he was a nobody. </p>



<p>Here’s one of his first tweets:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Just a handful of likes. Sad!</p>



<p>But he used an aggressive SEO and <a href="http://mediashift.org/2015/01/how-a-self-help-blog-generated-100000-email-subscribers/">email list-building strategy</a> to go from unknown to internet-famous in just a few years.</p>



<p>Over <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1250538237225046018">715,000 people</a> now subscribe to his weekly newsletter alone. </p>



<p>Wild.</p>



<p>But despite having a big audience, he’s shunned advertising and has largely optimized his business around book sales and speaking engagements.</p>



<p>He leveraged his email list to get a book deal with a major publisher and launch the NY Times bestseller <a href="https://amzn.to/3b8mubD"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (over 1M copies sold).&nbsp;</p>



<p>And <strong>his</strong> <strong>speaking fees are now approaching that of some </strong><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/former-presidents-speaking-fees-3368127"><strong>former U.S. presidents</strong></a><strong>.</strong> </p>



<p>It costs <a href="https://speakerexchangeagency.com/portfolio/james-clear/">tens of thousands of dollars</a> to get him to show up to your next event — a fee that he’s been able to increase in lockstep with his audience growth.</p>

<p>The one big drawback of the book/speaking and advertising models are that they typically need a big audience before they start working well.</p>



<p>There’s a third business model, though, that doesn’t require an army of enthusiastic fans and is filled with success stories…</p>



<h3>3. Paid content and online courses</h3>



<p>The internet is filled with people you’ve never heard of who are making a living, and in many cases a <em>killing</em>, sharing their expertise on a narrow, deep topic.</p>



<p>They’ll likely never make as much as a Tim Ferriss, but I mean who cares? There are some stunning success stories of no-name people striking gold within a niche.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> is one. He’s built a one-person media company around his programming tutorials, online classes, and e-books.</p>



<p>Check out his sales over the past 4 years (the 2nd tweet below):</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yep +1 have sold $4m worth of PDFs/videos to developers since I started working on my first book in 2016. Developers are an amazing audience 👍🏻</p>— Adam Wathan (@adamwathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1244654205836632069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He did not hire legions of full-time employees to help him hit $4 million in sales. He just kept pushing out educational videos and PDFs that he produced and distributed himself.</p>



<p>And, by the way, he’s no Steven Spielberg. Many of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ">his videos</a> are him just recording a screencast for 30 minutes as he debugs some obscure programming issue.</p>



<p>Another well-paid expert is Ben Thompson, whose paid newsletter <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> brings in over $2,500,000 each year from tech investors and entrepreneurs who pay for a subscription. (<a href="https://twitter.com/AnthPB/status/1230510555343052800">source</a>)</p>



<p>The headcount for his multi-million-dollar-per-year business?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Himself and a personal assistant.</p>



<p>Pure madness.</p>



<p>Here’s the rough playbook:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This is the age of one-person media companies.</p><p>Here’s the business model:</p><p>• Build an email list.<br>• Grow your list with free content.<br>• Monetize with a subscription.<br>• Fans pay for podcasts, ask-me-anything episodes, and behind-the-scenes videos.</p><p>Small teams. Big margins.</p></div>— ᴅᴀᴠɪᴅ ᴘᴇʀᴇʟʟ ✌ (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1249806519052283904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The internet gives you an unprecedented opportunity to turn your knowledge into information products that you can sell to nearly any company or person on Earth who needs it.</p>



<h3>4. The swiss army knife approach</h3>



<p>In reality, many one-person media companies use a combination of business models.</p>



<p>Despite shunning advertising, James Clear embeds affiliate links for any books he recommends. He also sells an online course about habits.</p>



<p>But therein lies the beauty of the one-person media company…</p>



<p><strong>There are </strong><a href="https://trends.vc/trends-0011-paid-newsletters"><strong>tons of creative ways</strong></a><strong> to turn your ideas into money. </strong>You can use whichever ones make the most sense for your particular goal or situation.</p>



<h2 id="pour-gasoline-on-your-career">2. Pour gasoline on your career</h2>



<p>Maybe you don’t want to quit your job to start podcasting, blogging, or recording videos for 40 hours each week.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there’s a much more practical reason why some of us might want to start sharing our ideas online (and you can do it in your spare time):</p>

<p><span>

27 Feb 2020

</span></p><p>In 2018, I wrote an article “Writing an efficient Vulkan renderer” for GPU Zen 2 book, which was published in 2019. In this article I tried to aggregate as much information about Vulkan performance as I could - instead of trying to focus on one particular aspect or application, this is trying to cover a wide range of topics, give readers an understanding of the behavior of different APIs on real hardware and provide a range of options for each problem that needs to be solved.</p>

<p>At the time of publishing this article, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GPU-Zen-Advanced-Rendering-Techniques-ebook/dp/B07SYP7P6B">Kindle edition of the book</a> is available for $2.99 on Amazon - that’s cheaper than a cup of coffee and it’s definitely worth your time and money. It contains many great articles about rendering effects and design.</p>

<p>This, however, is the full, free of charge copy of the article - hopefully it will help graphics programmers to understand and use Vulkan to the full of its ability. The article has been lightly edited to mention Vulkan 1.1/1.2 promotions where applicable - fortunately, not much has changed in the last two years for Vulkan performance, so the content should still be mostly accurate.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Vulkan is a new explicit cross-platform graphics API. It introduces many new concepts that may be unfamiliar to even seasoned graphics programmers. The key goal of Vulkan is performance – however, attaining good performance requires in-depth knowledge about these concepts and how to apply them efficiently, as well as how particular driver implementations implement these. This article will explore topics such as memory allocation, descriptor set management, command buffer recording, pipeline barriers, render passes and discuss ways to optimize CPU and GPU performance of production desktop/mobile Vulkan renderers today as well as look at what a future looking Vulkan renderer could do differently.</p>

<p>Modern renderers are becoming increasingly complex and must support many different graphics APIs with varying levels of hardware abstraction and disjoint sets of concepts. This sometimes makes it challenging to support all platforms at the same level of efficiency. Fortunately, for most tasks Vulkan provides multiple options that can be as simple as reimplementing concepts from other APIs with higher efficiency due to targeting the code specifically towards the renderer needs, and as hard as redesigning large systems to make them optimal for Vulkan. We will try to cover both extremes when applicable – ultimately, this is a tradeoff between maximum efficiency on Vulkan-capable systems and implementation and maintenance costs that every engine needs to carefully pick. Additionally, efficiency is often application-dependent – the guidance in this article is generic and ultimately best performance is achieved by profiling the target application on a target platform and making an informed implementation decision based on the results.</p>

<p>This article assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of Vulkan API, and would like to understand them better and/or learn how to use the API efficiently.</p>



<p>Memory management remains an exceedingly complex topic, and in Vulkan it gets even more so due to the diversity of heap configurations on different hardware. Earlier APIs adopted a resource-centric concept – the programmer doesn’t have a concept of graphics memory, only that of a graphics resource, and different drivers are free to manage the resource memory based on API usage flags and a set of heuristics. Vulkan, however, forces to think about memory management up front, as you must manually allocate memory to create resources.</p>

<p>A perfectly reasonable first step is to integrate <code>VulkanMemoryAllocator</code> (henceforth abbreviated as VMA), which is an open-source library developed by AMD that solves some memory management details for you by providing a general purpose resource allocator on top of Vulkan functions. Even if you do use that library, there are still multiple performance considerations that apply; the rest of this section will go over memory caveats without assuming you use VMA; all of the guidance applies equally to VMA.</p>

<h2 id="memory-heap-selection">Memory heap selection</h2>

<p>When creating a resource in Vulkan, you have to choose a heap to allocate memory from. Vulkan device exposes a set of memory types where each memory type has flags that define the behavior of that memory, and a heap index that defines the available size.</p>

<p>Most Vulkan implementations expose two or three of the following flag combinations<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> – this is generally referring to GPU memory that is not directly visible from CPU; it’s fastest to access from the GPU and this is the memory you should be using to store all render targets, GPU-only resources such as buffers for compute, and also all static resources such as textures and geometry buffers.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> – on AMD hardware, this memory type refers to up to 256 MB of video memory that the CPU can write to directly, and is perfect for allocating reasonable amounts of data that is written by CPU every frame, such as uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT</code><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>  – this is referring to CPU memory that is directly visible from GPU; reads from this memory go over PCI-express bus. In absence of the previous memory type, this generally speaking should be the choice for uniform buffers or dynamic vertex/index buffers, and also should be used to store staging buffers that are used to populate static resources allocated with <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> with data.</li>
  <li><code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT</code> – this is referring to GPU memory that might never need to be allocated for render targets on tiled architectures. It is recommended to use lazily allocated memory to save physical memory for large render targets that are never stored to, such as MSAA images or depth images.
On integrated GPUs, there is no distinction between GPU and CPU memory – these devices generally expose <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> that you can allocate all static resources through as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>When dealing with dynamic resources, in general allocating in non-device-local host-visible memory works well – it simplifies the application management and is efficient due to GPU-side caching of read-only data. For resources that have a high degree of random access though, like dynamic textures, it’s better to allocate them in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code> and upload data using staging buffers allocated in <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory – similarly to how you would handle static textures. In some cases you might need to do this for buffers as well – while uniform buffers typically don’t suffer from this, in some applications using large storage buffers with highly random access patterns will generate too many PCIe transactions unless you copy the buffers to GPU first; additionally, host memory does have higher access latency from the GPU side that can impact performance for many small draw calls.</p>

<p>When allocating resources from <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT</code>, in case of VRAM oversubscription you can run out of memory; in this case you should fall back to allocating the resources in non-device-local <code>VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT</code> memory. Naturally you should make sure that large frequently used resources such as render targets are allocated first. There are other things you can do in an event of an oversubscription, such as migrating resources from GPU memory to CPU memory for less frequently used resources – this is outside of the scope of this article; additionally, on some operating systems like Windows 10 correct handling of oversubscription requires APIs that are not currently available in Vulkan.</p>

<h2 id="memory-suballocation">Memory suballocation</h2>

<p>Unlike some other APIs that allow an option to perform one memory allocation per resource, in Vulkan this is impractical for large applications – drivers are only required to support up to 4096 individual allocations. In addition to the total number being limited, allocations can be slow to perform, may waste memory due to assuming worst case possible alignment requirements, and also require extra overhead during command buffer submission to ensure memory residency. Because of this, suballocation is necessary. A typical pattern of working with Vulkan involves performing large (e.g. 16 MB – 256 MB depending on how dynamic the memory requirements are) allocations using <code>vkAllocateMemory</code>, and performing suballocation of objects within this memory, effectively managing it yourself. Critically, the application needs to handle alignment of memory requests correctly, as well as <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> limit that restricts valid configurations of buffers and images.</p>

<p>Briefly, <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> restricts the relative placement of buffer and image resources in the same allocation, requiring additional padding between individual allocations. There are several ways to handle this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always over-align image resources (as they typically have larger alignment to begin with) by bufferImageGranularity, essentially using a maximum of required alignment and <code>bufferImageGranularity</code> for address and size alignment.</li>
  <li>Track resource type for each allocation, and have the allocator add the requisite padding only if the previous or following resource is of a different type. This requires a somewhat more complex allocation algorithm.</li>
  <li>Allocate images and buffers in separate Vulkan allocations, thus sidestepping the entire problem. This reduces internal fragmentation due to smaller alignment padding but can waste more memory if the backing allocations are too big (e.g. 256 MB).</li>
</ul>

<p>On many GPUs the required alignment for image resources is substantially bigger than it is for buffers which makes the last option attractive – in addition to reducing waste due to lack of extra …</p></div></div>

<p>Lately I’ve been slowly reading “Graffiti Kings: New York Transit Art of the 1970s” by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Stewart_(artist)">Jack Stewart</a>. I’m reading it because I’ve always been a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art">pop art</a>, and as I’ve started to understand more about its context during its period, I also want to understand graffiti and street art better.</p>
<p>For me this is personally linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demo- and introscene</a>, which, as far as I’m concerned is art, and I think its context links pretty well into current digital art and scarcity which is now possible with blockchains, explored by, among others, <a href="https://async.art/">async art</a> and <a href="https://superrare.co/">SuperRare</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve dived into and built a better understanding of this type of art, you begin noticing the details that make it unique. You begin developing a vocabulary for describing it, and you begin to understanding what makes it good or bad, what distinguishes it and its style.</p>
<p>It is like this with programming languages as well. Having been a developer for more or less 20 years, you begin noticing these details. What, to the untrained eye, is just some complex text in “notepad,” becomes beautiful patterns.</p>
<p>Programming is often described as both an art form and a science. </p>
<p>There’s certainly a science to the best practice usage of patterns, which help developers become more efficient and less error prone, by reconciling what they should be doing, under certain conditions.</p>
<p>But this is not the patterns I mention. Instead it is the beauty of a structure more generic and succinct. For me, a few years back, after getting a bit lost in the industrial complex of your usual language selection, I was revitalized by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. As a lisp, it was different, something new, and something which allowed me to rediscover why I originally fell in love with programming. It made me a better developer, because it moved me away from the mass produced “art” of your standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">ALGOL</a>, and towards a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>Having spend some time with Clojure, I feel I can now look back and fundamentally appreciate its beauty. I can see the art in its patterns, I can feel the quality of its meaning. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html">I’ve been enlightened</a>. It doesn’t mean I’m capable of creating a perfectly minimal and generalized lisp structure, but maybe I’m able to spot one when I see it.</p>
<p>With this chance to appreciate this level of beauty within a few lines of text, maybe it also makes me an overall better critic in the more mainstream domain of programming languages.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve fairly recently become a big fan of <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>, simply because it allows me to often describe with similar levels of succinctness, what I want to code, while it at the same time is an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism">practical</a> and forgiving language. It’s a good approximation for both worlds. It’s moving us forward, giving us better tools.</p>
<p>That is a form of beauty which is slightly different than the lisp, but still high quality programming language art as far as I’m concerned. It gives me the same fundamental good feeling about what we’re trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>Sure, it doesn’t have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a> or the immutable persistent data structures by default. But how could it have those things while being practical?</p>
<p>If we want to bring the general understanding of programming languages, from the point of view of it as an art form, forward, we need to make it immediately practical. It can’t be just another hack hobby project, but something with underlying knowledge guiding its design and intent.</p>
<p>It needs to bring this beauty while at the same time solve those everyday mundane programming tasks served up by the industrial complex of generic software development. Only then can the general understanding of programming as an art form gain a broader platform.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h3>Contributing to the Laravel ecosystem</h3><p>This morning I discovered a useful <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laravel package</a> for generating download links for files, that has some useful features, like expiry time, restricted IP addresses.</p><p>One thing was missing: assigning the DownloadLink for a specific user, so for example when somebody purchases a digital product we can generate a DownloadLink that will only allow him to download the file, and nobody else.</p><p>So I thought this is a good opportunity to contribute to the Laravel ecosystem 💡. I went ahead and <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop/laravel-download-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked the repo</a>, added the functionality to assign a DownloadLink to a user, &amp; submitted a <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pull-request</a> (PR) to the owner of the repo, with a detailed explanation what I'm doing.</p><p>The owner of the repo was very fast, and within an hour already added some more features (assigning DownloadLinks to a list of users) and added tests. This is unlike some <a href="https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/pull/141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">other PRs</a> I opened, that are currently waiting for months...</p><h3>Tehran, Iran</h3><p>Some time later I checked back on the PR, and I was surprised to see that it has been closed, and not merged 😕. I opened it up, and this is what greeted me:</p><blockquote>Hi, Thanks for your great idea. I'm SO SORRY to tell you that I cannot merge this PR. There is a law in my country that we MUST NOT have any relationship with people from Israel or the Israel government. I hope you understand this, and again thanks for your time.</blockquote><p>Turns out he's from Tehran, Iran; and he saw on my <a href="https://github.com/Yiddishe-Kop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a> that I'm from Jerusalem, Israel.</p><p>I was very surprised and also hurt. This is the first time I experienced the conflict between Israel &amp; Iran first hand. I also never thought that Iran would have has such laws.</p><p>But hey, maybe I'm a Palestinian living in Jerusalem? Or does Iranian law not differentiate?! 🙃 <em>[...aaahhh, my profile name is</em>  <strong>yiddishe-kop</strong> <em>😉]</em></p><p>I thought for a moment how to respond, and this is how I replied:</p><blockquote>That's very sad, @armancodes. I hope one day your country removes this restriction, just like my country has never put such restrictions. However I'm sure that your governments restrictions don't represent your views 🤷‍♂️ . Good luck anyway! 😃</blockquote><p>A friend later suggested that I should've responded like so 😅:</p><blockquote>Hi, I'm from the IRGC secret intelligence <em>🕵️‍♂️</em>, we just wanted to test your loyalty to the regime, therefore we create fake accounts. You can merge the PR without any problem</blockquote><p>💡 🙃</p><h3>OpenSource, Earth</h3><p>Meanwhile, a few days later somebody posted this on <a href="https://insin.github.io/react-hn/#/story/24364793?_k=l43je0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>, and it was trending on the top of the list. People were discussing if the Iranian violated GitHub's TOS, and how an Iranian is using GitHub when Iran is currently under US sanctions.</p><p>Another interesting development - <a href="https://github.com/behdad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Behdad Esfahbod</a>, an Iranian/Canadian open-source programmer, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Behdad_Esfahbod" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">well known</a> for his very large open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HarfBuzz</a>, (who recently <a href="https://medium.com/@behdadesfahbod/if-you-read-one-thing-from-me-please-be-this-2262ec7b8af2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had an ordeal</a> with the IRGC) <a href="https://github.com/armancodes/laravel-download-link/pull/9#issuecomment-686413931" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commented on the repo</a>: <strong>Just merge it.</strong> Soon after that, the PR was suddenly locked for conversation by the owner.</p><h3>What's with the code?</h3><p>I'll probably just have to continue working on my fork of the repo for my own needs, but without being able to collaborate together, it is a loss for the open source community.</p><p>Let's hope that the Iranian people will be freed from their ayatollahs, and be able to collaborate with whoever they want.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5236373f3d12253d20393d217f3d3926337c313d3f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Recently I realised that, as part of his 8086 reverse-engineering series, Ken Shirriff had posted online a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/06/a-look-at-die-of-8086-processor.html">high resolution photograph of the 8086 die with the metal layer removed</a>. This was something I have been looking for for some time, in order to extract and disassemble the 8086 microcode. I had previously found very high resolution photos of the die with the metal layer intact, but only half of the bits of the microcode ROM were readable. Ken also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/kenshirriff/status/1278713580351700993">high resolution photograph of the microcode ROM of the 8088</a>, which is very similar but not identical. I was very curious to know what the differences were.</p>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitract">bitract</a> to extract the bits from the two main microcode ROMs, and also from the translation ROM which maps opcode bit patterns onto positions within the main microcode ROM.</p>



<p>The microcode is partially documented in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US4363091">US patent 4363091</a>. In particular, that patent has source listings for several microcode routines. Within these, there are certain patterns of parts of instructions which I was able to find in the ROM dump. This allowed me to figure out how the bit patterns in the ROM correspond to the operands and opcodes of the microcode instruction set, in a manner similar to cracking a monoalphabetic substitution cipher. My resulting disassembly of the microcode ROM can be found <a href="https://www.reenigne.org/misc/8086_microcode.zip">here</a> and the code for my disassembler is <a href="https://github.com/reenigne/reenigne/blob/master/8088/8086_microcode">on github</a>.</p>



<p>This disassembly has answered many questions I had about the 8088 and 8086. The remainder of this post contains the answers to these questions and other interesting things I found in the microcode.</p>



<p><strong>What are the microcode differences between the 8086 and the 8088?</strong></p>



<p>The differences are in the interrupt handling code. I think it comes down to fact that the 8086 does two special bus accesses to acknowledge an interrupt (one to tell the PIC that it is ready to service the interrupt, the second to fetch the interrupt number for the IRQ that needs to be serviced). These are word-sized accesses for some reason, so the 8088 would break them into four accesses instead of two. This would confuse the PIC, so the 8088 does a single access instead and relies on the BIU to split the access into two. The other changes seem to be fallout related to that.</p>



<p><strong>Are the microcode listings in the US4363091 accurate?</strong></p>



<p>Mostly. There are differences, however (which added some complexity to the deciphering process). The differences are in the string instructions. For example, the "STS" (STOSB/STOSW) instruction in the patent is:</p>



<pre>CR  S      D      Type  a     b     F
-------------------------------------
0   IK     IND    7     F1    1
1   (M)    OPR    6     w     DA,BL
2   IND    IK     0     F1    0
3                 4     none  RNI</pre>



<p>In the actual CPU, this has become:</p>



<pre>0   IK    -&gt; IND       7   F1    RPTS
1   M     -&gt; OPR       6   w     DA,BL
2   IND   -&gt; IK        0   NF1      5
3   SIGMA -&gt; tmpc      5   INT   RPTI
4   tmpc  -&gt; BC        0   NZ       1
5                      4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>The arrow isn't a difference - I just put that in my disassembly to emphasize the direction of data movement in the "move" part of the microcode instructions. Likewise, the "F1 1" in the patent listing is the same as the "F1 RPTS" in my disassembly - I have replaced subroutine numbers with names to make it easier to read.</p>



<p>The version in the patent does a check for pending interrupts in the "RPTS" routine, before it processes any iterations of the string. This means that if there is a continuous "storm" of interrupts, the string instruction will make no progress. The version in the CPU corrects this, and checks for interrupts on line 3, after it has done the store, allowing it to progress. This was probably not a situation that was expected to occur in normal operation (in fact, I seem to recall crashing my 8088 and 8086 machines by having interrupts happen too rapidly to be serviced). The change was most likely done to accommodate debugging with the trap flag (which essentially means that there is always an interrupt pending when the trap flag is set). Without this change, code that used the repeated string instructions would not have progressed under the debugger.</p>



<p><strong>How many different instructions does the 8086 have, according to the microcode? What are they?</strong></p>



<p>The CPU has 60 instructions, and they're in a fairly logical sort of order:</p>



<p>(Numbers are: number of opcodes handled, size of top-level microcode routine.)</p>

INT ib         1  2
INTO           1  4
INT 3          1  3</pre>



<p>The discontinuous instructions were most likely broken up because they had bug fixes making them too long for their original slots. Similarly "POP rmw" appears to have been shortened by at least 3 instructions as there is a gap after it. Moving code around after it's been written (and updating all the far jump/call locations) would probably have been tricky.</p>



<p><strong>Which instructions, if any, are not handled by the microcode?</strong></p>



<p>There is no microcode for the segment override prefixes (CS:, SS:, DS: and ES:). Nor for the other prefixes (REP, REPNE and LOCK), nor the instructions CLC, STC, CLI, STI, CLD, STD, CMC, and HLT. The "group" opcodes 0xf6, 0xf7, 0xfe and 0xff do not have top level microcode instructions. So none of the instructions with 0xf in the high nybble of the opcode are initially handled by the microcode. Most of these instruction are very simple and probably better done by random logic. HLT is a little surprising - I really thought I'd find a microcode loop for that one since it only seems to check for interrupts every other cycle.</p>



<p>The group instructions are decoded slightly differently but the microcode routines handling them break down as follows:</p>



<pre>INC/DEC rm        3
PUSH rm           4
NOT rm            3
NEG rm            3
CALL FAR rm       8
CALL rm           8
TEST rm,i         4
JMP rm            2
JMP FAR rm        4
IMUL/MUL rmb      8
IMUL/MUL rmw      8
IDIV/DIV rmb      8
IDIV/DIV rmw      8</pre>



<p>Then there are various subroutines and tail calls (listed in translation.txt). Highlights:</p>



<ul><li>interrupt handling (16 microinstructions)</li><li>sign handling for multiply and divide, flags for multiply (32)</li><li>effective address computation (16)</li><li>reset routine (sets CS=0xffff, DS=ES=SS=FLAGS=PC=0) (6)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Does the microcode contain any "junk code" that doesn't do anything?</strong></p>



<p>It seems to! While most of the unused parts of the ROM (64 instructions) are filled with zeroes, there are a few parts which aren't. The following instructions appear right at the end of the ROM:</p>



<pre>A     -&gt; tmpa      5   INT   FARCALL2      011100011.0110
[  5] -&gt; [ a]      5   UNC   INTR     F    011100011.0111</pre>



<p>There doesn't appear to be any way for execution to reach these instructions. This code saves AL to tmpa (which doesn't appear to then be used at all) and then does either an interrupt or (if an interrupt is pending) a far call. In the interrupt case it also does a move between a source and a destination that aren't used anywhere else (and hence I have no idea what they are). This makes me wonder if there was at one point a plan for something like an "INT AL" instruction. With the x86 instruction set we ended up with, such a thing has to be done using self-modifying code, a table of INT instructions, or faking the operation of INT in software).</p>



<p>The following code is also inaccessible and appears to do something with the low byte of the last offset read from or written to, and the carry flag:</p>



<pre>IND   -&gt; tmpaL     1   LRCY  tmpc     F      01010?10?.1010</pre>



<p>No idea what that could be for - nothing else in the microcode treats the IND register as two separate bytes.</p>



<p><strong>Are there are any parts of the microcode that are still not understood?</strong></p>



<p>When the WAIT instruction finishes in the non-interrupt case (i.e. by the -TEST pin going active to signal that the 8087 has completed an instruction) the microcode sequence finishes using this sequence:</p>



<pre>                   4   [ 1]  none
                   4   none  RNI</pre>



<p>I don't know what the "[ 1]" does - it isn't used anywhere else.</p>



<p>There is also a bit (shown as "Q" in the listings) which does not have an obvious function for "type 6" (bus IO) operations. This Q bit is only set for "W" (write) operations, and is differentiated in the listing by write operations without it being shown in lower case ("w"). There seems to be no pattern as to which writes use this bit. The string move instructions use it, as does the stack push for the flags when an interrupt occurs, and the push of the segment for a far call or interrupt (but not the offset). It would make sense if this bit was used to distinguish between memory and port IO bus accesses, but the CPU seems to have another mechanism for this (most likely the group decode ROM, which I have not decoded as there are …</p></div></div>

<p>Neural language models like BERT, XLNet, and GPT-3 picked up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/artificial-intelligence-aristo-passed-test.html">headline-grabbing</a> steam over the last couple of years. Why is this?</p>
<p>The machine learning algorithms for common NLP tasks like entity recognition and question answering typically require feature vectors as input. Natural language inputs are represented as vectors, and from this point we train models to classify text, cluster documents, answer questions, and the like.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>A considerable amount of research over the past decade has demonstrated the importance of language modeling as a driver for the ultimate quality of the downstream NLP task models.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> The statistical language models of last century like <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-explanation-of-the-bag-of-words-model-b88fc4f4971">bag-of-words</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a> effectively capped the state of the art well below “earth-shattering” for many NLP tasks, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete">AI-hard</a> NLP tasks that captivate us. I remember first playing with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_Fish_(website)#History">Babel Fish</a> machine translation engine in the late 1990s and concluding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a> was a long way away — Babel Fish often felt more like a word-by-word dictionary lookup engine than a language understanding and translation AI.</p>
<p>The aforementioned cap has since lifted (arguably disappeared) for many NLP tasks, and we constantly experience the benefits firsthand when we search the web or talk to Alexa. NLP advancements exploded in 2018 as a new class of language models arrived: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMo</a> based on LSTMs, followed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> based on the transformer architecture.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> The New Idea of these language models is in their dependency on word context; whereas previous non-contextual word embeddings like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf">word2vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> encode a given word into exactly one vector, the Sesame Street models are designed to capture language nuance in ways that non-contextual word embeddings can’t by definition. (Can you spot an example in this sentence that would be problematic for word2vec, or are you seeing spots?)</p>
<h3 id="neural-language-model-training-cost">Neural Language Model Training Cost</h3>
<p>State-of-the-art language models can be <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08900.pdf">astronomically expensive</a> to train. Models like BERT and XLNet learn 100s of millions of parameters and the compute cost to train many neural language models from scratch is prohibitive for most organizations. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237">XLNet</a> required training for 5.5 days on 512 TPU v3’s. The cost to replicate this on GCP would be over $500,000.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Language model complexity and training cost is only increasing — OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, introduced in May 2020, learns 175 billion parameters and is estimated to have cost <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/01/ai-machine-learning-openai-gpt-3-size-isnt-everything/">over $12M to train</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/nlp_transfer_learning.png" alt="Transfer Learning in NLP"></p>
<center>An example sequential transfer learning workflow for NLP. Often costly pretraining produces a generally useful language model that is adapted to solve a specific downstream NLP task. Source for model images:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding</a></center>
<p>Thanks to the research community and the organizations backing language model research, high-quality pretrained models are freely available for anyone to use.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Not only are model checkpoints available, but the broader ML library ecosystem makes it straightforward to use these pretrained models in your framework of choice with just a few lines of code. As a result, the aforementioned sequential transfer learning approach to NLP tasks is easy to implement <em>on a reasonable budget</em>. In our case, we trained BERT for SQuAD to produce a model that can extract answers to questions about a given passage. Each experiment required under $20 of compute cost to train on GCP, <em>and</em> we achieve high quality F1 scores in the 87-89% range. For comparison’s sake, human performance is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05250.pdf">86.8%</a>, and state of the art is <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/">93%</a>.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="baseline-single-gpu-training">Baseline Single GPU Training</h3>
<p>Let’s start by training a BERT model for SQuAD on a single GPU. In <a href="https://github.com/determined-ai/determined/tree/master/examples/experimental/trial/bert_squad_pytorch">this PyTorch example</a>, we use Hugging Face’s <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers#run_squadpy-fine-tuning-on-squad-for-question-answering">Transformers</a> library’s pretrained model, featurization and data loading methods, and reference hyperparameters. Training for about 2 epochs on a single GPU yields an F1 score of 88.4% on the validation dataset. Not bad at all… but it took well over 7 hours to train! That’s a <em>long</em> time to wait for results, and this is only one well-trodden benchmark NLP task with fixed hyperparameters. If you or your team need to train on more data, tune hyperparameters, train models for other NLP tasks, or develop and debug models for custom downstream tasks, spending a day or longer to train each model would grind progress to a crawl.</p>
<h3 id="dividing-and-conquering">Dividing and Conquering</h3>
<p>In the remainder of this post, we show how to use <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/distributed-training.html">Determined’s distributed training features</a> to perform the same training task about <strong>14 times faster</strong>, while achieving the same model accuracy! In the process, we’ll surface the key factors affecting scaling performance and offer practical guidance for effective distributed training.</p>
<p>Thanks to Determined’s <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/standardized-models-with-determined/">standardized model paradigm</a>, <em>training a model on multiple GPUs requires no code changes</em>. Every result that follows, whether training with 2 GPUs on a single machine or 16 GPUs across multiple machines, only required a configuration change.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can train the same model above in a lunch break rather than a full workday, by utilizing distributed training on Determined. In this blog, we focus on optimizing the training loop. In part 2, we will focus on other components of the training workflow that impact overall runtime, namely data loading and validation. To that end, the following wall clock times are net of data loading and validation.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="initial-results">Initial Results</h3>
<p>The following graph and table show wall clock training time as we scale from 1 to 8 NVIDIA K80 GPUs,<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> all on a single machine on GCP. For these experiments, we fixed both the per-GPU batch size and the total number of epochs to train.</p>
<p><img src="https://determined.ai/assets/images/posts/dtrain_graph.png" alt="Training Time vs. GPUs"></p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a decent initial result — we aren’t achieving linear scaling, but our scaling efficiency remains above 80%, and also we managed to get wall clock training time for the BERT SQuAD model down to an hour. We achieved an F1 score of 87-88% on the validation dataset for all four experiments.</p>
<h3 id="doing-better-gradient-aggregation-and-radam">Doing Better: Gradient Aggregation and RAdam</h3>
<p>In our results above, there is a clear downward trend in scaling efficiency as we increase the degree of training parallelism. What’s going on there? Maybe we can live with the results at this scale, but what if we had a much heavier-weight training workload that we wanted to distribute across 64 GPUs? The trend is not playing in our favor.</p>
<p>A natural theory for what might be happening is that training is communication-bound. To distribute training over 8 GPUs, Determined divides the training dataset into 8 shards, independently trains 8 models (one per GPU) for a minibatch, and then aggregates and communicates gradient updates so that all 8 copies of the model have the same weights. Then we repeat this process of forward &amp; backward pass followed by gradient aggregation, for every batch.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> As we discuss in our blog <a href="https://determined.ai/blog/distributed-deep-learning-that-actually-works/">here</a> and in our product documentation <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/topic-guides/effective-distributed-training.html#effective-distributed-training">here</a>, communication-reducing techniques like large batch training can help to reduce wall clock training time. Such techniques are particularly promising when GPUs are connected via PCI-E as opposed to higher-bandwidth (yet more expensive) NVLink.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Let’s see if this theory plays out for our model. With Determined, you can adjust your per-slot batch size with a configuration change, though bear in mind that even small increases can quickly exhaust GPU memory because the intermediate state needed for the forward and backward pass scale with the size of the model and are <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-break-gpu-memory-boundaries-even-with-large-batch-sizes-7a9c27a400ce">linearly dependent</a> on the batch size. Instead, we kept GPU memory requirements moderate in order to run on lower cost NVIDIA K80s. We accomplished this by leveraging a Determined distributed training optimization that reduces both inter-GPU communication and per-GPU memory requirements. This <a href="https://docs.determined.ai/latest/reference/experiment-config.html#optimizations">aggregation frequency</a> configuration option specifies the number of forward and backward passes to perform before communicating gradient updates across GPUs. In the following table, we see that increasing our aggregation frequency definitely helps runtime:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>
<th>Validation F1</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>14</td>
<td>87.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td>
<td>31</td>
<td>52.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That’s great — if we can cut 31 minutes off of training time, our per-GPU scaling efficiency goes from 0.93 to a perfect 1. I left something out though — for the 3 rows above, our validation dataset F1 scores are 87.3%, 85%, and (gulp) 52.1%, respectively.</p>
<p>So close, and yet so far. What is happening here? Large batch stochastic gradient descent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf">doesn’t always “just work”</a>; in particular, it’s difficult to find the learning rate sweet spot in this setting. Sometimes, the Linear Scaling Rule works, where if we multiple the batch size by <em>k</em>, we also multiply the (previously tuned) learning rate by <em>k</em>. In our case, using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html#adamw-pytorch">AdamW</a> optimizer, linear scaling did not help at all; in fact, our F1 scores were even worse when applying the Linear Scaling Rule. Learning rate warmup strategies can also help, where smaller learning rates are used early in large-batch training. In our experience, though, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265v1">RAdam</a> optimizer is a better bet that performs robustly for large batch training without the need for extensive learning rate tuning. When we swap in <a href="https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/RAdam/tree/master/radam">this RAdam implementation</a>, our results look much better:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aggregation Frequency</th>
<th>Wall Clock Time Savings (minutes)</th>

		<p>You probably know me. Or someone like me. The guy who always raises his hand in class or who has a question or comment regarding whatever idea is being discussed. You might find people like me annoying. I’ve never understood why there seems to be so few of us though. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve wanted to question things; to figure out <em>why</em> or <em>how</em>. Unfortunately, it seems most people don’t. Or rather, it seems as though people are afraid of asking questions. Whether it is from fear of showing that they don’t know or from not wanting to take up other people’s time or something else entirely, I’ve never been able to understand. I do know, however, that it disturbs me.</p>

<p>There are many quotes on questions, like “better to ask and be thought a fool for five minutes than to remain a fool forever” and the likes, but to me, there is something deeper than that. Asking questions often reveals a lot more information than just the answer to the question, almost regardless of the situation. At university, questions can not only reveal errors in the material, but they can spawn discussions on aspects of the topic that suddenly makes it so much clearer why things have to be the way they are. If you strive to understand, questions tend to give a deeper understanding of what’s going on than trying to fill the gaps yourself.</p>

<p>Questions are important in the professional world as well, whether to make clients think properly through the problem they are presenting you with so you don’t go solving the wrong problem or to your peers to come up with the best solution to a problem. I’ve lost count of the number of times a solution has been accepted simply because no-one asked questions at the time it was proposed, only for it to later turn out that it was a terrible solution, and several people in the group saw that it was. This is not because the person with the original idea was an idiot, but rather because there was no feedback process. Without questions, without questioning, ideas are never refined. They need critique and thought, things that are incurred by asking questions.</p>

<p>Indeed, even in personal relationships, questions are important. Asking others questions about themselves serves both to show them that you care, but also for you to learn more about that person. And not only whatever the answer to the question is; you often learn a great deal more about a person simply from digging a little bit. One question often turns into a deeper conversation. Even asking others questions about yourself can be hugely rewarding; what better way of getting a better understanding of how people perceive you than to ask? Many might find this difficult because they are afraid of what they might learn, but if you truly want to improve yourself as a person, then asking is the best way of finding out where you should start.</p>

<p>So, given all the benefits asking questions have, why are there so few people like me? Why is it that there’s “that one person always raising his hand” or that “that one person always questioning people’s ideas”? Why is it that during lectures, I’m the only one who asks questions nearly every time? Why is it that such a low fraction of people account for such a large fraction of the questions? I refuse to believe that other people aren’t curious or have doubts about things. My deepest fear is that people just don’t care. That they don’t care how a particular project turns out or whether they get a complete understanding of whatever is being taught in a lecture. They just want to get by. This is a terrible, terrible attitude, one that inhibits innovation and exploration. Come on people, raise your hands and speak your mind! Develop. Learn. Explore. Question. Care! Or go do something else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>(back-ported from Medium - May 19, 2019)</p>

<p>I used to get rather upset about how I was born so late into the game of computer science. I mean look at it, all the coolest stuff that involves computer science fundamentals we learned in school have all been invented — programming languages, operating systems, data structures and algorithms, storage systems, cryptography, computer graphics, world wide web, etc. Our day-to-day job involves taking these wonderful tools built by other brilliant people and then stitching them together with if/else statements. Everything is becoming a blackbox and these boxes just keep on getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>binaries → high level languages &amp; frameworks</li>
<li>formal proof → chaos monkey</li>
<li>on-prem → cloud</li>
<li>decision trees → neural networks</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of how high the piles of abstraction are, there is simply no way to understand everything. So we have no choice but to use the lazy evaluation approach — where we trust the systems and tools to work, and only when it doesn’t will we then start digging into the layers of abstraction in an attempt to understand and fix the problem. If we are lucky, we can dig all the way to the root of the problem. Other times it is a true blackbox (be it due to a mental constraint, like neural networks, where our brain simply doesn’t have that kind of capability to process all the information; or be it due to a physical constraint, like cloud products, where the source code is locked away as trade secrets), where all we could do is trial and error — we form an arbitrary hypothesis, run it against the box, and check its output to see if matches the hypothesis. And perhaps with this newly concluded confirmation bias we fixed the problem, but we still don’t fully understand the box so we are left with a hint of sadness. Theoretically we could build everything from scratch, but working in the industry means productivity is king; we certainly won’t be at our jobs for long if we insisted on doing that.</p>

<p>It took my ego a while to accept this reality. But once I did, I realized: how close-minded of me to think that all the coolest things have been invented! The point of invention is that it does not exist yet. So that assumption all the coolest things have been invented is absurd (and cocky). Instead, the area for innovations simply moved up in the abstraction layer, while I grudgingly stayed below. I learned to marvel at the existing robustness and intricacy of the systems and tools we already have, and at the same time try to take learnings from it in attempt to identify gaps and improve the ecosystem further.</p>

<p>Thinking on a higher level today, there are so many potential areas for improvements off the top of my head (from the perspective of an infrastructure engineer, so these ideas are rather limited in scope):</p>

<ul>
<li>Why are the most popular programming languages still designed for a single machine and have to rely on libraries built on top of application protocols to communicate between machines? I could imagine a rise of distributed + declarative programming languages in the near future that abstract all that away.</li>
<li>Why are we still stuck on application protocols like HTTP/FTP/etc. anyways? I could imagine higher level of protocols that communicate more with less code/data.</li>
<li>Why are we replicating data on so many heterogenous storage systems in order to optimize for different use patterns. I can imagine a one-size-fits-many database in the future which stores the data once but leverage machine learning to optimize for different usage patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I have come to accept my fate as a millennial software engineer that stands on the shoulder of giants and stitches their work together, because I realized that the giants before us were no different — they were also building abstraction layers on top of the work known before them. There is always room for innovation, as long as one sets the mind to it. This is what I love about this field of work — formulating ideas and then making them concrete via code.</p>

However, when we look at our <em>repertoire of functions</em>, we see that something else is missing, namely:</p><blockquote><p>What about the functions constructed via <strong>exponentiation</strong>?</p></blockquote><p>Here, prompted by an <em>unusual</em> sense of urgency, we proceed to toy around with the idea of <em>derivative of a power</em>, subsequently ending up developing a rule precisely for that purpose. The name? <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> of course! Now, we bet that you haven’t seen this one yet — at least not in a standard calculus textbook or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus?t=table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> anyway!</p><h2 id="theory"><span id="Exponent_Rule_for_Derivative_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Exponent Rule for Derivative — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p>Given a <strong>base function</strong>&nbsp;$f$ and an <strong>exponent function</strong> $g$ — both defined on an interval $I$ — one&nbsp;can construct&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>power function</strong>&nbsp;$f^g$ (i.e., $f$ raised to $g$),&nbsp;which is defined as long as&nbsp;$f(x)&gt;0$ on $I$ (<a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/#terms">why?</a>). In which&nbsp;case, the <a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/"><strong>properties of logarithm</strong></a> warrant that:</p><p>\begin{align*} f(x)^{g(x)} &amp; = e^{\ln \left[ f(x)^{g(x)} \right] } = e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \end{align*}</p><p>which suggests that $\displaystyle&nbsp;e^{g(x) \ln f(x)}$ and $\displaystyle f(x)^{g(x)}$ can be used interchangeably on $I$.</p><p>More importantly though, in the case where $f$ and $g$ are <em>both differentiable</em> on $I$, using&nbsp;a combination of <strong>Chain Rule</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Product Rule</strong>, we get that:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left(&nbsp;f(x)^{g(x)} \right)’ &amp; = \left(&nbsp;e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \right)’ \\ &amp; = e^{g(x) \ln f(x)} \, [g(x) \ln f(x)]’ \\ &amp; = f(x)^{g(x)} \left[ g'(x) \ln f(x) +&nbsp;f'(x) \frac{ g(x)}{f(x)} \right] \end{align*}</p><p>Too much $f$ and $g$? No&nbsp;worry. All we have shown is that the derivative of $f^g$ can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$&nbsp;— and hence the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> for derivatives!</p><div><p>Theorem — The Exponent Rule for Derivative</p><div><p>Given a <strong>base</strong> function $f$ and an <strong>exponent</strong> function $g$, if:</p><ol><li>The <strong>power function</strong> $f^g$ is <em>well-defined</em> on an interval $I$ (i.e.,$f$ and $g$ both well-defined on $I$, with $f&gt;0$ on $I$)</li><li>Both $f$ and $g$ are <em>differentiable</em> on $I$</li></ol><p>then the function $f^g$ is <em>differentiable</em>&nbsp;on $I$ as well.

With the advent of the Exponent Rule, both of these approaches basically become obsolete — not because they are irrelevant per se, but because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;already been carried out&nbsp;<em>during</em> the derivation of the Exponent Rule.</p><p>In what follows, we lay out&nbsp;7 examples illustrating how the Exponent Rule can be used to&nbsp;<em>streamline</em> the differentiation process for <strong>power functions</strong>, thereby freeing up some of our brainpower and resources&nbsp;to other potentially-more-challenging tasks that are yet to come.</p><h3 id="ex1"><span id="Example_1_%E2%80%94_$%5Cpi%5Ex$"></span><a href="#toc">Example 1 — $\pi^x$</a><span></span></h3><p>With the base function being $\pi$ and the exponent function $x$, the exponential function $\pi^x$ — which is defined on the <em>entire</em> real line&nbsp;— easily satisfies the <em>preconditions</em> laid out by the Exponent Rule. In which case, differentiating it using the Rule yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (\pi^x)’ &amp; = \pi^x \left[ (x)’ \ln \pi + (\pi)’ \frac{x}{\pi} \right] = \pi^x \ln \pi \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which shows that $\pi^x$ differentiates to itself along&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;<em>adjustment factor</em> — a typical behavior among the&nbsp;exponential functions.</p><p>Now, is that a&nbsp;<em>heavy-handed</em> differentiation approach to a&nbsp;particularly-simple function? Actually, not really, for as it turns out, the alternative approaches would have been essentially the same&nbsp;— save perhaps a few more extra <em>“patching” steps</em>.</p><p>Finally, to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;our first <em>successful</em> execution of the Exponent Rule, we’ve cooked up the graphs of $\pi^x$ and its derivative here:</p><figure id="attachment_6618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6618"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/pi^x.png" alt="The exponential function pi^x (red) and its derivative (green)" width="1020" height="716" title=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6618">$\pi^x$ in <span>red</span>, and its derivative in <span>green</span>.

However, this is really more of a blessing than a curse, as $\mathbb{R_+}$ happens to be the <em>biggest</em> domain under which both the base and the exponent function are differentiable anyway. In which case, applying the&nbsp;<strong>Exponent Rule</strong> yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (x^{\ln x})’ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \left[ (\ln x)’ (\ln x) + (x)’\frac{\ln x}{x} \right] \\ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \left[ \frac{\ln x}{x} + \frac{\ln x}{x} \right] \\ &amp; = x^{\ln x} \, \frac{2 \ln x}{x} \qquad (x&gt;0) \end{align*}</p><p>which is not too bad as a result.

Time to unleash the&nbsp;e<em>xtravaganza</em>! With the base function $x^2+1$ and the exponent function $\sin x$, the power function $\displaystyle (x^2+1)^{\sin x}$ — which is defined&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em> on&nbsp;$\mathbb{R}$&nbsp;— has the added bonus that both the base and the exponent functions are differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ as well. In which case, a single application of the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong>&nbsp;yields:</p><p>\begin{align*} \left( (x^2+1)^{\sin x}\right)’ &amp; = (x^2+1)^{\sin x} \left[ (\sin x)’ \ln (x^2+1) + (x^2+1)’ \frac{\sin x}{x^2+1} \right] \\ &amp; = (x^2+1)^{\sin x} \left[ \cos x \ln (x^2+1) + \frac{2x \sin x}{x^2+1} \right] \end{align*}</p><p>Interesting!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’d like to announce the public beta of <a href="https://www.cerveau.app/">Cerveau</a><sup><a href="#fn1" name="fnref1">1</a></sup>, a web app for managing plain-text notes from a GitHub repository. Cerveau integrates directly with <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> which supports <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125">Zettelkasten</a>-style note-taking in Markdown. This very site you are reading is managed by Neuron and edited in Cerveau, and its Git repo is essentially <a href="https://github.com/srid/srid.ca">a directory of Markdown files</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.cerveau.app/"><img src="https://www.srid.ca/static/cerveau.svg"></a></p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I created the open-source <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch">scratch my own itch</a>, wherein I wanted to maintain my notes for a lifetime, without being dependent on proprietory formats or systems. I still wasn’t totally satisfied however, because I did not want to give up on the <em>convenience</em> of managing notes from a web app on my mobile phone. I didn’t want to be tied to a desktop text editor. So, the idea behind Cerveau was born - which began to resolve that dissatifaction without compromising on <a href="https://neuron.zettel.page/6f0f0bcc.html">future-proofness</a>.</p><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>All notes are written in Markdown, and stored in a Git repository. Cerveau directly modifies the contents of the repository using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps">GitHub Apps API</a>, while caching the latest revision of the repository on a PostgreSQL database. This allows me to edit my notes from a web browser (as well as from a mobile phone), while keeping the canonical version always on Git all the while allowing edits from elsewhere such as <a href="https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode#neuron-mode">Emacs</a> (i.e., two-way sync).</p><h2 id="technology-used">Technology used</h2><p>Both the backend and frontend components of Cerveau are written in <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2009703.html">Haskell</a></span></span>. Haskell is my programming language of choice, because it gets a lot of things right (see <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Why_Haskell_matters">Why Haskell matters</a>). Software I write in Haskell tends to be reliable; and I can refactor with confidence without being unduly afraid of introducing bugs. This is especially important when dealing with otherwise brittle JavaScript code in frontend code.</p><h3 id="javascript-is-the-new-assembly-language">JavaScript is the new assembly language</h3><p>Cerveau’s frontend too is written in Haskell. Wait, how is that possible? The GHCJS compiler compiles Haskell code to low-level JavaScript for running in the browser. Cerveau uses the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012405.html">Reflex FRP</a></span></span> library, via the excellent <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012403.html">Obelisk</a></span></span> framework, which takes care of all the plumbing required to produce such full-stack Haskell apps, so that I as a developer can focus on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/31rat9/reflex_practical_functional_reactive_programming/">FRP</a> application logic. FRP, and similar models of UI programming, is simpler to write and extend than callback based code. Anybody who writes Elm<sup><a href="#fn2" name="fnref2">2</a></sup> can attest to that; however unlike Elm or PureScript, GHCJS code can be <em>shared</em> with the backend. This is what enables Cerveau to directly reuse much of the <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/b6df4059.html">Neuron</a></span></span> source code, thus enabling neuron’s core features to work directly on the browser–for example, live HTML preview while editing the note.</p><p>The editor widget is based on CodeMirror, via <a href="https://github.com/Atidot/reflex-codemirror">reflex-codemirror</a>.</p><h3 id="real-time-communication-via-websockets">Real-time communication via WebSockets</h3><p>WebSockets, via <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2012401.html">Rhyolite</a></span></span>, is used for real-time communication between the backend and the frontend; if you have two windows open, then updating a note from one window will have the other window automatically update its view without an explicit refresh (this works even if you are viewing a different note that has the modified note in its backlinks).</p><h3 id="nix">Nix</h3><p><span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/2017102.html">Nix</a></span></span> is used for both developent and deployment; the production version in particular is deployed to a <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d19bbb4d33e8">DigitalOcean</a> droplet running <span><span><a href="https://www.srid.ca/c7170724.html">NixOS</a></span></span>. Nix makes reproducible development environments easy and possible. A testament to this is how easy it is to contribute to neuron (see <a href="https://github.com/srid/neuron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a>) - as with one command, <code>nix-shell</code>, you get the full development enviornment including Haskell IDE support starting from a pristine system with nothing but Nix installed.</p><h3 id="full-stack-haskell-from-prototype-to-production">Full-Stack Haskell, from Prototype to Production</h3><p>Much of these technology choices were informed by my working with the folks from <a href="https://obsidian.systems/">Obsidian Systems</a>, whose philosophy is captured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJuXDIUMA0">this talk</a>.</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riJuXDIUMA0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

    					<div>
    					    
        					<p>The effect of Open Sourced Software on the world is undeniable. From Android and Linux, which are used by literal billions of people, to Wordpress, GIMP, VLC, and Firefox, OSS (Open sourced software) is truly utilized by everyone, in nearly every aspect of their daily lives. This doesn’t even include the millions of open sourced softwares embedded in the web for every day use. Yet, the tech industry is still the most prosperous on earth, with Silicon Valley accounting for a higher GDP output than Finland (roughly $275 billion per year), and all tech stocks accounting for roughly 1/5th of the worlds economic output.&nbsp;</p><p>How is it than an industry that drives the entire planets economy can be based off of something free-to-use, and still be valuable? Simple: Everyone in the industry benefits from the common core of open source tech - They utilize this common base to propel their proprietary technology farther than it could have ever gone without the OSS. The sum of all these parts is greater than the whole. They don’t prosper <i>despite</i> the free software, they prosper <i>because</i> of the free software.&nbsp;</p><p>So, why cant Open Source principles be applied to other industries? Why can’t farming equipment have a common core of open sourced hardware for all farmers in all parts of the world to use? Why cant there be open sourced genetics, where GMO foods are cataloged, modified, and shared by farmers, both with CRISPR and with natural methods? What about building materials and designs? Medicines? Economic data? Camera tech?&nbsp;</p><p>The potential in all industries of what is possible when Open Source principles are applied is staggering. Organizations, both public and private, could have a shared design understanding across entire disciplines, making everyones products work better, sharply increasing both competition and performance for consumers, and in turn increase market saturation and profits for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Specialized companies could still stay specialized. If you offer a particular service that utilized ideas you created, you would have no obligation to share those secrets: Instead, you would have the option to base them on a common footprint of ideas shared by industry leaders, non-profit orgs, and failed businesses that have released their own ideas for the common market to use. Their incentive to do this is two-fold: One - if they are an industry leader - is a way to offload old ideas into the market and build pedigree and reputation among the industry - it shows you are not just a leader, but a supporter, of the industry you participate in. Second - if they are a startup - is to prove your capabilities so that prospective buyers, investors, etc can gauge your prowess on the market. Finally, a failed business might want to offload its ideas that have not sold as a gesture of goodwill - this is something we simply don’t do right now, but there’s no reason we couldn’t.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, the benefits of encouraging Open Source principles in new industries is obvious. I predict that if another industry, like farming, decided to adopt this model they would see huge success from its adoption over time. I personally believe that OS principles could become a polestar for economic growth in the future, and would very likely lead to the rapid technological expansion of any given industry once employed. The future quite literally could be now.&nbsp;</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://www.avo.app/blog/announcing-inspector-and-avos-3m-seed-round | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.avo.app/blog/announcing-inspector-and-avos-3m-seed-round">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We started Avo in 2018 because we believe we can change the way organizations use data to make better decisions for their customers. We’ve been blown away by the impact Avo has had on data quality and developer productivity for our customers. From startups to consumer brands like Rappi, Patreon, TripAdvisor, Sotheby’s, and more, it’s been incredible to see our product fundamentally change the way PMs, devs and data scientists collaborate to plan, track and govern their product analytics. Today, we have some exciting news to share about our progress, a new powerful product offering, and where we’re headed next.</p><h3><strong>What is Avo?</strong><br></h3><p>Avo is next-generation analytics governance. We’re changing how product managers, developers, and data scientists plan, track, and govern analytics across organizations. Before Avo, teams were forced to choose between product delivery speed and reliable insights.&nbsp;</p><p>By using Avo, <a href="https://www.avo.app/customers/patreon-case-study">Patreon has reclaimed 9 out of every 10 hours they used to spend implementing or fixing analytics</a>, going from 4 days for every feature release, to 1 hour.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies have never had to understand their customers better or faster. Consumers choose the product with the best experience and companies can’t afford to stall product decisions while waiting days or weeks for answers from a centralized BI team. In truth, the industry gold standard is to decentralize business intelligence completely, so that every team is autonomous in making data-driven decisions quickly. Spotify is just one example of a company working under this org-structure.&nbsp;</p><p>But data is brittle and bad data leads to incorrect assumptions. With everyone making data-driven decisions, it’s critical to govern data quality, iterate quickly on the product and business, and avoid customer churn.&nbsp;</p><p>We solved this problem ourselves at QuizUp, to ensure engineering and product time wasn’t wasted re-implementing analytics every time we shipped to our 100M users. Avo solves this more permanently as a SaaS platform without diverting precious time from the core product or accruing technical debt. The result is that we’re helping organizations grow by removing friction around analytics governance and implementation.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Introducing Inspector</strong><br></h3><p>The first step to better analytics governance is knowing what’s wrong with your data. Typically, getting that understanding has been a company-wide initiative that takes months or years, and requires buy-in and collaboration from the VP Product, Head of Data, and VP Engineering.</p><p>Today we’re excited to announce the <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">Avo Inspector</a>. Avo Inspector plays into our larger vision of empowering self-serve analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspector processes event streams, parses event shapes (no PII data), visualizes the entire current state of tracking for the company, highlights tracking issues such as type mismatches, missing properties, and volume discrepancies. We built Inspector because we had helped our customers do this manually too many times.&nbsp;</p><p>With Inspector, our customers get instant insight into what is wrong with their analytics, so they can prioritize the most important issues to fix, and start cleaning and future proofing their analytics step-by-step.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we’re getting great early feedback. On-demand delivery unicorn Rappi is just one of the customers using Inspector:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“This year we scaled to meet the demand of 100,000 new customers digitizing their deliveries and curbside pickups. The problem with every new software release was that we’d break analytics. It represented 25% of our Jira tickets.” Says Rappi’s Head of Engineering, Damian Sima, “In our first week with the Avo Inspector, we’re already discovering tracking issues like missing properties and type mismatches. Now we know what to fix and can do that with Avo.”</em></p><p>Here’s how Inspector works:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f4fffd07427330a5584cc9a_EP8HHtAWyyYFT40Q93yVn2-4m1ztt0M79hnPQzq2R72DazHV_JHbrq_tN4CeYZ7Grx_ZcS06XO9pUqVFUGXhxrbFh5S56WakXhTgaQ5PzrV9jcYNCiF4u9kJTssTJ5smUWQyDU4N.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Inspect your current tracking automatically</strong></p><p>Install the Inspector SDK to observe a living summary of current tracking across platforms. Inspector doesn’t gather any user data, only event shapes and volumes.</p><p><strong>Analyze tracking issues instantly</strong></p><p>Inspector dashboard highlights your current event tracking issues, so different stakeholders can discuss and prioritize what to fix.</p><p><strong>Prioritize what matters</strong></p><p>The inspector dashboard gives you and your team the overview you need, to prioritize the tracking changes that will have the biggest impact on cleaning up mission-critical metrics so you can make progress quickly.</p><p><strong>Clean, step-by-step</strong></p><p>Use your complete overview of what needs to be fixed across platforms, to fix top priority issues with clear event and property definitions, implemented with type safe analytics.</p><p><strong>Future proof</strong></p><p>Great product analytics help teams make the best decisions to grow their business. Truly useful metrics for today and beyond are transparent — where everyone knows which events can help answer their questions — and reliable, consistent data, easy to evolve and implement as the product grows.</p><p>If you’re curious about the infrastructure and behind the scenes (as you should be!), <a href="https://www.avo.app/inspector">learn more about Inspector</a>, <a href="mailto:hi@avo.app">reach out</a> or subscribe to our <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/avo">newsletter</a>.</p><h3><strong>Avo is scaling with the help of world-class developer and data tool investors</strong></h3><p>To build on our momentum, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/avo-raises-3m-for-its-analytics-governance-platform/">we’ve raised $3M</a> from GGV Capital with participation from Heavybit, Y Combinator and others, to make Avo a game changer for democratizing analytics.&nbsp;</p><p>I’d like to use this opportunity to thank all the incredible people who have believed in our team and our mission, and supported us throughout this journey. A special shoutout to Hjalli and Investa, Gustaf, Jared, Aaron, Kevin, Kat, Michael and all the YC folks, Joe, Tom, Dana, Jesse and James at Heavybit, Glenn, Oren, Tai and the entire crew at GGV, the Brunnur team, Jenny and co at Crowberry, Pete at Optimizely, Coby at Radar, Sandy, Ari and more. In addition to our investors, we’re surrounded with smart and generous people who have hosted us on their couches in San Francisco, helped us hire, advised us on Avo, introduced us to great people, et cetera; thank you to Spencer, June, Gunni, Jói, Aliya, Drew, Kiddi, Siggi, Hilmar, Arndís, Andrés, Kjartan, Paul, Gummi, Vala, Austin, Brian &amp; Michael, Leslie, Shuo, Alex, Ron and so many more.</p><p>Sölvi and I are proud to have been joined by an <a href="https://www.avo.app/about">outstanding team</a> of exceptionally kind, talented, and driven humans on this mission, who we are honored to be working with every day.</p><p>Our focus in the coming months will be helping more organizations uplevel their analytics governance fast, so they can join the global shift to self-serve analytics culture. We will also continue to focus on developer experience and seamless collaboration between product managers, developers and data scientists – because we don’t want teams to have to choose between product delivery speed and reliable analytics anymore.</p><p>‍</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://www.avo.app/jobs">We're hiring! </a>Come work with us in our remote-first culture (since way before COVID 😅) and diverse and inclusive team 💛</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><article><div><div><p><img src="https://www.pachyderm.com/images/blog-images/hub-ga-announcement-hero.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Today we’re announcing the production ready availability of <a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm Hub</a>, our powerful end-to-end machine learning and data lineage platform in the cloud. Hub delivers all the key features of the <a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a> suite but in a completely managed cloud-native environment. You no longer need to have Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure expertise in-house, Pachyderm Hub let’s you seamlessly spin up a cluster in minutes.</p><p>While Pachyderm always delivered the power teams needed to do data science at scale, you also needed a strong systems administration and architecture team to get Kubernetes and containers into production. Kuberenetes is way more than just software you download and install. It needs monitoring and management, backup, redundancy, capacity and upgrade planning, to name just a few. That represents a real challenge for some organizations. Now, we’ve removed the barriers to entry, which makes it possible for smaller teams to start doing data science faster.</p><p>Pachyderm Hub includes all of the features that were challenging for teams to set up, like autoscaling with GPUs, security and isolation, backup, and automation. Now you can rely on Pachyderm’s trained team of Kubernetes experts to handle the infrastructure for you and concentrate on data science instead of systems administration. Kubernetes is powerful, but the real power comes from the applications you can run on it.</p><blockquote><h4 id="you-simply-bring-your-code-and-data-pachyderm-hub-handles-all-the-infrastructure">You simply bring your code and data, Pachyderm Hub handles all the infrastructure.</h4></blockquote><p>More than anything, Pachyderm Hub delivers on our ultimate vision for a fully collaborative, shareable, and reproducible data science platform. It does what Git did for data, bringing powerful version control and collaboration to your AI applications development. Pachyderm Hub makes team collaboration and sharing data, code, and infra totally seamless. Team members can create and share workspaces, invite other team members to collaborate, and behind the scenes the platform scales transparently as you add workloads.</p><p>Since our launch 2014, Pachyderm’s data science platform has quickly become a foundation for the <a href="http://ai-infrastructure.org/">emerging Canonical Stack (CS) in machine learning</a>. Because other platforms only let you track metadata, they lack the true iron-clad immutability of a robust version controlled file system. If your data can change after you’ve recorded your metadata then you can’t reproduce critical data science results. Our customers understand the need for true data lineage and data versioning. That’s why over the past year, Pachyderm has attracted tremendous new enterprise customers like Shell, LogMeIn, Battelle Ecology, and AgBiome, as well as multiple government agencies, pharmaceutical and bioinformatics companies, two major North American banks, and other Fortune 500 powerhouses.</p><p>Beyond data versioning, customers choose Pachyderm because they need a clean, simple and elegant data science pipeline system that delivers data science at scale. The Pachyderm platform allows teams to bring any framework, language or library and fit them together into a smooth, automated workflow with ease. If it can run in a Docker container it can run on Pachyderm.Customers aren’t locked into one tool like Spark, R or Python, or one machine learning framework, like Pytorch or Tensorflow. They can use it all on one complete system.</p><blockquote><h4 id="launch-your-free-workspace-todayhttpshubpachydermcom"><a href="https://hub.pachyderm.com/">Launch your free workspace today!</a></h4></blockquote><p>If you’re ready to do production workloads you can easily upgrade to benefit from GPUs and enterprise team collaboration, just <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/request-a-demo/">talk with one of our experts</a></strong>, or join our <strong><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/slack/">open source community on Slack</a></strong> and check out the Pachyderm codebase on <strong><a href="https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm">Github</a></strong>.</p></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>When you learn a language, you think of words in it differently than how you think about words in your native tongue. I like the word “deflect.” I don’t know why, but it just has a nice ring to it. I like it so much that I worked on a (shuttered) developer-tool SaaS by that name some years ago. Do you know who else likes deflection? You, most likely.</p>



<blockquote><p>“No matter what I say, they keep doing the same things.”</p><p>“They don’t care about the product, only working on interesting tech.”</p><p>“Product keep defining work wrong.”</p><p>“The CEO wouldn’t allow it.”</p><p>“The team simply doesn’t have a high-bar culture.”</p></blockquote>



<p>How long has it been since you’ve said something along those lines, out loud or to yourself? Even the best executives I work with do this deflection by reflex from time to time. It’s leadership aikido.</p>



<h3>It might be true</h3>



<p>I can almost hear you mutter to yourself, “wait a minute! Those are all true!” I agree. The team might genuinely not care about the product right now. Perhaps the culture is out of whack when it comes to craftsmanship and quality. </p>



<p>That’s the only reason that deflection works as a coping and defense mechanism. If you’d simply say something that was clearly false, someone would call you out on it. You have a correct observation, at least subjectively. The issue is that you are abducting your responsibility for it.</p>



<h3>Total Ownership</h3>



<p>The most successful executives I work with are those who internalize that the vast majority of limits are self-imposed. If you deflect and put the blame on someone else, you teach yourself to be helpless. With time, you genuinely come to believe that you are powerless, as detailed in the (excellent) book Learned Optimism.</p>



<p>Reconsider the deflections above and think about what your role is in making those statements true. Why would the CEO allow something if you failed to make an articulated argument? This team you’re talking about, who hired it? Who has been managing and leading it?</p>



<p>Is everything entirely up to you? Of course not. A lot <em>is</em>, though. If you take ownership of the matter and decide to act, you will find ways to move forward in most cases. Do you know how just being told there’s a solution makes you find it? See a chessboard with the question “what would you do now,” and you might feel at a loss. Instead, if the prompt was “find the mate in two,” you are significantly more likely to find it. I once spent 90 minutes in an exam trying to prove P=NP because the instructor made an error writing the exam. I was told the given problem had a polynomial solution, and I gave it a damn good try.</p>



<p>Address your work problems with the same mindset. Take complete ownership. If you still come up empty, consider <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/">getting some help</a>. But don’t just deflect.</p>

<p>We started building ghcide over 2 years ago as part of our efforts at Digital Asset to provide a great IDE experience to all <a href="https://daml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML</a> users. As a lot of people in the Haskell community know, the DAML compiler is based on a modified version of GHC, so naturally the people working on it were Haskell programmers. As ghcide got better and better, and we got to experience it whenever we were working on DAML codebases, we started missing the same features from our Haskell development. Over time, we started abstracting over DAML-specifics and eventually managed to get it working on some hand-crafted Haskell projects, but couldn’t integrate with Cabal, Stack or other build tools. Around that time, we also open sourced the whole <a href="https://github.com/digital-asset/daml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAML codebase</a> which included ghcide – but we didn’t announce ghcide anywhere. Luckily, at this time Matthew Pickering released <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hie-bios</a> which made it trivial to integrate ghcide with all of the various build tools in the Haskell system while still using the same codebase as the basis for the DAML IDE.</p>



<p>External interest in ghcide was very limited until Neil gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijsaeWNf2E&amp;list=PLxxF72uPfQVRdAsvj7THoys-nVj-oc4Ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keynote at MuniHac 2019</a>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>Interest and external contributions skyrocketed over a few days and we split ghcide into a separate repository to make it easier for contributors and users that no longer had to deal with the DAML monorepo. Since then, there have been a huge number of contributions to ghcide that not only benefited Haskell users, but also DAML users. It is impossible to name all the amazing features that have been contributed to ghcide, but some of our favourites include:</p>



<ul><li>Support for code completions</li><li>Many significant performance improvements</li><li>Multi-component support</li><li>A wide variety of code actions</li></ul>



<p>In January 2020, a lot of ghcide contributors and contributors from <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-ide-engine</a> got together and agreed to unify their efforts as part of <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell-language-server</a> – which builds on top of ghcide while carrying over all the features and plugins that came from haskell-ide-engine. Half a year later, it’s not a stretch to say that this endeavour has been an enormous success and enthusiastic statements from users can attest to this. Finally, most efforts on Haskell tooling are focused on a single approach and everyone can benefit from improvements.</p>



<p>As the importance of ghcide to Haskell tooling has grown, keeping such an important repository in the Digital Asset organisation with only Digital Asset employees as maintainers has started to hold back the flood of contributions. Therefore, in consultation with many of the contributors, Digital Asset has made the decision to turn ghcide into a proper community project under the <a href="https://github.com/haskell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haskell</a> github organization. In making this transition, ghcide gains a much wider team of maintainers, sourced from the current active ghcide contributors. The DAML IDE will switch to an open source fork of ghcide and cherry-pick changes from upstream as needed and we will continue to upstream bugfixes and improvements into ghcide.</p>



<p>We are very excited to see in which directions ghcide will grow in the future. Thanks to all ghcide contributors and in particular to Pepe Iborra, Matthew Pickering, Alan Zimmermann, wz1000, Luke Lau, Alejandro Serrano, fendor and Jacek Generowicz. We’ve enjoyed being part of the Haskell IDE tooling community, and look forward to working with both current and new contributors in the future.</p>

</svg><span>SzFE students blockade the entrance to the university.</span><span>Fotó: Kremmer Sarolta</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following a demonstration on Monday, around 250 students occupied the university's Budapest campus, saying they would not allow any members of the new leadership to enter the building. The students' <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-vidnyanszky-fele-kuratorium-lemondasat-kovetelik-az-egyetemet-elfoglalo-diakok" target="_blank">list of demands</a> includes:<br></p><ul>
<li>guaranteed autonomy for the university</li>
<li>the revocation of the law which alters their university's management model</li>
<li>the resignation of the new board of directors</li>
<li>reinstatement of powers to the democratically elected senate&nbsp;</li>
<li>rejection of the new method of appointing university leaders and board members</li>
<li>continued state funding of the university</li>
<li>that the administrative rights over the university not be transferred to the foundation.</li>
</ul><p>At a press conference in front of the building on Tuesday, a delegation of students said they would only allow current staff and students to enter the building until further notice. According to an <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/felmeres-az-szfe-hallgatoinak-100-szazaleka-elutasitja-ahogy-az-egyetem-vidnyanszkyek-kezebe-kerult" target="_blank">internal poll</a> taken by the university's Students' Union (HÖK), 100 percent of student respondents rejected the restructuring, and nearly 70 percent believe&nbsp;its true aim is the "long-term, ideological and political occupation of the institution.”</p><p>As a result of the restructuring, key decision-making powers will be exercised by the board of directors of the foundation, including adoption of operational regulations, budgetary decisions and development plans, as well as the selection of the rector and the appointment of department heads. Members of the new board of directors include two executives of the state-owned energy company MOL. The chairman of the board is Attila Vidnyánszky,&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/29/itt-a-vege-vidnyanszkyek-kezi-vezerlessel-iranyithatjak-az-szfe-t" target="_blank">a former director of the Hungarian National Theatre</a> who has routinely made <a href="https://szfe.hu/hirek/egyetlen-kerdes/" target="_blank">derisive comments</a> about SzFE and its faculty, and is considered to be a close ally of the ruling Fidesz party.&nbsp;</p><p>
As we reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/06/25/fearing-for-its-autonomy-university-holds-protest-against-privatization-plan" target="_blank">June</a>, university leaders and students have argued that the transfer of ownership of the 155-year-old state-run university to a private foundation is an&nbsp;attempt to place it under political control and centrally dictate its operations and cultural output. Some observers also&nbsp;<a href="https://444.hu/2020/06/24/kevesebb-raforditassal-nagyobb-kontroll-errol-szol-az-egyetemek-alapitvanyi-kiszervezese" target="_blank">predict that the quasi-privatization of SzFE and other Hungarian universities will result in further state divestment from higher education</a>&nbsp;while reducing the universities' autonomy.</p><h2>Citizens of V4 countries may enter Hungary despite border closures</h2><p>Citizens of three central European countries will be <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/a-csehek-mellett-a-lengyelek-es-a-szlovakok-is-belephetnek-magyarorszagra" target="_blank">granted exceptional permission to enter Hungary</a> following coronavirus-related border closures that took effect on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced on Monday.</p><p>
Czech, Slovak and Polish citizens that booked accommodations in Hungary before September 1 will be allowed to enter the country if they present a negative coronavirus test no more than five days old.&nbsp;The border closure, which <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/28/gulyas-szigorubb-intezkedesek-jonnek-szeptember-elejetol" target="_blank">banned entry to nearly all foreign citizens</a> after a steep rise in new coronavirus cases in Hungary, will remain in effect for citizens of all other countries.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--KTfLMUSI--/7Uxbrk3zBL6n1Dqqys.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

On Monday, the exception was extended to all citizens of V4 countries.<br></p><p>Critics of the decision argued that entering Hungary is now easier for foreign citizens of the V4 than for Hungarian citizens returning from abroad: upon arrival, Hungarians must submit to a 14-day quarantine period which can only be abridged by two negative PCR tests conducted in Hungary at their own expense. (Orbán's chief of staff earlier said that the government does not consider tests conducted abroad to be reliable.) The exception allows V4 citizens to enter with only one test, conducted in their own countries, and does not require quarantine. Similar exceptions were made for <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/egy-kulfoldi-sportolonak-sokkal-egyszerubb-bejutnia-a-frissen-lezart-magyarorszagra-mint-egy-magyar-allampolgarnak" target="_blank">foreign participants in Hungarian sporting events</a>.</p><p>On Monday, two members of the European Commission <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/unios-biztosok-levelet-irtak-a-magyar-kormanynak-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-valo-kivetelezes-miatt" target="_blank">wrote a letter to Hungary</a>,&nbsp;arguing the exceptions for V4 citizens threatened "the integrity of the Schengen area and of applying border measures in a non-discriminatory way to all EU citizens and residents."</p><p>The government defended the border closures by saying that introduction of the coronavirus from abroad represents the greatest epidemiological risk. However, a pandemic advisor to the government said in an interview Monday that <a href="https://444.hu/2020/08/31/nagyon-veszelyes-jarvanyugyi-helyzetre-figyelmeztet-a-kormanynak-szakerto-matematikus-professzor" target="_blank">less than 10 percent of new virus cases in Hungary can be attributed to foreign travel</a>.</p><p><a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/01/a-jarvany-szempontjabol-erthetetlen-miert-kivetelezunk-a-visegradi-orszagokkal-a-hatarokon" target="_blank">Recent statistics from the V4 countries</a> raise questions over Hungary's decision to grant travel exemptions to their citizens: daily new coronavirus cases in Czechia, Slovakia and Poland have risen dramatically in recent days with Poland registering six times more daily cases than Hungary. At the end of August, each of the three countries had an exponentially higher rate of cases per million people when compared to Hungary.</p><h2>Free press organizations call on EU to take action against Hungary's use of funds to undermine media freedom</h2><p>A group of 16 press freedom organizations has <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/02/ujsagiro-es-jogvedo-szervezetek-szolitjak-fel-az-uniot-lepjen-fel-a-magyar-mediapiac-allami-torzitasaval-szemben" target="_blank">called on the European Union to take action against Hungary</a> for alleged violations of EU state aid rules to undermine media pluralism.</p><p>In a <a href="https://ipi.media/eu-must-act-on-hungary-media-market-distortion/" target="_blank">letter to&nbsp;EU Competition Commissioner Margarethe Vestager</a>, the organizations wrote that&nbsp;the Hungarian government "has pursued a strategy of deliberately manipulating the media market, bending rules designed to prevent free and fair competition and weaponizing state resources to punish critical media and reward government mouthpieces".</p><p>The letter cites two state aid complaints, filed with the European Commission in 2016 and 2018, that concern Hungarian media freedom. The first involved Hungary's public broadcaster "showing deliberate and clear bias in favour of the Fidesz party," while the second presented "extensive evidence around the government’s market-distorting practices" in distributing state advertising in media outlets.&nbsp;The letter claims that the distribution of such advertising "follows no market logic" and is "almost exclusively geared toward propping up pro-government media".</p><p>"We are seriously concerned that the Commission’s failure thus far to respond to these complaints perpetuates the Hungarian government’s market-distorting practices and allows for the further decimation of independent media in the country," the letter reads. "The <a href="https://insighthungary.444.hu/2020/07/23/resignations-begin-at-index-after-firing-of-editor-in-chief-protest-for-press-freedom-planned" target="_blank">turmoil at Index.hu</a> shows clearly that the situation will continue to worsen. The Hungarian public’s access to sources of balanced news and information is in greater danger than ever before."</p><h2>Public employees go on three-day strike as government refuses negotiations</h2><ul>
<li>Increased pay grades</li>
<li>the reimbursement of local governments for pandemic defense expenses</li>
<li>financial support for protecting the jobs of public employees</li>
<li>the repeal of government decisions to appropriate automobile taxes and suspend tourist taxes, and</li>
<li>the abolition of the "solidarity tax" demanded from local governments.</li>
</ul><p>Striking public employees made these demands of the government as they <a href="https://444.hu/2020/09/02/hiaba-sztrajkolnak-a-kormany-nem-targyal-az-onkormanyzati-dolgozok-erdekkeviseletevel" target="_blank">staged a three-day strike</a> beginning on Wednesday. According to the Union of Public Officials, Civil Servants and Public Workers (MKKSZ), 5,358 local government employees across Hungary are taking part in the strike, representing some 17 percent of the sector. Most strikers are not staging total work stoppages, with many engaging in two-hour "warning strikes", the union said.</p><figure><a rel="nofollow" href="https://4cdn.hu/kraken/image/upload/s--mnltoODe--/7HRfzFU6dPJK1Jgqks.jpeg"></a><figcaption><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid">

This could lead to mass dismissals of public employees, it said.<br></p><p>According to MKKSZ president Mrs. Péter Boros, Interior Minister Sándor Pintér informed the union in a letter that the government would not negotiate with the public workers, arguing local governments had received adequate support from the state.&nbsp;</p><p>"A pandemic is not the time to pull apart and inflame tensions," Pintér wrote.</p><h2>For regular English language updates, sign up for the free InsightHungary newsletter here:</h2>

<p><em>Lately, I have been talking a lot about Crystal - probably too much if you ask my coworkers at Kalvad. So let me explain once and for all why Crystal is such an amazing language and how it will quickly grow in popularity.</em></p><p>Since I started to write code, I have always been looking for the perfect programming language. A language combining clarity, easy of use and performances. Nothing more, but nothing less either. In this quest of perfection, I've being playing with a lot of languages, but I always had some complains with the most famous ones: JavaScript is over-permissive, Python is great, but as all scripted language (Ruby, PHP, ...) they lack of performances. C/C++ or even Rust works well, but at the cost of ease of use and readability. Golang brought some fresh air into Software industry but its package system is terrible. <br>At this point, you might have noticed that I am really picky person. Which emphasize how amazing Crystal is.<br></p><h2 id="crystal-in-a-few-lines">Crystal in a few lines</h2><p>If you check out the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">website</a>, you will quickly grasp the main concepts of Crystal:</p><ul><li>compiled: better performances &amp; limit errors at run time</li><li>statically type checked: means you can omit types but they are still here and the code won't compile if a type is ambiguous. It increase code readability and limit error at run time.</li><li>types are non-nullable by default: crystal said NO to the famous billion dollar mistake</li><li>green concurrency: just like channels in go, Crystal allows to easily run async tasks and share data without using shared memory and locks</li><li>ruby-like syntax: reading crystal is like reading a book. Really</li><li>shards: one of the best package system ever built</li><li>an amazing standard library</li><li>... and lot of other cool things: C binding, macros, native unit test, native template system, everything is an object, etc.</li></ul><h2 id="crystal-in-depth">Crystal in depth</h2><p>Code is worth a thousand of words.</p><h3 id="syntax-and-readability">Syntax and readability</h3><p>Crystal has a Ruby-like syntax, but it also add some cool feature to improve code organization such as modules.</p><pre><code>module Controllers # use module to scope your code

  class ApiResult
    property http_code : Int16
    property message : String
    property data : Json::Any
    
    # our class constructor
    def initialize(@http_code, @message, @data)
    	# automatically set the properties based on the variables names
    end
  end

  class UserController &lt; Controller
    # create a login method which return an 'ApiResult' object
    def login : ApiResult
    
      # '!' by convention means that this function raises an exception in case of failure
      params.validate!

      # '?' means that the function will return 'nil' in case of failure
      user = Models::User.find_by_email? params["email"]
      
      # clear one-liner, '?' here means the function returns a boolean
      return ApiResult.new(404, "user not found", nil) if user.nil?
      
      # last value of a function is automatically returned
      ApiResult.new 200, "ok", {
        token: Services::JWT.encode(user.id.as(String)),
        user: user
      }.to_json
      
    rescue
      # You can add a 'rescue' for the whole funtion. How convenient is that
      ApiResult.new 500, "Oops. Something happened!", nil
    ensure
      # And finally you can use 'ensure' to always run a piece of code
      Services::Log.action "new login"
    end
  end
end</code></pre><h3 id="types">Types<br></h3><p>Types in Crystal are very powerful. Crystal is a strictly typed language but thanks to type inference, the compiler will be able to assign types by himself. Therefore, unless the type of a variable is ambiguous for the compiler, you can omit to write it down.</p><p>On top of that, types are non nullable by default but can be set as nullable by adding a '?' at the end of the type declaration. Let see some code.</p><pre><code># return 'hello' if @input is an Int32 or a null value if @input is a boolean
def hello_world(input : Bool|Int32) : String? # since this function can return a null value, we need to set the return value as a nullable string using '?'
  typeof(input) == Int32 ? "hello" : nil
end

def main
  puts hello_world(true) # =&gt; "[nil]"
  hello_world(1) # =&gt; "hello" 
end</code></pre><h3 id="everything-is-object">Everything is object</h3><p>And you can extend everything ! The code below parse a YAML file and push the content into an array.</p><pre><code>class Array(T)
  # Extend the Array class to add a new class method
  def self.from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path : String)
    # Simply read a YML file from a pathname and parse it into an array of EnvItem defined below
    File.open(file_path) { |f| Array(T).from_yaml(f) }
  end
end

module Envcr

  class EnvItem
    YAML.mapping(
      name: String,
      optional: {type: Bool, default: false},
      default: String?,
    )
    def eval
      # do whatever you need here with the values
    end
  end

  def load!(file_path : String)
    # Use the newly created 'from_envcr_yaml_file' function method to build an array of EnvItem from a YML file
    Array(EnvItem).from_envcr_yaml_file(file_path).each { |x| x.eval }
    #...
  end

  # ...

end</code></pre><h3 id="standard-library">Standard Library</h3><p>The Crystal standard library offers a lot of amazing features. As a direct result, the different libraries and frameworks will rely on the same core components. And you know what is cool about that? You will always get back on your feet even with when learning a different library/frameworks.</p><p>See, below are 2 piece of code from 2 different projects using 2 different frameworks. However, notice how both simply expose the standard <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.34.0/HTTP/Request.html" rel="nofollow">HTTP request object</a><br></p><pre><code># Middleware inside a Kemal project
class AuthMiddleware &lt; Kemal::Handler
    def call(context)
        return call_next context if context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization") == false
            || context.request.headers["Authorization"] == ""
        user_id = Services::JWT.decode(context.request.headers["Authorization"].split(' ')[1])
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><pre><code># Middleware inside an Amber project
  class Auth &lt; Amber::Pipe::Base
    def call(context)
        return unauthorized context unless context.request.headers.has_key?("Authorization")
            &amp;&amp; context.request.headers["Authorization"] != ""
        parse_jwt context, context.request.headers["Authorization"]
        # ...
    end
    # ...
end</code></pre><h3 id="shards">Shards</h3><p>Shard is the package system of Crystal. And it's one of the best out there. You can simply create a new crystal project using <code>crystal init</code> :</p><p> - <code>crystal init app cool_stuff</code> will generate a new binary application<br> - <code>crystal init lib cool_stuff</code> will generate a new library</p><p>In both case, the folder created will look like that:</p><pre><code>├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── shard.yml
├── spec
│   ├── cool_stuff.cr
│   └── spec_helper.cr
└── src
    └── cool_stuff.cr</code></pre><p>Congratulations, you just created a new Crystal shard. You can then edit 'shard.yml' to add dependencies, edit the author or add a description, and once you are done, you can simply push your project on github (on https://github.com/dlacreme/cool_stuff for example).</p><p>And once your project is available on github, you can import it on any other Crystal application:</p><pre><code># shard.yml
dependencies:
  cool_stuff:
    github: dlacreme/cool_stuff
    branch: master</code></pre><h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-crystal">What can you do with Crystal?</h2><p>Crystal can be used for pretty much everything. However, I believe it has 2 domains in which it performs better:</p><ul><li>low-level programming. Thanks to its awesome standard library, you can pretty much do everything out of box in a few lines of code. In case the standard library does not have what you need, you can simply embed some C code</li><li>back-end system. Born during the web era, back-end developers quickly built strong web frameworks in Crystal</li></ul><h2 id="current-status-future-of-crystal">Current status &amp; Future of Crystal</h2><p>Crystal is still in beta. Currently running v0.35, it's actually the last version before the first stable release (v1) which is expected before 2021. However, we will still needs a few years to build the whole ecosystem around it. We have some strong frameworks and libraries already, but they all still need to reach their own v1.</p><p>Also, it's important to note Crystal is still not fully running on Windows. It is actually a requirement for the v1 of Crystal and this is one of the main focus of the core team. Hopefully, this won't be an issue for long.</p><h2 id="why-crystal-will-slowly-climb-to-the-top">Why Crystal will slowly climb to the top &nbsp;</h2><p>To end this post, and now you have a better overview of what Crystal can do, let me explain why I think Crystal will become one of the major programming languages:</p><ul><li>readability and access: Crystal is very easy to learn and it's even easier if you have some experience with Ruby. Crystal can easily be used by a wide range of developers.</li><li>performances: Crystal is fast. Very fast. And fast is always better</li><li>release error-less product: thanks to unit tests, strict types and non-nilable types, you can only build stronger products</li><li>fast development: with its awesome package manager &amp; extended standard library, you can focus on the core of your product</li><li>web friendly: Crystal natively provides everything you need to build a web application (native template system, great HTTP standard library). It will slowly slide into every tech-stack</li></ul><p>In short, Crystal is the best and I hope to see you soon into the Crystal community !</p><p>... and I am done for today.</p><blockquote>Have fun coding and talk to you soon !</blockquote>

September 3, 2020 | https://helecloud.com/blog/recovering-failure-in-aws-on-a-tuesday-morning/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://helecloud.com/blog/recovering-failure-in-aws-on-a-tuesday-morning/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By Will Hall</em></p><p>As I am sure many of you know, AWS had an Availability Zone failure within the EU-West-2 (London) region on Tuesday 25th August. But how, where and what do you do when you are a managed services company trying to ensure appropriate availability for your customers across AWS?</p><p>Tuesdays, in August, in the UK, are often punctuated by the drinking of tea, not large failures to happen in AWS. Realistically, datacentre major events are not particularly common, and major outages are even less common, largely due to either extreme natural phenomenon or scaled configuration errors (where the latter is far more likely).</p><h2>All was not OK in EU-West-2</h2><p>From a HeleCloud perspective, the first thing to alert us to the issues was the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) we run for one of our customers informed us that there was degraded performance across an ElasticSearch cluster. Whilst these events are not regular, they are also not unheard of. That said, in such cases we move between infrastructure, releasing instances from the failing piece of infrastructure and quickly rebuild within a new location without any performance degradation. However, this event was not the same as we were having issues communicating via the API. The AWS API is the core connection between the outside world requesting resources and infrastructure and the datacentre.</p><p>Upon seeing these alerts, we immediately opened a request with AWS Support highlighting the challenge and set about trying to understand the scope and complexity of the issue. When referencing back, we were aware of the issue around 02:16 PT, which was around 10 minutes after AWS had become aware of the issue (addressed in later status updates).</p><h2>Diagnosing the issue</h2><p>One of the great advantages of us running Managed Services for many clients is that not only do we have experience of a great range of different challenges but we also have a range of different estates that are simultaneously running infrastructure across the whole of AWS, so you can compare across different accounts, Regions and Availability Zones to discover outages more quickly.</p><p>Whilst the Managed Services team were keeping our customers informed on the potential issues, we were also reaching out across the company to build a consensus about what the issue was and how we could aim to mitigate it. By using our knowledge across the AWS estate, we could see that the problem was focussed on EC2 and RDS instances and further investigation showed us that it was within the euw2-az2 availability zone (also called eu-west2b).</p><p>A good secondary check is always to check various places on the Web to see if others are complaining about outages also. Reddit and Twitter are usually quite fast in these kinds of outage situations. This is just to support the results of our investigation and for us is just another data point that we like to keep an eye on.</p><h2>Beginning to Resolve the Issues</h2><p>Now that we had diagnosed the issue as being EC2 and RDS in euw2-az2, we started mitigation efforts to resolve our issues. With the root cause being both within connectivity and performance of the infrastructure in that Availability Zone, it was not simply a question of restarting the instances, which should move to working hardware. As you are probably aware, running in multiple Availability Zones is part of AWS architectural planning and normally you would plan to run instances in more than 1 Availability Zone for exactly this kind of situation, however, the first thing to do was identify all of the failing underlying infrastructure to start to mitigate the problem. The process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Identify anything running only in euw2-az2 (that is going to be failing now)</li><li>Identify anything running partly in euw2-az2 (that is going to be underperforming)</li><li>Migrate or move anything that can be moved to other availability zones where possible.</li></ol><p>For services such as RDS, the challenge was within database servers that were only located in a single AZ as multi-AZ databases were already mitigating the issue to a different availability zone. Having effective infrastructure as code meant that we were able to move the majority of these services, within a short window and architecturally there were very few single AZ databases. In general, we avoid running RDS instances in production environments in a single Availability Zone for exactly this reason.</p><h2>Minimal Disruption Migration</h2><p>As with any kind of issue resolution, the aim is to provide minimal disruption to end services whilst resolving the problem, for instances that were already within euw2-az2 they already had severe degradation and therefore it was critical to be able to move them from that availability zone to another to recover applications and services.</p><p>We began looking to move services out of the Availability Zone within the first hour of the issue and ran team-wide discussions on how to best resolve with minimal disruption. We mention minimal disruption as with being a managed services and professional services company it is important to run our customer workloads with the utmost of care. However, within the first 2 hours of disruption, we were able to resolve, mitigate and address 80% of the issues within the AZ.</p><div><figure><img src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png" alt="" width="815" height="819" srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, 100vw" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20815%20819'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-980x985.png 980w, https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-480x482.png 480w" data-lazy-src="https://helecloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Article_Pic-1019x1024.png"></figure></div><h2>What We Learnt from the Outage</h2><p>There are a few learnings to come from the recovery of euw2-az2. Firstly, it does matter that you architect your solutions to be multi-availability zone (multi-AZ). There is a big difference between being multi-region (EU-west-1, EU-west-2, EU-central-1) and multi-availability zone and for the majority of production services, <strong>we would not recommend anything that does not run across multiple availability zones.</strong></p><p>Secondly, there is no replacement for knowledge and experience. Having a team of our best people working and probing to try and find the limits and extent of the issue was vital in us both understanding and mitigating the problem quickly. I would suggest that when this situation arises again, get together with other clever people (whether that be internally on Slack/Teams or externally on Twitter) and try to find solutions.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Conversations around window managers can be a little contentious…but for some of us, it makes very little difference. I'm one of those humans. As much as I adore nerding out around some ultra-minimal window manager that requires you change settings by compiling its c code, at the end of the day I gain little benefit from any specific approach.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AK2UKUfsV3g" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p>That said, I do love and prefer Linux. The fact that we're afforded these choices around window managers is what draws many of us in initially. Your computer, whether running Ubuntu or Arch, can flip a switch to run a very capable, heavy-weight manager such as <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> or a manager with a binary size of ~1mb, such as <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>. Before diving too deep into my day-to-day workflow, let's set some primer around window managers.</p><h2 id="window-managers">Window Managers</h2><p>Window managers come in two, primary, varieties. These include stacked and tiled. Tiled are commonly composed of several “workspaces”, which can be switched through and host one or many windows, tiled side-by-side. They (typically, by default) do not allow windows to stack or overlap. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for i3.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/i3.png" alt=""></p><p>Stacked window managers, on the other hand, are what we conventionally think of. Especially those of us that have a history with OSX (mac) or Windows. These window managers give us floating windows that can overlap and be moved into any format on our screens. The following screenshot, from Wikipedia, demonstrates this for xfce.</p><p><img src="https://octetz.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/why-i-dont-care-about-my-window-manager/xfce.png" alt=""></p><p>From my experience, many have associated the move to tiling managers as a more hardcore approach to interacting with Linux. Or at least one we associate with focus, minimalism, and/or getting things done. Over the years, some using i3 and others using dwm, I have found my productivity remain relatively static. I did have some super cool layouts that I loved looking at. However, I am a habitual over-optimizer. This trait sends me down constant rabbit holes of thinking through what workspace I should assign to which tasks, how I should be setting up a tiling layout for optimal focus, and many more considerations. Eventually I realized this constant customization was causing me more loss in focus than the gain I'd hoped to have leaving stacked managers behind.</p><p>In short, this was a me problem, not a tiling window manager problem. Knowing myself better now, I have switched back to stacked managers, with optimizations and automation focused around my key priorities.</p><h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2><p>My priorities around workflow are fairly straight forward. Given I have the attention span of a small squirrel, my key priorities are:</p><ol><li>Switch between key applications quickly</li><li>Switch between key applications with minimal context-switching</li></ol><p>So switching between applications, this isn't too hard in any window manager, is it? Sure, it is not. However minimizing the thought required to jump from a to b is huge for my work. For example, at the most intense end of the spectrum, clicking around and moving windows to find firefox is less than ideal. Even using flows like alt+tab or a launcher requires me to think about where the thing is or how to find/focus it. Additionally, the applications I care about and need to switch between are fairly minimal in quantity. There are maybe 7 total with 4 key ones I constantly toggle. These are:</p><ul><li>Web Browser (firefox)</li><li>Terminal (st)</li><li>IDE (intellij)</li><li>File browser (nemo)</li></ul><p>For me, the question is, with a key or two, can I bring up the application I need to get the task done no matter where it preexisted. Additionally, if the app isn't running, can I transparently launch it without being concerned about another shortcut or workflow? This is where my most important trick comes in, a script named <code>lof</code> (launch or focus).</p><h2 id="launch-or-focus-lof">Launch or Focus (lof)</h2><p><code>lof</code> is a simple script that does exactly what the name implies. If the app isn't running, it launches it. If the app is, it focuses it. <code>lof</code> is not a unique solution. For example there is <a href="https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp">jumpapp</a>, which is a far more capable tool than <code>lof</code>. I have chosen to write <code>lof</code> because it is less than 20 lines of shell script (when comments are removed), easy to understand, and handles 97% of my use cases.</p><p><code>lof</code> can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof">octetz/linux-desktop repository</a>. I have <a href="https://octetz.com/docs/2020/2020-02-23-linux-desktop-configuration/">another blog</a> post on how I use this repo, if you're interested. At the time of this writing, the script looks something like this.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span># lof: launch or focus</span>
<span># this script checks whether an app is running and</span>
<span># if running, focuses the window</span>
<span># if not running, launches the app</span>

<span># this script is likely called from another command or script</span>

<span># usage: lof [arg]</span>
<span># [arg]: provide the full path, arguments, and flags representing the process</span>
<span># The value of arg will be looked up literally in the process list by wrapping [arg] in ^ (start) and $ (end)</span>
<span># for example, to ensure the correct firefox window is launched, lof would be used as follows:</span>
<span># lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</span>

<span># for web-based apps, nodejs-natifier can be used to generate a desktop binary</span>
<span># https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nodejs-nativefier</span>

<span># this script assumes the app exists and wmctrl is installed</span>
<span># checks do not occur to ensure optimal performance</span>

APP_NAME<span>=</span><span>"</span>$1<span>"</span>

<span># find pid for app process</span>
<span># -f includes the entire process details, including arguments and flags</span>
APP_PID<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$(</span>pgrep -f <span>"</span><span>^</span><span>${</span>APP_NAME<span>}</span>$<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span>

<span># if app is not running, start it</span>
<span># if app is running, focus it</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> -z <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
  <span># launch app</span>
  $APP_NAME
<span>else</span>
  <span># using the pid, find the window id, then focus it</span>
  wid<span>=</span><span>$(</span>wmctrl -lp | grep <span>"</span>$APP_PID<span>"</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span><span>)</span>
  <span># -R moves the window to the current desktop AND brings it to focus</span>
  wmctrl -iR <span>"</span>$wid<span>"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code>'s goal is to determine if an app is running and if it's not, launch it. If it is running, it stores the process id and correlates that to the window id. Once the window id is found, it focuses the window, using a tool called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wmctrl">wmctrl</a>. For example, my usage of <code>lof</code> for firefox is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p><code>lof</code> expects to resolve the <strong>exact</strong> command when it runs <code>pgrep</code>, this enables <code>lof</code> to be very specific around what window it looks up. If you're interested in the gory details of how these pieces fit together, keep reading this section. Otherwise, you should skip to the next section.</p><p>To understand <code>lof</code>, it is important to understand how window ids and process ids are related. Technically, we can look up windows by their titles, however, many applications re-title their window based on the context of where the user is in the app. Thus, correlating process id to window id is preferable. Assuming firefox is running, you can lookup its window id with <code>wmctrl</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp

0x01800003 -1 <span>899</span>    taco xfce4-panel
0x01000028 -1 <span>945</span>    taco Desktop
0x02e00006  <span>0</span> <span>1139</span>   taco tmux
0x0300004d  <span>0</span> <span>2804</span>   taco linux-desktop – lof
0x03200003  <span>0</span> <span>5276</span>   taco Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox
0x06200006  <span>0</span> <span>7115</span>   taco VLC media player
</code></pre></div><p>In the above desktop, <em>Arch Linux - Mozilla Firefox</em> is clearly the firefox window. The process id is <code>5276</code> and the window id is <code>0x03200003</code>. Since <code>lof</code> resolves based on the process's command, we should look that up using the process id.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps <span>5276</span>

PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
<span>5276</span> pts/2    Sl    13:49 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
</code></pre></div><p>And just like that, we know that <code>/usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is the correct argument to send to <code>lof</code>. When <code>lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox</code> is run, <code>pgrep</code> is used to resolve a process with that <strong>exact</strong> command. If <code>pgrep</code> returns no result, <code>lof</code> executes the command it was fed as an argument. If <code>pgrep</code> did find a result, it can use the process id to run the above <code>wmctrl -lp</code> command and resolve the window id via <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wmctrl -lp | grep <span>5276</span> | awk <span>'{print $1}'</span>

0x03200003
</code></pre></div><p>It then uses <code>wmctrl -iR</code> to focus the firefox window.</p><p>And that end-to-end is <code>lof</code>! There are times where some apps, such as those requiring JRE, need more love than <code>lof</code> can handle. In those cases, rather than making <code>lof</code> smarter, I chose to write a slightly modified script. You can find an example with my <a href="https://github.com/octetz/linux-desktop/blob/master/s/lof_intellij">lof_intellij</a> script in GitHub.</p><h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2><p>The glue that holds this all together is the shortcuts or key bindings. For key bindings, I use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xbindkeys">xbindkeys</a>. The reason I prefer it over other tools, is its generic approach to capturing mouse or keyboard events. Captured events can execute scripts in <strong>any window manager</strong>. This means that when I randomly decide to switch back to dwm, all my keys bindings come with me.</p><p>xbindkeys, assuming it is installed, can be added to your <code>~/.xinitrc</code> file to launch when you start your window manager. An example of mine is:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">exec xrdb ~/.Xresources &amp;
xset r rate <span>150</span> <span>60</span> &amp;
<span># only required when wm does not have compositor</span>
<span># exec picom &amp;</span>
feh --bg-scale ~/photos/wallpapers/current.jpg &amp;
xbindkeys -p &amp;
<span># options are dwm, i3, and startxfce4</span>
exec startxfce4
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>-p</code> flag tells <code>xbindkeys</code> to poll the rc (configuration) file for changes. The last step is to setup this rc file to include the <code>lof</code> commands. The rc file is, by default, located at <code>~/.xbindkeysrc</code>. On my machine, a some of the configuration look as follows.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># launch demu</span>
<span>"dmenu_run -fn Hack-16:normal -l 5"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:65
    Mod4 + space

<span># launch browser</span>
<span>"lof /usr/lib/firefox/firefox"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:45
    Mod4 + k

<span># launch or focus terminal</span>
<span>"lof st\ \-e\ tmux"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:44
    Mod4 + j

<span># launch or focus nemo</span>
<span>"lof nemo"</span>
    m:0x40 + c:40
    Mod4 + d
</code></pre></div><p>You can see the many uses of <code>lof</code>. The quoted text is the script to be run when an event is detected for the key codes below it. <code>xbindkeys</code> offers a simple way to figure out these key strokes. You run <code>xbindkeys -k</code> and hit the key you want to resolve. For example, this is the result of <code>mod</code> (window key) + <code>e</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xbindkeys -k

Press combination of keys or/and click under the window.
You can use one of the two lines after <span>"NoCommand"</span>
in $HOME/.xbindkeysrc to bind a key.
<span>"(Scheme function)"</span>
    m:0x4 + c:26
    Control + e
</code></pre></div><p>Now, assume you want to use that as a keyboard shortcut for the GUI app <code>blueman-manager</code> (a bluetooth utility). With the app running, you lookup the command.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ps aux | grep -i blueman-manager

<p>How Emacs beat vi in the Editor Wars</p>
<p>August 11, 2020&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://trevorjim.com/how-emacs-beat-vi-in-the-editor-wars/">∞</a></p>
<p>In these dark times, we are all in sore need of good news.
Thankfully, I can report some: Emacs has defeated vi in the Editor
Wars!</p>
<p>Some people, laughably, believe that vi is more popular than Emacs.
Fortunately, these fools are completely wrong, and it is easily
proven.</p>
<p>Here’s how.  Take out an iPhone and get it set up with a Bluetooth
keyboard.  Open a web browser and start typing in the address bar.
Try a few Emacs key bindings: control-a (move-beginning-of-line);
control-e (move-end-of-line); control-b (backward-char); control-k
(kill-line); control-d (delete-char); control-y (yank).</p>
<p>That’s right, Emacs is in your phone browser!  With more than 2
billion iPhones shipped, that’s more than 2 billion Emacs
installations.  And if you try other phone or desktop browsers you
just might find that Emacs is in those as well.  But you won’t find
vi.</p>
<p>QED, losers!</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-key-bindings">The importance of key bindings</h2>
<p>Perhaps you are wondering, is it really fair to judge the dominance of
Emacs solely based on key bindings?  What about all of the other ways
in which Emacs is superior to vi?</p>
<p>Rest easy, friend.  Consider that most users of any editor only use
basic features, such as the ones mentioned above (moving to the end of
a line, deleting a line, etc.).  For these users, Emacs and vi are
functionally equivalent—each as powerful as the other.</p>
<p>So, if two editors have the same functionality, what distinguishes one
from another?  It is the way that the editor exposes editing functions
to the user—the user interface.  And for Emacs and vi, which were
created in the early days of text-based terminals without mice, that
means the keyboard interface, i.e., their key bindings.</p>
<h2 id="how-emacs-key-bindings-are-superior-to-vi-key-bindings">How Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key bindings</h2>
<p>We have proven that Emacs key bindings are superior to vi key
bindings: Emacs has won the marketplace, while vi heads to extinction.
But <em>why</em> are they better?</p>
<p>To answer this we defer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler">Larry
Tesler</a>, who
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/2212877.2212896">developed</a>
the now-ubiquitous editor functions, Cut and Paste.  Before Cut and
Paste, moving a block of text in a document was a complex, multi-step
command in editors: it was a <em>mode</em> of the editor, distinct from other
operations such as moving the cursor or inserting characters.</p>
<p>Tesler’s Cut and Paste enables moving a block of text <em>without</em>
introducing a new mode.  In between the operations of Cut and Paste
the user can insert characters and move the cursor as usual; the
normal mode of insert/cursor movement, combined with a simple Cut and
a simple Paste, allows you to move a block of text.  You don’t have to
learn a new, complex mode for this.</p>
<p>This is what Tesler called <em>modelessness</em>.  Now, in reality every
editor has more than one mode, but Tesler argued that fewer modes make
editors easier to use, and Emacs and vi demonstrate this nicely.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke about vi: <em>Once you use vi, you’ll never quit.</em>
This of course refers to the fact that frequently in vi you’ll get
stuck in a mode that you can’t get out of, because you’ve forgotten
what mode you are in, or you’ve forgotten the key binding to get to
the mode in which you can exit vi.  So for example, vi has a mode
where you can insert characters; a different mode where you can move
the cursor, delete lines, and so on; and yet another mode in which you
can do things like quit the editor.  And depending on which mode you
are in, you have to hit a different sequence of keys to quit the
editor.  That’s why “How do I quit vi?” is such a popular Google
search.</p>
<p>Emacs, in contrast, starts out in a mode in which you can do <em>all</em> of
those things.  It crams all of that functionality into one mode by,
you guessed it, using <em>a lot</em> of key bindings involving modifiers like
the Control key and Meta key.</p>
<p>Emacs, to be sure, has many more modes than this, however, most of
these modes simply <em>extend</em> the fundamental mode with <em>more</em> key
bindings to invoke the additional functionality.  Thus the quit
command can be invoked by the same key binding in any mode!  Another
way of putting it is that all of the finger knowledge that an Emacs
user has will probably apply regardless of what mode Emacs happens to
be in.</p>
<p>This is why Emacs, and not vi, is present in the iPhone browser.  It
allows the browser to have advanced functionality (such as moving to
the beginning or end of the address bar) without introducing a new
mode, and <em>without interfering with the simple task of inserting
characters</em>.  This ensures that users who don’t need <em>or aren’t even
aware of</em> the advanced functionality will never get stuck in a
different editing mode.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-emacs">Beyond Emacs</h2>
<p>Emacs is a wonderful editor but nowadays editors are not so important.
Most of the time we are consuming content instead of generating it.
The web browser is now the center of the software universe.  And
although browsers have a little bit of Emacs in their address bars,
the rest of their user interface has taken a big step backwards from
Emacs: their keyboard support is poor.  It’s impossible to operate
most web browsers using <em>only</em> a keyboard, without a mouse or
touchscreen.</p>
<p>There have been a few side efforts to add keyboard navigation to
popular web browsers.  <a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a> has been my
favorite, but it doesn’t seem to have much of a future, as it depends
on old, unsupported technology (XULRunner).  Of current efforts, I
like <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl">Tridactyl</a>, but it only
works with Firefox (for now), and its key bindings are inspired by vi,
not Emacs.</p>
<p>A more fundamental problem is that browser makers simply don’t care
about keyboard navigation, or at least they are incompetent about it.
Their extension capabilities are crippled and their key binding
support is too.  We may be waiting a long time for the Emacs of web
browsers.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is <strong>known to be needed</strong> in the product.</p><cite><a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog">The Scrum Guide</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Ideas do not fit that description. An idea is a “maybe this would be helpful” thing, not an “I know this is needed” thing.</p>



<p>If you have ideas for your product, that’s fantastic and fabulous and you should hang onto them. But please don’t use the backlog for that. Use a roadmap or a hierarchy or a storymap or a text file or literally anything that’s not the backlog.</p>



<p><em>When the time comes to officially plan and refine one of those ideas, that’s when you move it into the backlog. </em></p>



<p>A backlog with things in it that are not <strong>known to be needed</strong> is a backlog with waste. It’s a mountain of inventory to wade when you want to find a specific part. </p>



<p>Here are some signs that your backlog has too much stuff in it:</p>



<ul><li>You’re embarrassed to show it to people, like a messy kitchen</li><li>You start to keep a separate list of important things because you’re worried they’ll get lost and forgotten in the backlog </li><li>You get stressed out when you look at it</li><li>There are tickets from 3+ months ago</li><li>There are tickets that you had forgotten all about</li><li>There are tickets that you don’t even understand</li></ul>



<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. Keep a lean, focused backlog with only the stuff you know you will work on in the next couple cycles, and stop digging through hundreds of tickets you may never get around to starting. </p>



<p>Give yourself the focus and stress relief that comes with a backlog that is free of fluff. It’ll make it easier to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">shut up and plan the sprint</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>After I have moved from a tiny tiny apartment 9m^2 in Tokyo to a big one 3LDK (2 western-style rooms, kitchen, living/dining room, and tatami room) I decided that I am going to use one of the westerner rooms as my home office/laboratory and with this idea, a lot of project ideas appeared in my head what I could do with my home office. One of the first projects which I have already finished was getting an Air Conditioner in the home office room</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-7.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-7.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-7.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I bought two Panasonic ACs for the home office and bedroom. The living room already had an air conditioner. They are pretty small and. efficient units for 6 tatamis sized room (~9.72m^2)</p><p>As a European from North Europe Japanese spring/summer has hitten hard for an unexpected guy coming from a different continent. The weather until late May was without any issues pleasant temperatures sunny days and then <strong>THE Rainy Season</strong> came which introduced me with the new term <strong>Humidity</strong> to which I was never used or never had much concern living in Europe. When your room humidity level reaches 70-80% you would want to reduce the humidity level quickly as high humidity can introduce a lot of problems for your apartment. This is where Air Conditioner comes which helps with these issues by utilizing Dehumidifier mode which reduces humidity in the room pretty quickly.</p><p>After this unexpectedly pretty long Rainy season the real summer came up with really high temperatures as far as 35-45ºC which were devastating as my apartment was the top floor so it would heat up to around 32ºC in the home office room as soon as 8 AM. So the air conditioner was a must item in my home office!</p><p>Not to forget the winters in Tokyo can get mildly cold too, but so you know Japanese apartments in most cases lack any central heating system so you have few options to warm up urself:</p><ul><li>Electric Fan Heater (Most common device in Europe I think)</li><li>Electric Radiator</li><li>Electric Infrared Heater</li><li>Electric Blanket</li><li>Kerosine Heater</li><li>Gas Fan Heater</li><li>Gas Heater</li></ul><p>Yes I know burning stuff inside the apartment for westerners would sound crazy but most Japanese apartments there are special pipes/tubes in walls with covers for exhaust fumes, etc. same with air conditioners their special pipes for passing air conditioner refrigerant/electrical lines to the outside.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-8.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-8.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-8.png 1002w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You probably would not believe if I told you that the small square socket near the bottom big pipe is a gas outlet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>There are plenty of DevOps myths&nbsp;circulating the developers’&nbsp;community. This is no surprise, considering how much excitement the DevOps concept has brought&nbsp;over the recent years.</p>



<p>The DevOps methodology can provide significant positive effects for organizations when implemented properly. It can <strong>lower costs, boost efficiency</strong>, and <strong>make the work of development teams more streamlined</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in order to grasp the strength of this&nbsp;process, it is necessary to recognize what DevOps represents. That’s why, in this article, we address some of the most popular DevOps myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 1: DevOps is all about CI/CD&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about DevOps is that it’s the same thing as CI/CD. The truth is that continuous integration and delivery are <strong>the key components of DevOps</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>DevOps focuses on the culture and responsibility in a team. It emphasizes the need for everyone on the team to take part in each other’s tasks. This improves <strong>collaboration and communication</strong> in the team.</p>



<p>On the other hand, CI/CD enables this culture with software and tools that emphasize automation. You can see them as <strong>a means to an end</strong>.</p>



<h2>Myth 2: DevOps means NoOps</h2>



<p>NoOps describes the concept where the cloud infrastructure is so automated, that there is no need to manage it.</p>



<p>NoOps is considered as<strong> the next evolution of DevOps</strong> as a development model. Just like DevOps, its goal is to improve software delivery, but by allowing developers to focus on application development instead of infrastructure and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, you can automate the setup, deployment, and monitoring processes, getting closer to NoOps.</p>



<h2>Myth 3: Automation eliminates all bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Automation is one of the biggest benefits that DevOps provides. But <strong>it’s not a silver bullet</strong> that will solve all your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A continuous delivery process enables teams to roll out new features quickly. And, get the feedback they need really fast. This, of course, means that you have to ensure the product’s quality. Moreover, you have to take care of how well it runs and its performance when scaling. You also need to ensure smooth production deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Automating your CI/CD pipelines helps <strong>eliminate the bottlenecks between code commit and deploy.</strong> But, this is just one stage of the software delivery process. Unless developers and testers are in a partnership, you won’t be able to resolve all your problems. It’s likely that you’ll only move any bottlenecks to another stream.</p>



<h2>Myth 4: One-size-fits-all continuous delivery pipeline</h2>



<p>The idea that you can have one process that fits all teams and companies is impossible, contrary to popular belief. Every organization has <strong>different needs and requirements</strong>. Even projects in the same organization need different continuous delivery pipelines.</p>



<p>You can have projects that need only two to three environments. For example, development, test, and production environments with frequent deployments. Another project can require more environments since it has multiple stages in the software delivery cycle.</p>



<p>This is why the continuous delivery pipeline should <strong>represent the release process</strong> that the company is already using.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 5: DevOps is all about tools</h2>



<p>Conversations about DevOps are mostly focused around which tools your company is using. They then turn into philosophical battles about what are the best tools. Instead, we should be <strong>communicating about the bigger picture</strong>, the business value DevOps brings to your company.</p>



<p>DevOps means focusing on <strong>culture, mindset, and how individuals work together.</strong> Only after should you be choosing the right tools for your processes. Teams often look in the large ecosystem of tools trying to find the perfect solution at the beginnings. They build DevOps pipelines for a very long time, that should be redone once completed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:a87265a6-4a4d-4905-97e9-4129ac78563c/Atlassian%20DevOps%20Trends%20Survey%202020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlassian research</a> showed that the two main factors to implement DevOps successfully are <strong>the right tools and the right people</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>DevOps automation tools like <a href="https://microtica.com/">Microtica</a> allow you to create pipelines and test them in hours.</strong> With these kinds of tools, you can save months of work on pipelines that might not function. </p>



<h2>Myth 6: Software release is the same as in Amazon/Facebook/Google</h2>



<p>Many world-leading companies have adopted DevOps for its benefits and flexibility. Looking at these company’s success stories, we, of course, look up to their achievements. We do this without realizing their context and the steps they made to become that successful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing is for sure – these organizations <strong>chose and built the tools and processes that worked best for them at the time</strong>. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we need to follow these organizations. Moreover, what they did won’t magically work for our business as well.</p>



<p>We should learn from them and find new ways to innovate and grow. Explore and find the right processes and tools that define our problem space. What will bring <strong>success to our particular business</strong>? This is what DevOps is all about.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Myth 7: Release all the time</h2>



<p>The idea of frequent releases has companies worried about not releasing their software continuously enough. <em>“Ship often”</em> has become the industry standard. However, this doesn’t specify the time. It may be every two to three weeks, or it may be several times a day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing is that you achieve the<strong> team confidence</strong> that enables you to release new software when required. CD is the <strong>ability to release code from the main branch and feel confident in it</strong>. The idea of DevOps is that your code should be releasable anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So remember, continuous delivery doesn’t mean you should release as often as you can but gives you the ability to release <strong>as often as you want.</strong> <em>How often should be up to your company’s decision.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>Wrapping up</h2>



<p>We hope this&nbsp;article helped you bust some of the most popular DevOps myths that&nbsp;swirl around. Don’t let such misunderstandings hinder the progress of your team. Implementing DevOps can help your company improve productivity and create better products, so don’t miss out on these benefits due to these DevOps myths. </p>

<p>Distributed teams are hard. Distributed teams, where some people are in office and others at home, are harder. Widely distributed teams with people working across countries and time zones are exceptionally hard. Widely distributed teams in a pandemic are damn near impossible to get right.</p>



<p>Culture clash alone is an enormous challenge. I once had a fantastic American product manager piss off an equally strong director of engineering (in India) by complaining that the tool the PM needed “had fallen and can’t get up.” The director—and the engineers on the thread—took it as a tremendous insult, even though the product manager was trying to inject a little levity. The PM should have linked to the commercial:</p>

</p><figcaption>Apparently <a href="http://lifecall.com/">Lifecall</a> isn’t big in India.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Distance, culture, and time zone problems make communicating in remote teams hard.</p>



<p>We have spent trillions of electrons this year on how to lead remote teams, so I’ll stick to something more prosaic: communication tools.</p>



<blockquote><p>Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Zoom – the communication tools you use matter, but not as much as how your organization uses them.</p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=Slack%2C%20Jira%2C%20Microsoft%20Teams%2C%20Zoom%20-%20the%20communication%20tools%20you%20use%20matter%2C%20but%20not%20as%20much%20as%20how%20your%20organization%20uses%20them.&amp;url=https://joseph.by/2020/09/03/how-to-use-communication-tools-well-in-remote-teams/&amp;via=josephby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>Over the past twelve years I have worked in four different distributed organizations. From bootstrapped start-ups to legacy companies. I often found <strong>a lack of alignment caused by the inconsistent use of communication tools</strong>. Solving this required us to be way more intentional in how we communicate.</p>



<p>You need to, as a group, brainstorm, agree to, and communicate out norms of how different communications tools are to be used. When it works you get a written, jointly owned artifact that you can use to orient new team members and bolster the confidence of quieter team members. And when the rules are set up front, collaboratively, people are more like to follow them, and not need correction down the road (which could offend them).</p>



<h2>My List</h2>



<p>So here’s my list of communication tools and how to use them.</p>



<h3>Face to Face Meetings</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that need synchronous communications. Hard (“critical”) conversations. Generative exercises. Things that require dialog. Design meetings, planning meetings, <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08">betting tables</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Status meetings. Networking conversations. Routine discussions.</p>



<h3>Video or Audio Conferences</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that require synchronous attention but less dialog. Structured discussions. Ideally, decisions that are less contentious. Prioritization exercises, design reviews, presentations of an analysis. Collaboration where a small number of people are presenting to a larger number of people.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Energy levels. Remember, <strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/5-reasons-why-zoom-meetings-are-so-exhausting-137404">video is draining</a></strong>. Use it sparingly. Find other ways to ensure that all participants are “present” and attentive. You know your team is healthy if it is present without being threatened by the green camera LED. If numbers admit <strong>take turns, at least once, to make make sure that everyone has a chance to be heard.</strong></p>



<h3>Email</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Asynchronous, text-heavy communication. Wide distribution groups. Not time sensitive. Easy to read (no need to click away to see the content). Things that people may want to consider and respond to. Monthly status update to investors or senior leadership. Summarizes of organizational changes.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Put the most important information into the subject line and lede. Make sure your emails are easy to read on mobile devices.</p>



<h3>Phone and Text</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Getting a hold of someone after hours or while they are away from keyboard (e.g. in transit) and you need a dialog. If you need to get a hold of someone for an emergency after hours, and want a last resort before actually calling them, or don’t need an immediate synchronous response. Always text first #BecauseIts2020 .</p>



<h3>Chat</h3>



<p><strong>Patterns:</strong> Establish clear norms as to when people are / are not expected to be available on slack; use threads to allow people to follow topics. Be aware of timezones; encourage use of Away messages. <strong>Train people on how to manage their notifications, alert settings, and Do Not Disturb. </strong>Don’t assume they’ll figure it out, or will feel comfortable turning it off. <strong>Use public channels</strong>, created for topics, teams and projects. </p>



<p><strong>Anti-patterns:</strong> This is going to need a bulleted list.</p>



<ul><li>Remember that <strong>text loses tone</strong>, and that low-fidelity communication tools like chat can amplify management mistakes. Give people the benefit of the doubt when they seem clueless but <strong>do not tolerate behavior that makes people feel unsafe, particularly by those with power</strong>.</li><li><strong>Chat transcripts ≠ documentation.</strong> If you agree on a behaviour or solution to a problem then <strong>document it somewhere</strong> and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Chat messages ≠ to-dos</strong> or workflow tasks. If someone agrees to do something in slack, create a ticket in the relevant tracking tool and link to it from the conversation.</li><li><strong>Avoid using #general</strong>. Real conversations should happen in dedicated channels.</li><li><strong>Avoid using group messages:</strong> they’re hard to find, not categorized by topic, and carry and unclear expectation of privacy.</li><li><strong>Limit the use of private channels:</strong> again, they are hard to search and risky to add people to. If people only feel safe in private team channels something bigger is wrong with your organization.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, <strong>chat makes bad managers worse</strong>. The combination of immediacy, reach, lack of nuance, and lack of non-verbal feedback can encourage some incredibly stupid behaviour that can be hard to undo.</p>



<h3>Wiki</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Documentation, references, working documents; Version tracking important;  High-fidelity (fancy formatting) not important</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Things that imply sequence. Workflows, etc.</p>



<h3>Bug Tracking or Workflow Management Tools</h3>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Things that have a deadline, dependencies, multi-step tasks, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements, specs, designs – anything more than a few lines shouldn’t live in the bug, but should be linked out to a doc from the bug. Bug tracking tools are hell to search.</p>



<h3>Documents</h3>



<p>This includes Google/Word Docs, Slides/Powerpoint/Keynote and Sheets/Excel</p>



<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Narratives or analyses; work that needs a lot of formatting and high fidelity. Work that changes slowly. Read-aheads for meetings. <strong>Group editing</strong>. Google Docs still has the best commenting tools, although wikis like Confluence has come a long way.</p>



<p><strong>Bad for:</strong> Requirements. Reference documents. Documents that are expected to be maintained over a long period of time. After a project is over things like Word Documents are typically lost in a shared folder, hidden away, and never used again.</p>



<p><strong>Major </strong>🔑<strong>:</strong> Tuck documents away neatly after a project. If they are no longer being updated, add a prominent note to that effect in the top of the document, with a link to other relevant, and more recent information (i.e. a Wiki). <strong>Manage the zombies.</strong></p>



<h2>Things to remember</h2>



<p><strong>Avoid holy wars.</strong> Focus on picking the smallest number of tools that cover the greatest number of use cases, weighted by importance. <strong>Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good</strong>, but be aware of tools with high switching costs (bug tracking, chat) and be careful.</p>



<p>Remember that <strong>the process is as important as the outcome</strong>. You want to have broad support for the list so that influential team members feel ownership and will actively help to improve communication. And finally, <strong>don’t be cheap</strong>. Buy the right version of the tools and <strong>spend the money needed to get them configured and maintained property</strong>. If well paid software engineers are cutting and pasting tickets between bug tracking systems, I will find you.</p>



<p>Above all, <strong>expect change</strong>. How an organization communicates will change. Plan for it.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>In a distributed organization, leading well requires <strong>intentional communication</strong>. Intentional communication requires the effective, consistent use of digital tools. To achieve this:</p>



<ul><li>take an inventory of the communication tools in use,</li><li>crowd source and align on the specific <strong>tools you are going to use</strong> and <strong>how you’re going to use them</strong>,</li><li>write <strong>patterns</strong>, <strong>anti-patterns</strong>, and <strong>starting points</strong> for each–make norms explicit by writing them down,</li><li>share them widely, and finally,</li><li>revise them often to keep them useful.</li></ul>



<p>One last thing. Communication is good, but <strong>too much communication is not a healthy signal</strong>. People need time to think, plan and work. They should not be thrashing endlessly between Slack, Jira and Docs. So make sure that people know how to protect their time and are able to set boundaries, get work done, and feel as though they are accomplishing things.</p>

    <p>This is the guide through the observability space to assist you with planning observability of your next project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observability</strong> is ability of your system to expose data about its performance and behavior so we can further monitor, analyze and alert on certain trends or changes. Making your system observable requires certain effort in your project.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why should you care</h2>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_1.jpg"></p>

<p>Observability of your system is the <strong>top non-functional requirement</strong>. In my opinion, not even application performance tops observability. It is absolutely necessary that you know what is happening in your system at any given time and <strong>in level of detail necessary to be able to keep everything running smoothly by adequately reacting to change in te system</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, there is a possibility that you do not share this opinion, in which case you would,probably, rather develop your product, do a bit of testing, UAT and push it out. Probably because it requires certain amount of work and is considered non essential as you start. If Google Analytics is all you need, I am not here to argue that, refer back here when you change your mind. If, however, you want to dive into this topic and start planning, I want to share some insights that should help you pin down stuff that is most important for you and prioritize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are quite a few aspects of observability in service oriented architecture, and in this article I will be focusing on discussing every aspect with little bit of depth in order to help you better understand, focus and plan developing your observability. To help you plan and have a broader conversation with all the people involved in planning your project, I will provide some insight into most popular stacks as well and give insights into most important defining factors.</p>

<p>Your system being observable can mean multiple things on as many levels, but generally, it means that system exposes data that we can consume to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monitor system in real time.</li>
  <li>Alert or perform some automated task based on defined data state, or rather a change of state.</li>
  <li>Analyze and predict behaviors, requirements etc…</li>
  <li>Do a detailed analysis of the incident or any distinct event in the system.</li>
  <li>Any combination of above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since it is all about using proper tools, let’s spend some time on quick discussion about what we need and what tool/type of observability we choose.</p>

<h2 id="characterizing-capabilities">Characterizing capabilities</h2>

<p>When we talk observability of the system, way we are planning it really depends on what we want to achieve. Ultimately, we would love to achieve everything, but some ability to focus and plan would be nice. Let us take a look at some factors to take into account when prioritizing observability.</p>

<p><strong>Main types of data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Logs</strong> - Old, but gold. First that ever existed, has all the data about what is going on, but slow, hard to process and needs huge system throughput to bring usage close to real time. You can still go to the file that was generated last and grep it for particular phrase or just look for the time when error happened, which will forever be my favorite thin I ever learned how to do (apart from making pizza from scratch).</li>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong> - Quick, flexible, made for quick availability and low throughput requirement, easy and long retention. Not too much data per unit of information, real time trend analysis and reaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Traces</strong> - Everything you would like to know about call you made, seems like magic especially in well instrumented distributed system. Sometimes slower then logs, but allows for deeper analytics.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance qualities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Usability</strong> - Do metrics allow a good way to monitor and analyze them, with flexibility in data architecture to give enough versatility.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed/throughput requirements</strong> - how much metrics system can take before receiving some performance penalty. Also, how fast are the metrics available for consumption/use (both manual and automated).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Way we plan to consume data:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - real time plotting and observation of system state.</li>
  <li><strong>Alerting and automatic triggers</strong> - reacting to events by broadcasting notification or triggering events.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics</strong> - analyzing collected data to gather useful learnings about system and/or perform <strong>root cause analysis (RCA)</strong> of problem in the past (usual case) or ongoing problem (more rare since Analytics is mostly about applying complex algorithms to big data sets to draw conclusions, and that takes time).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can quickly draft a following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Performance/ Throughput needs</th>
      <th>Recommended for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Logs</td>
      <td>Medium / Medium - still lots of text</td>
      <td>RCA/Monitoring/Alerting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Metrics</td>
      <td>Fast / Low - smallest unit of data</td>
      <td>Monitoring/Alerting/Analytics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Traces</td>
      <td>Slow / High - contains lots of data</td>
      <td>RCA, Alerting in some setups</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="creating-observability">Creating observability</h2>

<p>As you are building a system, no matter if it is a huge monolithic application, or a multiservice-something, planning observability you want to achieve will get you places. For that you’ll have to know what kind of tools you need and what additional infrastructure will it take… of course, but there is also a choice of where to start. It is less obvious, but deciding to do everything might be costly decision depending on how much time you got to deliver first version of your system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>DevOps</strong> - in this moment it is worth mentioning that for most of the stuff that I write, I assume your goal is full DevOps, and that your team is building everything and running it in all the environments. If you are getting something pre built, you have army of engineers or reasonably long timelines there might be a way to get it all in time .</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Generally, you do not need to do anything in order for your system to start gathering logs, logs will be available to you anywhere from default log directory for the OS of choice to Kubernetes logs. What you will need is everything else - literally.</p>

<p>Going from just a stack of call logs inside a gazillion line file on disc to searchable log database that can also be used for certain level of alerting and many different applications is the matter of planning. I usually recommend two well known stacks, that differ in log collection segment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack">ELK</a> - Elastic, Logstash, Kibana which is more standard one</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-elasticsearch-fluentd-and-kibana-efk-logging-stack-on-kubernetes">EFK</a>- Elastic, Fluentd, Kibana which is more flexible one in terms of data flow management and further design scalability. It is also recommended for Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess everyone loves 3-letter abbreviations so nobody bothered to add F at start of both, since it became a standard. F for <a href="https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you need to setup EXK and Filebeat, Filebeat will pick up the logs as they arrive to any of mentioned standard log outputs and send them to log collector, that gets stored into Elastic database so logs will be indexed and made searchable and visualizable through Kibana.</p>

<p>Obviously, more activity you got in your system, more logs there is, more data throughput becomes crucial for your logs to get to you - Filebeat needs to send logs to Elastic that then needs to index them (on the way there is a throughput of whatever you use). I have seen cases of hundreds of terrabytes of logs a day with need of month to 3 months retention… It becomes whole separate system to maintain.</p>

<p>The good thing is that, when overwhelmed, these setups are quite good in the degrading performance but keeping data, so if you do not run out of physical hardware and everything just halts, your logs may be late to Kibana because elastic can’t index, or they might be stuck in some queue, but they will not be lost. That is, at least, something.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In the wild</strong></p>

  <p>Stack itself is relatively easy to deploy with lots of resources available online, from tutorials to docker-composed sets, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> submodules and<a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> charts to do it for you. First hard thing to do is set everything right first time from the delivery of logs perspective. Second hard thing to do is not to kill your logging stack with too much or too big logs.</p>

  <p>Good luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p><img src="https://rastko.tech/images/observability1_3.jpg"></p>

<p>On the metrics side of things are lot different then on the logs side of things - although there is general majority choice of a tool, and thus a approach to it, there are actually two different approaches based on a way metrics are exposed / collected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pull - used by wider accepted and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/cncf-prometheus-project-journey/">CNCF adopted Prometheus</a></li>
  <li>Push - used by StatsD</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on two stand out representatives of two groups, I will provide quick comparison.</p>

<h4 id="pull---prometheus">Pull - Prometheus</h4>

<p><a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is my current metrics collection stack of choice, developed by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> and fully promoted ot open source in 2015, although it was available for longer.</p>

<p>Pull means that metrics collector is scraping services that are being monitored by it. In turn, system requires that any service that needs to be monitored by Prometheus exposes metrics. Data exposition format allows “condensation” of the metrics that are exposed, so they basically can accumulate until scraped for both variable scraping intervals, but also the longer periods in case of incidents with collector.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Metrics are kept in service’s memory until collector pulls (scrapes) the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The architecture of the metrics collection and way Prometheus is built gives us two important architectural advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resilliance</strong> - If Prometheus collector dies for some time, metrics are not lost because they are kept in service’s memory until scraped</li>
  <li><strong>Federation</strong> - same way the service exposes metrics to be collected by Prometheus, Prometheus itself can expose aggregated metrics to be collected by other Prometheus system, allowing for metrics collection scaling by creating tree …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article is part of a <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expressions/">Series On Regular Expressions</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, we will discuss regular expression quantifiers with the ultimate goal of developing a very deep understanding of how they work. &nbsp;In fact, by the end of this article you'll understand quantifiers so well, that you'll be able to extend your knowledge to invent a completely new quantifier has never been seen before in any regular expression engine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this article, you will understand everything in the following diagram:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantifiers are used to quantify how many times a part of your regular expression should be repeated. &nbsp;Every time you want to repeat something in a regex (an individual character, a character class or a sub-expression) you can write a quantifier after it to specify how many times it should be repeated.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following list shows some examples of the most common quantifiers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>?</strong></li>
<li><strong>*</strong></li>
<li><strong>+</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{,N}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,}</strong></li>
<li><strong>{N,M}</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article will only discuss these quantifiers within the context of Perl-like regular expressions (<em>not</em> POSIX regular expressions). &nbsp;This is worth mentioning since the older POSIX style regular expression quantifiers lack certain features, and have significantly different behaviour in some cases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most typical guides to regular expressions would probably start by immediately diving into a detailed description of what each of these symbols does. &nbsp;They would probably start by explaining the meaning of the '*', '+', and '?' symbols. &nbsp;However, <em><strong>this won't be your typical guide to regular expressions</strong></em>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we'll start by focusing on understanding this quantifier:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this atypical approach is simple: &nbsp;Once you understand what <em>this</em> quantifier does, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;Let's do a few examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assume you need to write a regular expression that can match both spellings of the word 'enroll'. &nbsp;The word 'enroll' can sometimes be spelled with one 'l' or two 'l's depending on whether the author chooses to use British or American spelling conventions. &nbsp;Using this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll be able to match both spellings of 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a link to an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=enrol%7B1%2C2%7D">interactive visualization of the regex enrol{1,2}</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the quantifier is the '{1,2}' part. &nbsp;The '{1,2}' quantifier can be interpreted in English to mean "Whatever came just before this quantifier, repeated anywhere from 1 to 2 times.". &nbsp;If you wanted to change the regex to also match any misspellings of 'enroll' that have 3 'l's, you could just change the upper bound of the range from 2 to 3:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{1,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, using the regex above, you can match all three spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could go even further and change the regex to include misspellings that don't have any 'l's at all, by decreasing the lower bound of the range 0:</p>

<p><code><pre>enrol{0,3}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the regex above, you can match these four (miss)spellings of the word 'enroll':</p>

<ul>
	<li>enro</li>
	<li>enrol</li>
	<li>enroll</li>
	<li>enrolll</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pattern that this quantifier uses should now be a bit more obvious: &nbsp;Whenever we want specify that the previous character can be repeated a lower bound of N times up to an upper bound of M times, we can write this quantifier after the character:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the letters 'N' and 'M' here are placeholders that are used for the purposes of documentation. &nbsp;In reality, you would never literally write '{N,M}' as a quantifier in your regular expression. &nbsp;You would would write something like '{2,8}', '{0,20}' or any other pair of positive integers.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make things crystal clear, there are a few cases where the endpoints of the range are not explicitly written, but are instead implied. &nbsp;Here is an example:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of this quantifier is to repeat the character 'a' anywhere from (it doesn't matter times) to 5 times. &nbsp;Another way to describe the same thing would be to say "repeat the character 'a' anywhere from 0 times to 5 times" which you could do with the following equivalent regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll sometimes see the same thing with the upper bound of the range:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in these cases the upper end of the range is assumed to be "Infinity", however there is no equivalent way to write this explicitly. &nbsp;You simply can't write something like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{3,Infinity} (This does not work)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since most regex engines will default to interpreting the range quantifier as literal text if it doesn't see the format it expects. &nbsp;Therefore, when the upper bound of your range is 'infinity', you must simply omit the second number like this: '{3,}'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final important case to consider is when a single number is used to describe that the previous character should be matched <em>exactly</em> the number of times specified. &nbsp;For example, this regex will match any sequence of <em>exactly</em> 4 'a' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wanted to re-write this using a range, we could write:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{4,4}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which means the same thing.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the quantifiers we've reviewed so far, it should be clear that they can all be re-written in the following standardized form:</p>

<p><code><pre>{N,M}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where</p>

<ul>
	<li>'N' is a positive integer.</li>
	<li>'M' is a positive integer OR left blank to represent 'infinity'.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We still haven't discussed the meaning of the '?', '*' and '+' quantifiers, so let's do that now:</p>

<ul>
	<li>'<strong>?</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,1}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>*</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{0,}</strong>'.</li>
	<li>'<strong>+</strong>' is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntax sugar</a> for '<strong>{1,}</strong>'.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%3F&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '?' quantifier</a> that makes the character 'a' optional. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph splits into two possible paths: &nbsp;One that skips the character 'a', and one that requires it. &nbsp;If one path fails, the regular expression engine simply backtracks to try the other path.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%2B&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '+' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' one or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by requiring an 'a' character. &nbsp;If there are no 'a' characters, it fails immediately. &nbsp;If there is at least one, control will split into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path goes back to try and get yet another 'a' character, and the other continues with the rest of the regex. &nbsp;By default, the regex engine will first try the path that consumes yet another 'a' character until there are no more in the search text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a*&amp;the_subject=a">example interactive visualization showing the '*' quantifier</a> that matches the character 'a' zero or more times. &nbsp;As you can see, the control flow graph starts by splitting into two possible paths: &nbsp;One path immediately continues on with the rest of the regex, and the other attempts to consume an 'a' character. &nbsp;By default, this quantifier will first try the path that consumes an 'a' character. &nbsp;Once it fails to find another 'a' character, it will give up and continue on with the rest of the regex.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a table to summarize what we've learned so far:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Quantifier Symbol</td><td>Normalized As A Range</td><td>What It Really Means</td></tr>
		<tr><td>?</td><td>{0,1}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to 1 times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>*</td><td>{0,}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>+</td><td>{1,}</td><td>"Repeated from 1 to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N}</td><td>{N,N}</td><td>"Repeated from N to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{,N}</td><td>{0,N}</td><td>"Repeated from 0 to N times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,}</td><td>{N,}</td><td>"Repeated from N to Infinity times."</td></tr>
		<tr><td>{N,M}</td><td>{N,M}</td><td>"Repeated from N to M times."</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed previously, quantifiers can be used to specify how many times a character in your regular expression can be repeated:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you can also apply quantifiers to character classes too:</p>

<p><code><pre>[0-9]{0,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you could use this regular expression to match chapter titles in a book, regardless of how many digits are in the chapter number:</p>

<p><code><pre>[Cc]hapter [0-9]+
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And most importantly, you can also apply a quantifier to a sub-expression to repeat a sequence of characters. &nbsp;For example this regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(Hello){2,5}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHello</li>
	<li>HelloHelloHelloHello</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even apply quantifiers to a sub-expression that contains an alternation. &nbsp;This regex:</p>

<p><code><pre>(cat|dog|bird){1,2}
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will match any of the following strings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>cat</li>
	<li>dog</li>
	<li>bird</li>
	<li>catcat</li>
	<li>catdog</li>
	<li>catbird</li>
	<li>dogcat</li>
	<li>dogdog</li>
	<li>dogbird</li>
	<li>birdcat</li>
	<li>birddog</li>
	<li>birdbird</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as promised earlier, you're already 50% done learning everything there is to know about quantifiers. &nbsp;There are many more quantifiers than what we've seen so far, but fortunately, there are only 4 fundamental aspects to every regular expression quantifier, and you'll understand them all by the end of this article. &nbsp;Here are those 4 aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>1)  The minimum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>2)  The maximum number of times it can match.</strong></li>
	<li>3)  Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.</li>
	<li>4)  Whether it will disable backtracking or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you can see, we've already covered the first two, so 2/4 = 50% done.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's cover item #3 from the list above: "Whether it prefers to match as many times as possible, or as few times as possible.". &nbsp;Consider a case where we want to match this regular expression:</p>

<p><code><pre>a{2,4}(aabbcc|bb)
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against this piece of text:</p>

<p><code><pre>aaaabbcc
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can follow through the matching process with an <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/regular-expression-visualizer/?the_regex=a%7B2%2C4%7D(aabbcc%7Cbb)&amp;the_subject=aaaabbcc">interactive visualization of the matching process for this regex here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the quantifier '{2,4}' can match the 'a' anywhere from 2 times to 4 times, and the text we're searching starts with 4 consecutive 'a's, it's ok for the regular …</p></div></div></div>

<a href="https://blog.leonardofederico.com/2020/08/how-humans-unlock-social-capital.html">Picasso, Schoenberg, Moss: how humans unlock social capital</a>
</h3><p>
(See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24363273">HN thread</a> here.)</p><p>

Once every while I read something that changes my perspective on things. Usually, not because it reveals a ground-breaking truth, but because it helps me connect the dots backward. Suddenly, things are now integral parts of a larger picture and everything makes more sense.</p><p>

A year ago I read this piece from Eugene Wei: <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service" target="_blank">Status as a Service</a>.</p><p>

Eugene writes:</p><blockquote>
Why does proof of work matter for a social network? If people want to maximize social capital, why not make that as easy as possible? As with cryptocurrency, if it were so easy, it wouldn't be worth anything. Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans. Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy.</blockquote><p>
He continues:</p><blockquote>
Read Twitter today and hardly any of the tweets are the mundane life updates of its awkward pre-puberty years. We are now in late-stage performative Twitter, where nearly every tweet is hungry as hell for favorites and retweets, and everyone is a trained pundit or comedian. It's hot takes and cool proverbs all the way down. The harmless status update Twitter was a less thirsty scene but also not much of a business. Still, sometimes I miss the halcyon days when not every tweet was a thirst trap. I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye, the always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye, I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye.</blockquote><p>
Then, goes:</p><blockquote>
So, to answer an earlier question about how a new social network takes hold, let’s add this: a new Status as a Service business must devise some proof of work that depends on some actual skill to differentiate among users. If it does, then it creates, like an ICO, some new form of social capital currency of value to those users.</blockquote>
<p>
This didn't just resonate with me. It helped me understand on a deeper level how and why visual arts, aesthetics, music, and human taste in general develop.</p><p>

Let’s start from the ground up.</p><p>

In a few words, the article states that:</p><ul>
<li>Social Networks to thrive need a <i>proof of concept</i></li>
<li>Prohibitions spark human creativity in a newly formed area</li>
<li>Humans, then, leverage that creativity to attract social capital and compete against each other in the newly formed arena</li>
</ul><p>
Over a long enough timeline, all the social capital available in a certain system gets allocated.</p><p>

The more we understand a system, the more effective we are at allocating social capital in it. Hence, we need new restrictions to unlock new human creativity and feed new social capital back into the system.</p><p>

This can explain on some levels how Social Networks develops, but I wondered what else? Are there are other fields where this theory applies just as well?</p><h3>
1. Painting: Cubism</h3>
<p>
For centuries, visual arts was one of the major arenas where human intellects competed. For centuries, humans challenged each other by representing reality through mere copies of the same instance.</p><p>

And gradually, we were able to go from this..</p><p>

<img alt="La pinacoteca del deserto | Wall Street International Magazine" src="https://media.wsimag.com/attachments/b875394fe3e10f195aaf936aedab87d5379b5f93/store/fill/930/523/d201b041400d593bd503ef96371789c31f312481cfd248f0a901c5876477/Pitture-rupestri-di-Jabbaren-nominate-le-libere-donne-di-Jabbaren.jpg"></p><p>

To this:</p><p>

<img alt="Frederic Edwin Church | Biography, Art, &amp; Facts | Britannica" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/88/69588-050-87EF851C/View-Cotopaxi-oil-canvas-Frederic-Edwin-Church-1857.jpg"></p><p>

Connects the dots and see how linear was the progression in the aesthetic. Over time, humans became quite extraordinary at this exercise.</p><p>

Renaissance, impressionism, pointillism, abstract expressionism, realism, etc, were all micro-steps part of the same bigger effort: representing the reality for what it is.</p><p>

Social capital in that area was progressively getting allocated up to the point where there was no much left to. Over centuries of incremental progress, we got the point where we mastered the <i>proof of work</i>.</p><p>

So, we needed a radically new thing. A new greenfield and new proofs of concept.</p><p>

Introducing cubism.</p><p>

<img alt="Georges Braque 1882–1963 | Tate" src="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00445_9.jpg"></p><p>

Unlike any of the prior movements, cubisms challenged the fundamental rules, the basic assumptions upon which the system was constructed. Reality should be represented as<i>&nbsp;it is</i>.</p><p>

This new <i>proof of work</i> emphasized a flat, two-dimensional surface. It rejected the traditional techniques of perspective, foreshortening, modeling, chiaroscuro, etc, and refuted time-honored theories of art as the imitation of nature.</p><p>

For the first time in history, painters were not bound to copying form, texture, color, space, etc. That was too well understood. They were called to present reality in radically fragmented objects, whose several sides were seen simultaneously.</p><p>

The movement was pioneered by Braque who made the original proof of concept but it was Picasso who really extracted much of the social capital that came out of it.</p><h3>
2. Music: Dodecaphony (or Twelve-tonic technique, or Chromaticism)</h3><p>
First, Bach, the real explorer of Classic composition.</p><p>

Then Mozart, and Beethoven.</p><p>

Then Chopin, Debussy, and Ravel.</p><p>

Different styles emerged across centuries (from Baroque to Late Romantic) but the ground rules in the classical composition didn’t really change.</p><p>

Let me explain.</p><p>

In traditional Western music, tonality is a means of organizing pitch in accordance with the physics of sound. A fundamental tone — say, C in a C major scale — is central; the other pitches relate to it in a hierarchy of importance based on natural overtone relationships. So, whatever happens, the music keeps returning to that fundamental tonal mooring.</p><p>

This is such a key aspect in music because it provides a sense of arrival and rest.</p><p>

All Western classical and pop music relies on the idea that, no matter what, we'll eventually get to "home base".</p><p>

Leveraging this musical axiom, musical composition techniques that had been prepared over centuries&nbsp;made it possible in the 18th century to write music that was original and immediately appealing but also sophisticated under the surface.</p><p>

And by the end of the 18th century, a lot of low-hanging fruit was picked and much of the social capital in the system was already allocated in the hands of few. There wasn't much left to discover.</p><p>

In 19th-century composers,&nbsp;Wagner, Mahler, Debussy, originality frequently came at the cost of greater surface complexity, and a less direct, cheerful tone.</p><p>

It was clear that humans needed new ground-up rules to compete.</p><p>

Schoenberg was one of the first to realize&nbsp;that new innovation could only be unlocked by re-thinking the ground-rules. So he invented a new<a href="http:/#" target="_blank">&nbsp;compositional technique:&nbsp;</a><a href="http:/#" target="_blank">twelve-tonic.</a></p><p>

<img alt="Arnold Schoenberg : Quartetto per Archi - Analisi Musicale" src="https://www.armoniamusicale.com/wp-content/uploads/Schoenberg-quartetto.jpg"></p><p>

Shoenberg's twelve tonic technique comes with no musical tonality. All 12 pitches of the chromatic scale are sounded as often as one another in a piece of music without emphasis on any specific note. In other words, all 12 notes are thus given more or less equal importance, and the music avoids being in a key. Consequentially, there can't home base.</p><p>

It was a radically new game.</p><p>

Shoenberg's new musical arena unlocked new social capital and many of the composers of the 20th century competed on those new rules.</p><p>

Several giants explored the 12-tone technique as well: not only Stravinsky, whose move into the enemy camp shook up the world of modern music but also Messiaen and Copland.</p><p>

Looking backward, we can say the invention of the 12-tone system was arguably the most audacious and influential development in 20th-century music.</p><h3>
3. Fashion: Kate Moss</h3>
<p>
The world of the 19th century was a world in which the canons of beauty were sculptured.</p><p>

Up to the point where the whole fashion scene was dominated by the same characters: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone, etc.</p><p>

That was a solved game.</p><p>

It was in that world, that <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG10364017/Corinne-Day-the-woman-who-discovered-Kate-Moss.html" target="_blank">Corinne Day discovered a new way to represent beauty</a>.</p><p>

Not through the canonical blonde/long hair, nor the perfect-looking skin or the mesmerizing white of the teeth.</p><p>

C. Day used the cheeky expression of a 16yo suburban skinny girl named Kate Moss to show the world an entirely new idea of aesthetics.</p><p>

Way far from what were the conventions of the time.</p><p>

Not colorful, but black and white photos.<br>
Not sinuous, but skinny body forms.<br>
Not perfect-looking, but seemingly sloppy dresses.<br>
Not cheerful, but melancholic tones.</p><p>

<img alt="calvin klein kate moss Tiziano Magni kate-jam-and-diamonds •" src="https://38.media.tumblr.com/0d7209dc40fe05243c9a9ea65b3da5b1/tumblr_n22mc1djTU1r9tciko1_500.jpg"></p><p>

It was a totally different game with totally different rules.</p><p>

The effects were immediate. Existing players were&nbsp;outplayed, new social capital was unlocked, and new icons emerged.</p><p>

Moss did to Campbell, what Braque did to Manet, and what Shoenberg did to centuries of Mozart.</p><p>

Centuries of slow but incremental linear development lost in a matter of a few years.</p><p>

Visual arts, philosophy, music, and many realms get periodically rearranged according to the same principles: when there’s no more Social Capital left on the table either because it eroded over centuries or because it was consolidated in the hands of just a few winners.</p><p>

After all, we're all are status-seeking monkeys seek out the most efficient path to maximizing social capital.</p><p>

Whereas function components have been called functional stateless components (FSC) before, they are finally able to use state with React Hooks and therefore many people refer to them as function components now.</p><p>In this walkthrough, I want to explain the motivation for React Hooks, what will change in React, and how React hooks can be used in function components by showcasing common React Hooks such as the state and effect Hooks by example. This tutorial is only an introduction to React Hooks. At the end of this tutorial, you will find many more tutorials to learn about React Hooks in depth.</p><h2 id="why-react-hooks"><a href="#why-react-hooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="why react hooks permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>Why React Hooks?</h2><p>React Hooks were invented by the React team to introduce state management and side-effects in <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component">function components</a>. It's their way of making it more effortless to use only React function components without the need to refactor a React function component to a React class component for using lifecycle methods, in order to use have side-effects, or local state. React Hooks enable us to write React applications with only function components. Thus, there is no need to use class components anymore.</p><p><strong>Unnecessary Component Refactorings:</strong> Function components with React Hooks prevent unnecessary component refactorings. Previously, only React class components were used for local state management and lifecycle methods. The latter have been essential for introducing side-effects, such as listeners or data fetching, in React class components. The following shows a React class component with state management:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Component </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          Click me</span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Only if you didn't need state or lifecycle methods, React functional <em>stateless</em> components could be used. And because React function components are more lightweight (and elegant), people already used plenty of function components. This came with the drawback of refactoring components from React function components to React class components every time state or lifecycle methods were needed (and vice versa). With Hooks there is no need for this refactoring. Side-effects and state are finally available in React function components. That's why a rebranding from functional stateless components to function components would be reasonable:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>count</span><span>,</span><span> setCount</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span>You clicked </span><span>{</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span> times</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>count </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        Click me</span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> Counter</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p><strong>Side-effect Logic:</strong> In React class components, side-effects were mostly introduced in lifecycle methods (e.g. componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount). A side-effect could be <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-fetching-data">fetching data in React</a> or <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-intersection-observer-api">interacting with the Browser API</a>. Usually these side-effects came with a setup and clean up phase. For instance, if you would miss to remove your listener, you could run into <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-warning-cant-call-setstate-on-an-unmounted-component">React performance issues</a>.</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>componentWillUnmount</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>MyComponent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  React</span><span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, if you would introduce more than one of these side-effects in a React class component's lifecycle methods, all side-effects would be grouped by lifecycle method but not by side-effect. That's what React Hooks are going to change by encapsulating a side-effect in one hook whereas every hook has its own side-effect with a setup and clean up phase. You will see later in a tutorial how this works for real by adding and removing listeners in a React Hook.</p><p><strong>React's Abstraction Hell:</strong> Abstraction and thus reusability were introduced with <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-higher-order-components">Higher-Order Components</a> and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-render-props">Render Prop Components</a> in React. There is also <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-context">React's Context with its Provider and Consumer Components</a> that introduce another level of abstraction. All of these advanced patterns in React are using so called wrapping components. The implementation of the following components shouldn't be foreign to developers who are creating larger React applications:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> compose</span><span>,</span><span> withReducer </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'recompose'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> withRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> history</span><span>,</span><span> state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>ThemeContext.Consumer</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>compose</span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>  withRouter</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>withReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>App</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Sophie Alpert coined it "the wrapper hell" in React. You are not only seeing it in the implementation, but also when inspecting your components in the browser. There are dozens of wrapped components due to Render Prop Components (including Consumer components from React's Context) and Higher-Order Components. It becomes an unreadable component tree, because all the abstracted logic is covered up in other React components. The actual visible components are hard to track down in the browser's DOM. So what if these additional components were not needed because the logic is only encapsulated in functions as side-effects instead? Then you would remove all these wrapping components and flatten your component tree's structure:</p><pre><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useTheme </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'styled-components'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> useRouter </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react-router-dom'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> theme </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useTheme</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> history </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useRouter</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>,</span><span> dispatch</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>useReducer</span><span>(</span><span>reducer</span><span>,</span><span> initialState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Content</span><span> </span><span>theme</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>theme</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>...</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> App</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>That's what React Hooks are bringing on the table. All side-effects are sitting directly in the component without introducing other components as container for business logic. The container disappears and the logic just sits in React Hooks that are only functions. Even <a href="https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/commit/7867de653abbb57a49934e52622a60b433bda918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Clark left a deprecation statement in favor of React Hooks in his popular Higher-Order Component library</a>.</p><p><strong>JavaScript Class Confusion:</strong> JavaScript mixes two worlds pretty well: Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP). React introduces many developers to both worlds. On the one side, React (and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/redux-javascript">Redux</a>) introduced people to functional programming (FP) with function compositions, general programming concepts with functions (e.g. higher-order functions, JavaScript built-in methods like map, reduce, filter) and other terms such as immutability and side-effects. React itself didn't really introduce these things, because they are features of the language or the programming paradigm itself, but they are heavily used in React whereas <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements">every React developer becomes automatically a better JavaScript developer</a>.</p><p>On the other side, React uses JavaScript classes as one way to define React components. A class is only the declaration whereas the actual usage of the component is the instantiation of it. It creates a class instance whereas the <code>this</code> object of the class instance is used to interact with class methods (e.g. setState, forceUpdate, other custom class methods). However, classes come with a steeper learning curve for JavaScript/React beginners who are not coming from an OOP background. That's why class bindings, the <code>this</code> object and inheritance (<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which should be avoided anyway</a>) can be confusing.</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Counter</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  state </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onIncrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>onDecrement</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      value</span><span>:</span><span> state</span><span>.</span><span>value </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onIncrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>+</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>button</span><span> </span><span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>onDecrement</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>Now, many people argue React shouldn't take JavaScript classes away because people don't understand them.

There is one side of the group that is ecstatic about the change, and the other side that fears the change. I heard the most common concerns for React Hooks are:</p><ul><li>Everything changes! <em>Subtle panic mode ...</em></li><li>React is becoming bloated like Angular!</li><li>It's useless, classes worked fine.</li><li>It's magic!</li></ul><p>Let me address these concerns here:</p><p><strong>Everything changes:</strong> React Hooks will change how we write React applications in the future. However, at the moment, nothing changes. You can still write class components with local state and lifecycle methods and deploy advanced patterns such as Higher-Order Components or Render Prop Components. Nobody takes these learnings away from you. See how I upgraded all my open source projects from older versions to React 16.6. and none of of these projects had problems. They are using HOCs, Render Props and I believe even the old context API (correct me if am wrong). Everything I have learned all these years still works. The React team makes sure that React stays backward compatible. It will be the same with React 16.7.</p><p><span>

Now onto part two, where we check out a few more tools and libraries.</p>
<h2>Ariadne</h2>
<p><strong>Ariadne is a Python library for implementing GraphQL servers</strong> that prides itself on being schema-first. Schema-first is the approach of first defining the schema for the GraphQL service and then implementing the code by matching the definitions in the schema. The other approach is code-first where you first code the resolvers with the schema generated as an artifact. Which approach you chose is mostly up to personal preference, but let’s get back to schema-first and Ariadne and look at its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first lets both the client-side and server-side developers work at the same time since client-side developers don’t have to wait for a finished backend </li>
<li>a small and easy to learn, python based API with a focus on simplicity</li>
<li>open design, Ariadne is modular and open to customization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lighthouse</h2>
<p><strong>Lighthouse is a GraphQL framework that provides integration with Laravel (PHP) applications</strong>. It’s also schema-first and primarily uses SDL (Schema Definition Language) but also supports native PHP definitions. The idea is to take the best from both GraphQL and Laravel and combine it into a tool that makes your work much easier and provides lots of flexibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>schema-first and boilerplate free, use GraphQL SDL to describe your data and add functionality through server-side directives</li>
<li>takes full advantage of GraphQL and Laravel, build a GraphQL server on top of an existing Laravel application</li>
<li>instantly ready to use, generates optimized data queries out of the box and comes with sensible configuration defaults</li>
</ul>

<h2>GraphQL Editor</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL Editor is an all-around tool for the GraphQL schema development</strong>. The focus here is saving time and effort by visualizing schemas, creating one is as simple as joining blocks, no code required (if you prefer to create your schema the traditional way it’s still possible). This makes for a quick and easy to play with the tool, that will ease development and make communication with other team members much easier. That’s especially handy now, with everyone working via Zoom. </p>

<p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/choosing-between-rest-web-apis-and-message-streaming-8e2f4813a058" target="_blank">Capital One Tech</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When faced with a variety of options, how are developers building APIs supposed to know which is the right one for their solution? In this article, I’m going to outline the common characteristics for both REST APIs and message streaming so developers can better understand when (and when not) to use each one.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis">Characteristics of REST-Based Web APIs<a href="#characteristics-of-rest-based-web-apis" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>REST-based web APIs create a conversation between a client (the API consumer) and an API server (the backend). When we build REST-based APIs within Capital One, we use HTTP as our protocol. Our designs depend heavily on HTTP, from the methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to the headers that help us communicate between client and server (e.g. Authorization, Accept, Content-Type).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-1.webp" alt="Request/response client-server list conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 [
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  { "projectId":"...", "name":"..." },
  ...
 ]
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-2.webp" alt="Request/response client-server create conversation"></p>

<pre><code>POST/projects
Content-Type: application/json

{ "name":"...", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { "projectId":"...", "name":"...", ... }

</code></pre>

<p>The client (or API consumer) is the app, which sends a message (i.e. an HTTP request) to the API whenever it needs something. The server then replies with the response, including a status code that indicates if the request was processed successfully (2xx error code), failed due to client error (4xx error code), or failed due to server error (5xx error code). All communication flows from the consumer to the API backend.</p>

<p>When we add in hypermedia links, we extend the conversation with some additional information that may be helpful to the client:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-3.webp" alt="Request/response client-server hypermedia conversation"></p>

<pre><code>GET /projects/12345
Accept: application/json

200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
 
 { 
 "name":"...", ...,
 "_links": {
   { "self" :"/projects/1234" }, 
   { "related_projects": [
     { "4567" :"/projects/4567" }, 
     { "8901" :"/projects/8901" }, 
     { "9012" :"/projects/9012" } 
   ]}, 
   { "members": [
     { "1" :"/users/1" }, 
     { "2" :"/users/2" }, 
     { "3" :"/users/3" }, 
     { "4" :"/users/4" }, 
     { "5" :"/users/5" } 
   ]}
 }
</code></pre>

<p>REST-based APIs have a specific set of characteristics that are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request/response model</strong> — API consumers send requests to an API server and receive a response.</li>
<li><strong>Pull-based interaction</strong> — API consumers send an API request when data or functionality is required (e.g. user interface, at a pre-scheduled time).</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous</strong> — API consumers receive the response after a request is sent.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple content types</strong> — since REST APIs are built upon HTTP, responses may be JSON, XML, or other content types as necessary to support consumer needs (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Flexible interactions</strong> — Building upon the available HTTP verbs, consumers may interact with REST-based APIs through resources in a variety of ways: queries/search, creating new resources, modifying existing resources, and deleting resources. We can also build complex workflows by combining these interactions into higher-level processes.</li>
<li><strong>Caching and concurrency protocol support</strong> — HTTP has caching semantics built-in, allow for caching servers to be placed between the consumer and API server, as well as cache control of responses and eTags for concurrency control to prevent overwriting content.</li>
<li><strong>Internal and external access</strong> — REST APIs may be restricted for internal use or for external use by partners or public developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>For most solutions, offering a REST-based API is a great starting point, allowing any application or automation script to interact with your API over HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-message-streaming">Characteristics of Message Streaming<a href="#characteristics-of-message-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Unlike REST APIs, message streaming is better at providing notifications when new messages arrive. Once subscribed, the client will be notified when new messages are available:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-4.webp" alt="Event-based API subscription"></p>

<pre><code>POST /subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{ "callbackUrl":"https://my.callback/path", ... }

201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
 
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the client is subscribed to a topic, it will receive notifications when new messages are available. This may be the result of a REST API processing incoming requests from a web or mobile app, then adding messages into the message stream topic to notify anyone that is interested:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-5.webp" alt="Event-based API notifications"></p>

<pre><code>POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project created event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project archived event&gt;&gt;

POST https://my.callback/path
&lt;&lt;project updated event&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how our conversation became more interesting. We now can be notified when things change or critical business events occur; without needing to modify and redeploy the API to support a new integration that emerges in the future. This is called loose coupling, and it helps our systems be used in new ways without the originator of the messages even knowing about current and future subscribers.</p>

<p>Those familiar with message brokers will realize that this is familiar. The difference between a message broker and message streaming is that <em>message streaming allows us to revisit past messages in sequence as well</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/choosing_between_web_apis_and_message_streaming/convo-6.webp" alt="Streaming API conversation"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;&lt;request last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;retrieve and send last 12 messages from project_messages topic&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This feature is useful when we need to go aggregate values or perform a new calculation we previously didn’t realize we needed.</p>

<p>Note — we can’t filter messages or perform other aggregate queries when requesting the messages — only the client can do this after requesting the messages from the topic. REST APIs are better suited for performing ad hoc queries than message streams.</p>

<p>As you are discovering, message streaming is a different style of interaction than REST-based APIs. Additional characteristics of message streaming are summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Publish/subscribe model</strong> — Apps or APIs publish messages to a topic which may have zero, one, or many subscribers rather than a request/response model.</li>
<li><strong>Subscriber notification interaction</strong> — Apps receive notification when a new message is available, such as when data is modified or new data is available.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous</strong> — Unlike REST APIs, apps cannot use message streams to submit a request and receive a response back without complex coordination between parties.</li>
<li><strong>Single content-type</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built upon Avro, a compact binary format useful for data serialization. Unlike HTTP, Avro doesn’t support other content types (e.g. CSV, PDF).</li>
<li><strong>Replayability</strong> — At Capital One, our message streaming is built on Kafka, subscribers may revisit and replay previous messages sequentially.</li>
<li><strong>No caching or concurrency protocol support</strong> — Message streaming doesn’t offer caching semantics, cache-control, or concurrency control between publisher and subscriber.</li>
<li><strong>Internal access only</strong> — Subscribers must be internal to the organization, unlike HTTP which may be externalized to partner or public consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Message streaming offers some additional communication options that REST-based APIs do not — push-based notifications when new data or state changes occur, and the option of revisiting past messages in the stream to perform new calculations or re-execute logic that failed previously. When combined together, REST-APIs enable consuming apps to integrate easily with an HTTP API, while message streaming allow consumers to be notified of changes without needing to check with the REST API first. This can be a powerful combination that can satisfy use cases that exist today, while allowing emerging use cases to be handled in the future — all without modifying existing systems to accommodate new solutions.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>As you may have realized, choosing between a web API and message streaming isn’t difficult, as long as you understand the characteristics of each one. REST APIs are best suited to request/response interactions where the client application sends a request to the API backend over HTTP. Message streaming is best suited to notification when new data or events occur that you may want to take action upon. Just be sure to match the needs of the consumer with one or more approaches to offer a robust interface to your solution’s capabilities.</p>

<p>Unlike the millions of years it takes for most mountains on Earth to form, lunar mountains crop out near instantaneously, geologically speaking.</p>



<p>Earth’s mountains primarily form when two colliding plates of the Earth’s crust lift up volumes of rock, slowly creating an elevated landform. Over millions of years, wind, water and gravity erode these uplifted sections, wearing their surface to make the mountains we are familiar with today.</p>



<p>But the Moon has no plate tectonics, atmosphere or running water. How then does it boast mountains several kilometers high? For instance, <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/18/mount-as-high-as-everest-zeeman-mons/">Zeeman Mons</a> on the lunar farside peaks as tall as Mount Everest.</p>



<p>The answer lies in the one of the most apparent features on the Moon – craters.</p>



<p>Most lunar craters are <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/05/27/what-does-a-fresh-crater-look-like-hell/">small and bowl-shaped</a>, formed when asteroids and comets impact the surface. This shape persists for crater sizes up to about 20 kilometers. Larger craters display more complexity.</p>



<p>The force imparted on the Moon’s surface by larger asteroids and comets, especially those with high velocities, can be tremendous. In such cases, in addition to a crater being formed, the surface in and around the impact point is compressed further. This causes the crust to melt. When the melted crust can’t be compressed any further, it bounces right back up, forming a central mountain. This process is visualized in the GIF below.</p>







<p>Most lunar mountains are formed by this highly energetic process that takes a geologically negligible passage of time. The kilometer-plus high central peaks of the young, city-sized <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/03/11/glorious-aristarchus/">Aristarchus crater</a> and 86-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/15/tycho-crater/">Tycho crater</a> are fine examples.</p>

<p>Aristarchus crater was one of the candidate landing sites for the now-cancelled Apollo 17+ missions. Visiting Aristarchus or Tycho in a future surface mission will allow us to study the exposed lunar interior by the virtue of their central mountains. Craters larger than these offer two central peaks.</p>



<p>The mechanics work such that for larger crater sizes or more energetic impacts, the newly formed central peak splits into two before it can solidify. The 93-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/04/08/a-peak-inside-the-moon-with-copernicus/">Copernicus</a> and 77-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/21/y-shaped-mountains-in-king-crater/">King</a> craters respectively host two distinct peaks, each towering more than six kilometers!</p>











<p>Apart from allowing scientists to study the lunar interior, such places are key to understanding mechanics of impacts that form such features, found not just on the Moon but across the Solar System.</p>



<h3>Put a ring on it </h3>



<p>For even larger craters, the twin peaks widen into a ring of mountains, like a liquid drop causing a ripple on still water. The 312-kilometer-wide <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/06/10/the-crowned-crater-of-schrodinger/">crater of Schrödinger</a> on the Moon’s farside is a well preserved example, despite being almost four billion years old.</p>







<p>A <a href="https://earthandsolarsystem.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/new-paper-a-robotic-mission-concept-to-return-samples-from-the-schrodinger-basin/">mission to Schrödinger</a> can help solve fundamental mysteries about the Moon’s evolution, like if the Moon indeed had a global magma ocean–a hypothesis tied to <a href="https://jatan.space/apollo-moon-origin/">its origin</a>. Further, Schrödinger lies inside the Moon’s largest impact crater, the 2,500-kilometer-wide South Pole-Aitken basin. The impact that created the basin excavated deep into the lunar crust, and perhaps even the mantle. Since Schrödinger formed later, its impact could’ve penetrated deeper and uplifted more materials, offering insights–literally and figuratively–into the lunar interior.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> on Earth, linked to the extinction of dinosaurs, is also thought to have formed as a ringed crater, but wore down of its original form due to Earth’s active weathering. As such, Schrödinger offers an analog to better understand Chicxulub.</p>



<p>For crater sizes beyond 500 kilometers, you get not one but multiple rings of mountains. The 930-kilometer-wide ancient crater of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2019/01/07/outstanding-orientale-multi-ring-basin-on-the-moon/">Orientale</a> on the Moon’s farside boasts three mountain rings, most of which is preserved.</p>







<p>Missions to both Schrödinger and Orientale can tell us exactly when did large asteroids and comets excessively bombard bodies in the Solar System. This period of blistering impacts is particularly important as Earth is thought to have gotten its water during this time.</p>



<p>For some ancient craters, like Imbrium on Moon’s nearside, only parts of the outermost mountain ring are visible today. The rest of the interior has been drowned in lava, which you see as dark regions on the Moon. The prominent, arc-shaped mountain range of <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/10/08/the-mountain-range-montes-apenninus/">Montes Apenninus</a>, forming Imbrium’s southeast border, stretches 600 kilometers long.</p>







<p>Multi-ring impact basins exist on many other worlds in the Solar System, like <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/multimedia-gallery/9780640jpg">Caloris</a> on Mercury, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/space-images/20130614_g8gsrngbas01">an unnamed basin</a> on Jupiter’s moon Ganymede, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dione_-_Evander_basin.jpg">Evander</a> on Saturn’s moon Dione, and more. Jupiter’s moon Callisto boasts the largest multi-ring basin of the solar system, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_(crater)">Valhalla</a>, spanning 3800 kilometers wide.</p>







<p>The ubiquity of mountains formed by impacts across the Solar System and their consistent patterns indicate common geological mechanisms. And the Moon being so close to us presents us with an opportunity to study these fundamental processes in planetary science.</p>

<h3>Exploring the mountains</h3>



<p>Moon orbiters use remote sensing techniques to understand the composition of the lunar mountains. But to better understand the composition, structure and origin, surface missions are needed, especially sample return ones to determine precise ages. To that end, NASA had selected several of the above mentioned places as <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/leag2009/presentations/Day-2%20PM/03-35_Gruener.pdf">candidate landing sites</a> for the now cancelled Constellation program to return humans to the Moon.</p>



<p>However, sending landing and roving missions to lunar mountains is a bit of an engineering hurdle. Most surface missions of the past landed in the dark lunar plains – vast, solidified lava regions that provide a relatively uniform surface for spacecraft to land on. The rocky nature of the mountainous regions make it more difficult to safely touch down on. However, things may change with NASA’s upcoming Artemis missions.</p>



<p>The Artemis program aims to explore the lunar poles in this decade, both <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services-overview">robotically</a> and with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-names-companies-to-develop-human-landers-for-artemis-moon-missions">humans</a>. This requires developing precision landing technologies for safe descent on the challenging polar terrain, as a result also enabling surface missions to the lunar mountains. But there is a type of mountain that spacecraft can visit even with present-day technologies.</p>



<p>The Moon has experienced several distinct periods of volcanism in the last four billion years. Lava slowly oozing out of openings on the surface during such times have formed <a href="https://moontoday.jatan.space/2018/11/05/unique-volcanic-domes-of-gruithuisen/">volcanic domes</a>. These domes aren’t as tall as the impact-created mountains and have gentle slopes. China’s third Moon landing mission, Chang’e 5, launching end of 2020 is targeting the largest such lunar dome, Mons Rümker.</p>







<p>The 70-kilometer-wide Mons Rümker is thought to have formed less than two billion years ago. The Chang’e 5 mission aims to bring back samples from the dome and determine its exact age. Since scientists use the Moon to <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0401-the-lunar-chronology">calibrate the timing</a> of events across bodies in the Solar System, analysis of Chang’e 5 samples would be an invaluable addition to happenings in the geologically recent past.</p>



<p>Mountains on the Moon are a marvel that give us a peak (pun intended) into the lunar interior, help discern the chain of events in the Solar System’s evolution and improve our understanding of the physical processes that shape airless worlds everywhere.</p>

September 3, 2020 | https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.bearer.sh/api-debugging-tools/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Integrating with APIs can be challenging. Each with its own <a href="https://blog.bearer.sh/best-practices-for-navigating-api-documentation/">documentation format</a>, SDK patterns, and authentication quirks. Once you get the integration up and running, the harder step is testing and debugging any problems. This part can be exploratory—before you finish building—or as part of problem resolution.</p>
<p>While you can certainly debug within your codebase, by testing methods and reviewing logs, it can be beneficial to isolate the API calls by using one of the many API testing tools available.</p>
<p>Rather than list the pros and cons of each, let's focus on what makes each tool unique and worth trying.</p>
<h2 id="postman">Postman</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid Plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/postman.png" alt="postman"></p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Postman</a> is an institution in this space. It's been around for years, and went from a small app that made API calls into the full ecosystem that it is today. While Postman's primary use case is building and managing your own APIs, their emphasis on encouraging third-parties to publish collections has made it a great tool for exploring and debugging web services. These collections are what make Postman a fantastic tool for debugging external API calls.</p>
<p>Some providers, like Zendesk, <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/sunshine/custom_objects_api">link directly to their Postman collections</a> in their documentation. Others can be found on Postman's <a href="https://explore.postman.com/">Explore</a> page, and then opened within the Postman app. Once installed, you can explore endpoints and resources with minimal setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://postman.com/">Learn more about Postman</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hoppscotch">Hoppscotch</h2>
<p>Cost: Free</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/hoppscotch.png" alt="hoppscotch"></p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Hoppscotch</a> started as a faster, browser-first alternative to Postman, called Postwoman. It has since been rebranded and continues to add features. Its main benefits are speed and availability. It is also <a href="https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch">open source</a>, and can even run as a browser extension or progressive web app (PWA).</p>
<p><a href="https://hoppscotch.io/">Learn more about Hoppscotch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="paw">Paw</h2>
<p>Cost: Free Trial, then $49.99</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/paw.png" alt="paw"></p>
<p>Moving on to platform-specific applications, <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a> is a paid Mac application for interacting with APIs. Like many of the others, it's core focus is on providing a tool to build, test, and document your own APIs. Perhaps Paw's greatest selling point is the UI. Compared to many of the other application's on this list, it really feels like quality Mac-first software. It also offers Team functionality, and an interesting feature called Pawprint that lets you share request/response pairs via a URL, even if the receiver doesn't use Paw.</p>
<p><a href="https://paw.cloud/">Learn more about Paw</a>.</p>
<h2 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/insomnia.png" alt="insomnia"></p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> is another API client that lets you design, debug, and test APIs. Unlike some of the other "all-inclusive" applications, Insomnia splits the API designer functionality into a seperate app. This makes the UI much more approachable, and makes it easier to quickly try out a new request without excess setup and configuration.</p>
<p>One additional tool that you can find in their documentation is a CLI version called Inso. It allows you to use the functionality from both their core Insomnia client as well as the designer app, right from the command line, and even from within CI/CD environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Learn more about Insomnia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fiddler">Fiddler</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/fiddler.png" alt="fiddler"></p>
<p>While the rest of the applications in this list are centered around allowing you to directly interface with APIs, <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Fiddler</a> takes a different approach. It is more of a general purpose web debugging tool. It acts as a proxy to capture local requests between your device and the internet. This means you can run your application locally, and inspect any outgoing requests and incoming responses from the Fiddler application.</p>
<p>This approach can be useful for live-debugging, but it also allows you to mock requests and responses that match specific rules. Combined with features around creating collections of requests and responses, and the ability to collaborate with a team, this approach could really help debugging more complex API problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler">Learn more about Fiddler</a></p>

<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/http-toolkit.png" alt="http-toolkit"></p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">HTTP Toolkit</a> is another proxy-style tool like Fiddler, but it is much easier to use and allows you to target specific apps and devices. Where I had trouble getting Fiddler to recognize calls made from my terminal, HTTP Toolkit just worked immediately. The Pro plans offer some really interesting features, such as modifying calls as they are sent, simulating timeouts, and simulating connection failures. In a lot of ways, it feels like the browser's "Network" panel, but for any application.</p>
<p>There's clearly a goal of developer productivity, shown through small touches like inline documentation for status codes and headers, as well as the ability to export code for the API call itself in a variety of languages. It's also open source, which is always a nice bonus.</p>
<p><a href="https://httptoolkit.tech/">Learn more about HTTP Toolkit</a></p>
<h2 id="bearer">Bearer</h2>
<p>Cost: Free + Paid plans</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a> takes a different approach, in that it monitors APIs from within your application with minimal code changes. Any common issues are detected and collected in the dashboard, but you can also set up custom rules for edge case problems. This is a great way to actively debug, but also passively keep watch for unexpected problems that may arise with web services.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/09/bearer.png" alt="bearer"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Learn more about Bearer</a></p>

<p>Choosing the right tool, not just for the task, but also for your workflow can be a challenge. Fortunately, all of the options we've looked at here are free or offer free trials to get you started. Whether you're doing some exploratory testing, debugging a rare problem, or looking for a way to make your integrations more reliable, there's an existing API debugging and testing tool that can help.</p>

Revolver Exclusive Study: COVID-19 Lockdowns Over 10 Times More Deadly Than Pandemic Itself </p><div>

<p>A groundbreaking new study commissioned by <em>Revolver News</em> concludes that COVID-19 lockdowns are ten times more deadly than the actual COVID-19 virus in terms of years of life lost by American citizens.</p>
<p>Up until this point there had been no simple, rigorous analysis that accurately and definitively conveys the true costs of the COVID-19 lockdowns. Accordingly, <em>Revolver News</em> set out to commission a study to do precisely that: to finally quantify the net damage of the lockdowns in terms of a metric known as “life-years.” Simply put, we have drawn upon existing economic studies on the health effects of unemployment to calculate an estimate of how many years of life will have been lost due to the lockdowns in the United States, and have weighed this against an estimate of how many years of life will have been saved by the lockdowns. <strong>The results are nothing short of staggering, and suggest that the lockdowns will end up costing Americans over 10 times as many years of life as they will save from the virus itself.</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 lockdown measures that Americans have had to endure for the greater part of 2020 represent one of the most dramatic, consequential, and damaging policy measures undertaken in this nation’s history. <strong>For the first time in its history, America has experienced a situation so crippling and perilous that long term financial and social stability have been legitimately threatened.</strong></p>
<p>As with everything in 2020 America, these lockdown measures have become deeply politicized. President Trump opposes further devastating lockdowns. In his recent Republican National Convention speech, President Trump raised the point that lockdowns have had very real and very devastating effects on the lives of many Americans.</p>
<blockquote><p>President Trump: “The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. &nbsp;Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it’s a surrender to the virus.” <strong><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974">[Politico]</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Democrat Presidential candidate Joe Biden, by contrast, has suggested that he is willing to impose further lockdowns if “scientists” tell him to do so. It is unclear which scientists Joe Biden would be listening to, as there is no consensus among scientists and experts as to whether or not lockdowns are worth the staggering costs they impose on the common man.</p>

<p><em>Revolver News </em>is very proud to present a rigorous study on such an important topic and we hope that this will be spread far and wide both within government and without to assist policymakers. This exclusive study is a collaborative guest contribution to <em>Revolver News</em>. Due to the unfortunately politicized nature of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the associated plausibility of professional repercussions, the authors have chosen for the time being to represent themselves pseudonymously.</p>

<p><strong>CHEAT SHEET</strong>: <strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard approaches to evaluating epidemic policy responses, involving the <em>Value of a Statistical Life</em>, have conceptual problems and are biased towards the elderly and rich.</li>
<li>Using a life-years criterion as an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost <strong>an order of magnitude more</strong> life-years than they saved.</li>
<li>Most of the publicized cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have used coarse measures like lives as units rather than life-years, which misleads politicians and the general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately impact the oldest members of the population, whereas the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately harm the youngest of the working population, who have far greater life expectancies at the time of impact.</li>
<li>Using prior research on workforce entrants and recent graduates entering into a market marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive research on job displacement can be used to estimate the economic impact in life-years of starkly increased unemployment for mid-to-late career workers.</li>
<li><strong>Combining these analyses, we found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two different comparison groups, we estimate that the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.</strong></li>
<li>Every broad age category lost life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and older.</li>
<li>The media and state and local governments contributed to the panic by selectively presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of dubious benefit.</li>
<li>Public health researchers and health economists gave poor policy advice and made selective use of the prior research literature. They will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia for their failure because of academia’s biases.</li>
<li>Public health in general is so biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”</li>
</ul>
<p>———————————</p>
<p><strong>Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations Show COVID-19 “Cure” Is Worse Than Disease</strong></p>
<p>On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the following weeks, the countries of the world began implementing previously unthinkable measures to prevent the spread of the virus. In the United States, some states quickly locked down nearly all physical businesses, venues, and public areas. As a short quarantine rapidly grew into an indefinite lockdown, some lawmakers and economists began asking if the lockdowns would cause more damage than the virus itself. Using empirical research, first-pass estimates can be made about the impact of the unprecedented lockdown in life-years lost. This can then be compared to the number to the estimated life-years lost to COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Why life-years? It is well-known that socioeconomic status (SES) appears to be linked to life expectancy and some of that association is causal, with higher SESes causing longer life expectancies through a number of channels. Most government policy analysts make decisions using the <em>Value of a Statistical Life (VSLs) —</em> which is about $10 million. If a regulation can save 1 life and costs $9 million, for instance, then it’s worth imposing to save a life. If it costs $11 million, then it’s not worth imposing to save a life. A problem with this approach is how coarse it is. Because SES is linked to life expectancies, actions by the government that do not result in direct loss of life are liable to being simply unaccounted for in this approach. For example, why not set the VSL at $100 million? Or $1? If you set the VSL too low, you will fail to impose many very cheap lifesaving regulations.<strong> Something perhaps more subtle is that if you set the VSL too high, then regulations you impose will reduce income so much by retarding economic activity that you will wind up reducing life expectancies through the SES-life expectancy channel.</strong> There are actually more fundamental issues with the use of a single VSL for all citizens (see Sunstein’s <em>Valuing Life</em> for a good overview), but many find the general equilibrium problems with it very intuitive.</p>
<p><strong>Surprisingly, the COVID-19 conversation among public health analysts, bio-statisticians, economists, and policymakers <em>who are otherwise sensitive to the problems with VSL</em> has been dominated by the standard “coarse” VSL calculation above.</strong> We have seen no full policy analyses utilizing life-year approaches, although various studies have tried to estimate the average life-year losses per COVID-19 death. Controversy over estimating the correct value of a statistical life, problems with actually applying it in analysis as described above, and perhaps a certain odiousness associated with the rendering of human lives in dollar terms have pushed some health economists and public health analysts toward use of a life-years approach. This approach is simple, and in principle, involves no explicit conversion of human lives into money terms — although such a trade-off is implicit in any policy analysis. From the life-years’ perspective, a policymaker can compute the life-years lost and gained if they take a specific action. <strong>For instance, a new airline safety regulation may make users of airlines so safe that they save an average of 0.1 life-years per traveler, but the higher cost of air travel may induce potential passengers to switch to less safe car travel, costing the switchers an average of 0.3 life-years. If enough people switch to car travel, then the airline safety regulation will actually reduce the total life-years lived from the perspective of the transportation system as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>A life-year maximizer would say that the regulation should not be adopted. <strong>An advantage of the life-year approach is that it values all people’s life-years equally in principle. The life-year of an 80 year old is of equal value to that of a 20 year old.</strong> <strong>The …</strong></p></div></div></div>

        <p>Batteries comprise 30-40% of the upfront cost. To push electric mobility, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MORTH) of India, announced that all the states and union territories (UTs) <strong>have now been allowed the registration and sale of electric vehicles (EVs) without pre-fitted batteries</strong>.<br>
The move is likely to provide the necessary boost for the<strong> wider adoption of EVs across the country.</strong><br>
Practically, the government is striving to create an ecosystem to accelerate the uptake of electric mobility in the country. This will not only protect the environment and reduce the oil imports but also provide opportunities to the sunrise industry.<br>
What is the situation in India? According to the <a href="https://www.smev.in/"><strong>Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles</strong></a>, the sale of electric vehicles in this country increased by 20% in 2019-20, mainly driven by rising sales of two-wheelers.</p>

<article>
  

    <section>
      <p>I recently read a somehow controversial <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">article</a> on why CEOs are failing software engineers. In the article, software management theorist <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneTBond">Gene Bond</a> argues that since business-educated CEOs only learn about financial and business management, they can't understand the creative management necessary to discover and realise new works of value.</p><blockquote>"<em>New value is a function of failure, not success; and, much of software engineering is about discovering new value. So, in effect, nearly everything [they] are taught as a business major or leader is seemingly incompatible with software engineering.</em>"</blockquote><p>But what if CEOs were former software engineers? Would they still fail the software engineers they lead? Data seems to show otherwise when you know that eight of the ten <a href="https://fxssi.com/most-valuable-tech-companies">most valuable technology companies</a> have <strong>CEOs who also are engineers</strong>. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, was exposed to tech and coding at a <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1058012110947373057?s=20">young age</a>. Bill Gates, the second richest, fell in love with programming at <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Early-Days-as-a-Computer-Programmer">13 years old</a>, and Mark Zuckerberg, famously kept coding Facebook while being CEO for years. Still, the majority of software engineers think they can only become CTO and have little interest in business.</p><h3 id="top-performing-ceos-have-engineering-degrees"><strong>Top-performing CEOs have engineering degrees</strong></h3><p>Every year since 2014, the Harvard Business Review has published an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-ceo-100-2019-edition#the-best-performing-ceos-in-the-world-2019">annual ranking</a> of the best-performing CEOs in the world and, for the past three years, there have been <strong>more CEOs with engineering degrees than MBAs</strong>, including this year's number one, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang. One likely explanation for this trend is the increase of technology CEOs on the list, as the industry has seen exponential growth in recent years. But maybe there's something else.</p><p>First of all, software engineers know how to set up the right environment for fellow developers because, well, they've been there. They know what developers <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/09/07/a-field-guide-to-developers/">look for in a job</a>. It's not surprising that <strong>twelve out of the twenty tech CEOs most favoured by their </strong><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Top-CEOs-LST_KQ0,8.htm"><strong>employees</strong></a><strong> have an engineering background</strong> or coded at some point in their careers. As Stack Overflow and Trello founder Joel Sposkly <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">puts it</a>: "<em>building the company where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness or cartoon sex in video games leads to gangland-style shooting sprees</em>". After all, he did build two multi-million companies that considerably impacted the software ecosystem.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oPXEuhoN05pnwuxbStZyMOftjkpqzRkpZdIxi2KImveOn3p8CL0VOEr7OGcuXQjFr0_MsfHaGx4QJ9ps3JSHJd8TXpv7dSUypZTTqf0jURKiGppNFiGi4aXfiLGbiJ9xBZAa6UwD" alt=""><figcaption>Joel Spolsky’s formula on how to build profitable software companies</figcaption></figure><p>I also believe that having a software engineering mindset, even if self-taught, allows CEOs to manage their companies very differently than financially focused peers.</p><h3 id="approaching-business-processes-like-programming-tasks"><strong>Approaching business processes like programming tasks</strong></h3><p>While Microsoft valuation hardly moved during Steve Ballmer's fourteen years tenure as CEO, it grew over 200 % since Satya Nadella took over in 2014. The difference? Steve Ballmer was a sales-oriented business school drop-out, while Nadella is a former software engineer turned executive.<br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SCzxw685G5KsYSWFfNKU1WiU6J7yXXk1nZ-ZBMh-LpSe4gqKLKHwrLT6KCWZJl9bI2E7QHnssM1gCdMRRDVAuabgxYCNn9lQ9xLnbkSNTJ7vgMIhDM7sJecme7mGO_Wqhgxdatg4" alt=""><figcaption>Microsoft stock price under Satya Nadella - CB Insights<span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what does Nadella, and other engineers-turned-CEOs have in common? Well, suppose we take aside the ability to understand technology and have a long-term vision about it. In that case, I believe one of their key attributes is the ability to <strong>approach business processes like programming tasks</strong>.</p><p>Do you know what programmatic marketing, growth hacking and the lean startup have in common? They're all business methodologies that were created by engineers. They leverage <strong>logic and processes</strong> instead of intuition; they're <strong>data-driven</strong> and promote <strong>iterative experimentation</strong>. And, when you go beyond the buzzwords and watch the results, they're behind the wild success of tech companies like Dropbox and Slack (whose CEOs are, by the way, former developers).</p><p>Another trait of software engineers is their inclination to <strong>automate recurring and tedious tasks</strong>. As Bill Gates is known to say, "<em>I always choose a lazy person to do a hard job, because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.</em>" And software engineers are known to be lazy. So, as CEOs, they're more likely to look for scalable solutions through automation, rather than merely hiring more human beings. Some CEOs take this thinking to another level like GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij, who started the company's famous <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">handbook</a> because he didn't want to repeat himself for every batch of new hires.</p><p>What's even more interesting is when software engineers become CEOs of non-software companies. In this case, they run their firm like a software company, <strong>making software the cornerstone of their strategy</strong>, like Elon Musk with Tesla. One key component of electric automaker Tesla's success, as <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation">spotted</a> by Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer, is that "<em>it introduced a new hardware and software architecture. For example, a Tesla has more software than the average vehicle and it is integrated around a single central software architecture. Although most gas-powered cars have software too, they typically have less software and operate on a different architecture making it more challenging to imitate Tesla's ability to update software and optimise vehicle performance.</em></p><p>Last but not least, they understand like Jeff Bezos that "<em>failure and invention are inseparable twins.</em>" In his famous <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">letters to shareholders</a>, Bezos often shares that what makes Amazon successful is their ability to accept the failed experiments necessary to get to invention.</p><blockquote>“<em>Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten [...] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.</em>”</blockquote><h3 id="why-so-few-software-engineers-want-to-become-ceos"><strong>Why so few software engineers want to become CEOs</strong></h3><p>So if software engineers can become excellent CEOs, even in non-tech businesses, why so few of them make it to the top? According to a 2019 Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/10/05/new-ceo-study-the-undergraduate-degrees-and-majors-of-fortune-100-ceos/#623b360e4130">study</a>, still, 64% of F100 CEOs had a business-related undergraduate degree. I don't think it's just about software engineers' dislike for business. I believe it's also about how few of them consider the CEO position as a career choice. They're always told that if they're interested in management, the highest possible job is CTO. When hiring software engineers for a startup job, they first think they should be CTO.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt=""></figure><p>Of course, not everyone wants to start a startup, the surest way to become CEO. But with more and more tech CEOs <strong>promoted from within after technology management roles</strong>, it's a choice to consider.</p><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>CEOs with a background in financial and business management often fail to understand software engineers</li><li>Former software engineers and self-taught developers make excellent CEO</li><li>One of their key attributes is their capacity to approach business like programming</li><li>CEO is a valid career choice for software engineers and they shouldn’t be afraid to consider it if they’re attracted to the business side</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56"><strong>Why are CEOs failing software engineers?</strong></a> - &nbsp;Gene Bond</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/"><strong>Hitting the High Notes</strong></a> - Joel Spolsky</p><p>[ARTICLE] <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/lessons-from-teslas-approach-to-innovation"><strong>Lessons from Tesla’s Approach to Innovation</strong></a> - Nathan Furr and Jeff Dyer</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentBody"><p>While working on a completely different project, I started to ask myself how the <code>who</code> command was working under the hood. In the end, I thought it was a good topic for a blog post.</p><h2 id="who-is-who">Who is <code>who</code></h2><p>Let’s start with the basics. the <code>who</code> command allows you to list the users currently logged on the system.
For example, on my machine:</p><pre><code>$ who
gauthier tty2         2020-08-30 15:06 (tty2)
gauthier pts/1        2020-08-30 15:06 (tmux(1555).%0)
gauthier pts/2        2020-08-30 16:41 (tmux(1555).%6)
gauthier pts/4        2020-08-30 15:57 (tmux(1555).%3)
</code></pre><p>It tells me that I am logged on the “physical” terminal <code>tty2</code> and on three pseudo terminals. Indeed my current session of Gnome Shell is running on <code>tty2</code> and I have 3 <code>tmux</code> windows open.</p><p>But where is it getting those information? Probably from a file as everything is a file with Linux, but let’s check which one and how the data is stored there.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-reverse-engineering">A bit of reverse engineering</h2><p>In order to see what the <code>who</code> command is doing I could try to find the source code and dig into it. But I found it fun to use <code>strace</code> to check what the process was doing instead. Since we are expecting <code>who</code> to read system files, we can only focus on the <code>open</code> syscalls.</p><pre><code>$ strace who 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep open
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/var/run/utmp", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
openat(AT_FDCWD, "/etc/localtime", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
</code></pre><p>We can quickly filter what is interesting and what is not. The first files two files <code>/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, <code>/usr/lib/libc.so.6</code> are shared libraries loaded by the process, those are interesting us.</p><p>Then <code>/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive</code>, <code>/var/run/utmp</code> and <code>/etc/localtime</code> are opened. Let’s see what those files are storing.</p><p>When exploring this kind of topics, it is always interesting to first search into the man pages before starting browsing the web. The 5th section of the manual is dedicated to “file formats and conventions” and seems a good place to start.</p><h3 id="locale-archive">locale-archive</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>locale(5)</code> where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  locale  definition file contains all the information that the localedef(1) command needs to convert it into the binary locale data‐base.
</code></pre><p>The page also sends us to <code>locale(7)</code> for more explanation about those informations:</p><pre><code>A  locale is a set of language and cultural rules. These cover aspects such as language for messages, different character sets, lexico‐graphic conventions, and so on. A program needs to be able to determine its locale and act accordingly to be portable to different cultures.
</code></pre><p>So the <code>who</code> command read from this file, probably using the <code>setlocale(3)</code> function, to find out how the information should be formated and displayed.</p><p>We can actually check it:</p><pre><code>$ LC_ALL='fr_FR.utf8' who
gauthier tty2         Sep  2 11:38 (:1)
gauthier pts/1        Sep  2 12:11 (tmux(2445).%0)
gauthier pts/2        Sep  2 12:37 (tmux(2445).%1)
gauthier pts/3        Sep  2 13:04 (tmux(2445).%2)
</code></pre><p>Indeed, the date is is not formated the same way!</p><h3 id="localtime">localtime</h3><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/etc/localtime'
</code></pre><p>Sends us to <code>localtime(5)</code> which explains:</p><pre><code>The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the local system that is used by applications for presentation to the user.
</code></pre><p>Probably <code>who</code> uses this file (or uses a function that is using this file) to print timestamps (columns 4 and 5 of <code>who</code>'s output) using the correct timezone configured by the user.</p><h3 id="utmp">utmp</h3><p>Finally comes <code>/var/run/utmp</code>:</p><pre><code>$ man -wK 5 '/var/run/utmp'
/usr/share/man/man5/utmp.5.gz
</code></pre><p>Where we can read:</p><pre><code>The  utmp  file  allows  one to discover information about who is currently using the system.  There may be more users currently using the system, because not all programs use utmp logging.
</code></pre><p>Great! We found where the <code>who</code> command is getting its data. It would be nice to be able to read this file to get those data without using the <code>who</code> command. Unfortunately:</p><pre><code>The file is a sequence of utmp structures, declared as follows in &lt;utmp.h&gt; (note that this is only one of several definitions around; details depend on the version of libc):
</code></pre><p>At this point we understood what the <code>who</code> command is doing: it is reading <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, parsing the content and formating it nicely. Let’s see if we can reproduce this simple behavior.</p><h3 id="my-own-who">My own <code>who</code></h3><p>What we simply need to do is: open <code>/var/run/utmp</code>, read <code>n</code> bytes (where <code>n</code> is the size of the <code>utmp</code> structure), print the info contained in each structure, continue until we reach the end of the file. With a bit of formating, we can even make it look like the original <code>who</code> command.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;utmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

int main() {
  // set the right locale to display the information nicely
  setlocale(LC_ALL, "");

  // open the file
  FILE * file= fopen("/var/run/utmp", "rb");

  // just for safety
  if (file == NULL) {
    return 1;
  }

  // initialize the utmp structure
  struct utmp entry;

  // read the entries from the file one by one
  while (fread(&amp;entry, sizeof(struct utmp), 1, file) != 0) {
    if (entry.ut_type != USER_PROCESS)
      continue;

    // format the date (remember who uses the /etc/localtime?)
    char date[80];
    time_t raw_time = entry.ut_tv.tv_sec;
    struct tm *ts = localtime(&amp;raw_time);
    strftime(date, sizeof(date), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", ts);

    // print the output for this entry, tries to mock who's output
    printf("%-8s %-12s %s (%s)\n", entry.ut_user, entry.ut_line, date, entry.ut_host);
  }

  fclose(file);
}

                <div>
                    <p>One of the issues I discovered while playing with microk8s Kubernetes setup locally was that many services and tools like <code>Kubernetes Dashboard</code> uses HTTPS for access and I don't want to use Self-Signed SSL certificates as it would require me installing these certificates in every device I use which would be a pain in the butt. So I was on the journey finding a way to have an SSL Certificate for my internal IP addresses. This article will document my journey of getting automatic SSL certificates for my internal microk8s Kubernetes setup.</p><h2 id="ssl-certificate-for-internal-ip-address">SSL Certificate for internal IP address?</h2><p>My first question was is there a way to get an SSL certificate from Public trusted Certificate Authority after looking at many free services like Let's Encrypt and similar services don't provide certificates to IP addresses, but only to domain names.</p><p>After discovering the issue with no way to get an SSL certificate for internal IP I was looking into other options for my problem. After racking my brains for a few minutes I had a question: Could I create a DNS A record for internal IP and would it work? A quick visit to my DNS control panel adding A record to the local IP address and visiting the domain name and seeing my local IP address served website I was amazed that it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png 1212w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Discovering that I can have a domain name for internal IP working I was surprised now I had curiosity if I will be able to use service like Let's Encrypt to generate an SSL Certificate for this domain name but if I remember correctly the Let's Encrypt requires external access to verify domain name ownership. Hmm, maybe there is a way to verify domain name ownership without external access? After some digging around Let's Encrypt documentation, I found that there many ways to verify domain ownership one of them is DNS plugins which have many DNS providers to automatically verify domains by modifying DNS records using API from those providers. In my case it is DigitalOcean.</p><p>Following <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> <a href="https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a>I tried to generate a certificate for internal IP but I ran into the issue that default macOS <code>certbot</code> installation from <code>brew install certbot</code> had no <code>certbot-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin available.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>After a quick search online I found that DNS Plugins are not installed by default with <code>certbot</code>. I needed to install <code>certbox-dns-digitalocean</code> plugin using PIP</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Afterward, I was able to generate a certificate without many issues:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Applying SSL certificate to local HTTPS server I was able to get HTTPS valid response from the internal IP address using a domain name</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt=""></figure><p>Now that I know that I can generate &amp; use an SSL certificate for internal IP address just by using a domain name. Now I can try to migrate this knowledge to integrate this to microk8s local setup.</p><h2 id="integrating-let-s-encrypt-with-dns-challenge-into-microk8s-setup-using-cert-manager">Integrating Let's Encrypt with DNS challenge into microk8s setup using <code>cert-manager</code></h2><p>I am not going to describe microk8s Kubernetes setup as it is pretty straightforward compared to the plain Kubernetes setup.</p><p>The first step is to install <code>cert-manager</code> I will be using Helm to install it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now let's configure Certificate Issuer.

(I had to change kind from <code>Issuer</code> to <code>ClusterIssuer</code> because of namespace issues)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that we configured everything we should use the SSL certificate somewhere for this article I will configure microk8s ingress to allow access to <code>kubernetes-dashboard</code> via <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now after applying the resources we can check if our certificate resource was created and check if our Let's Encrypt Certificate was created too</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now that everything created we should be able to access <code>https://server.techprowd.com/dashboard</code></p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-6.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-6.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If I understood correctly the Certificate will be automatically renewed when expiration time comes up.</p><p>So that's all for this article. I hope this helped other people who had similar ideas like me when started working with Kubernetes.</p><p>P.S. I am not a professional Kubernetes engineer and everything mentioned in this article is just my assumptions and trying out practices in the local environment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>All forms of signing email are generally solving the wrong problem (a thesis)</h2>

	<p><small>August 30, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Modern email is full of forms of signed email. Personally signed
email is the old fashioned approach (and wrong), but modern email
on the Internet is laced with things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM</a>, which
have the sending system sign it to identify at least who sent it.
Unfortunately, the more I think about it, the more I feel that
signed email is generally solving the wrong problem (and if it's
solving the right one, we won't like that solution in the long run).</p>

<p>A while ago I wrote about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/EmailVsModernProtocols">why email often isn't as good as modern
protocols</a>, which is because it's what I
described as an <em>anonymous push</em> protocol. An anonymous push protocol
necessarily enables spam since it allows anyone to send you things.
Describing email as 'anonymous push' makes it sound like the anonymity
is the problem, which would make various forms of signing the
solution (including DKIM). But this isn't really what you care about
with email and requiring email to carry some strong identification
doesn't solve the problem, as we've found out with all of the spam
email that has perfectly good DKIM signatures for some random new
domain.</p>

<p>(This is a version of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/TwoSidesOfIdentity">the two sides of identity</a>.
On the Internet people can trivially have multiple identities, so
while an identity is useful to only let selected people in, it's
not useful to keep someone out.)</p>

<p>I think that what you really care about with modern communication
protocols is <em>revocable authorization</em>. With a pull protocol, you
have this directly; you tacitly revoke authorization by stopping
pulling from the place you no longer like. With a push protocol,
you can still require authorization that you grant, which lets you
revoke that granted authorization if you wish. The closest email
comes to this is having lots of customized email addresses and
carefully using a different one for each service (which Apple has
recently automated for iOS people).</p>

<p>Obviously, requiring authorization to push things to you has a
fundamental conflict with any system that's designed to let arbitrary
strangers contact you without prearrangement (which is <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/spam/FundamentalSpamProblem">the
fundamental problem of spam</a>).
Modern protocols seem to deal with this in two ways (even with
revocable authorization); they have some form of gatekeeping (in
the form of accounts or access), and then they evolve to provide
settings that let you stop or minimize the ability of arbitrary
strangers to contact you (for example, Twitter's settings around
who can send you Direct Messages).</p>

<p>(The modern user experience of things like Twitter has also evolved
to somewhat minimize the impact of strangers trying to contact you;
for example, the Twitter website separates new DMs from strangers
from DMs from people you've already interacted with. It's possible
that email clients could learn some lessons from this, for example
by splitting your inbox into 'people and places you've interacted
with before' and 'new contacts from strange people'. This would
make DKIM signatures and other email source identification useful,
apart from the bit where senders today feel free to keep changing
where they're sending from.)</p>

<p>PS: In this view, actions like blocking or muting people on Twitter
(or the social network of your choice) is a form of revoking their
tacit authorization to push things to you.</p>

<p>I regularly help pre-seed entrepreneurs identify and evaluate potential startup opportunities. The following is a set of heuristics I’ve developed and collected over the years that might of use.</p>



<p>These heuristics are just a starting point to <strong>identify interesting, unsolved problems</strong> in the world that may turn in to great startups. Entrepreneurs must still go deep on understanding their customers, the business model, have a clear answer to <a href="https://avichal.com/2017/11/27/why-now/">Why Now?</a> there is a big shift in the market, and <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">focus on identifying problems rather than generating ideas that <em>sound</em> good.</a></p>



<ol><li>Tools inside a big company — High growth companies often first experience a problem other companies will soon face and solve it internally. Bringing these tools to everyone else can work well, e.g. Asana was inspired by the Facebook internal tasks tool, Cloudera was inspired by Facebook’s internal data infrastructure. </li><li>Consumer generation shift — Think about a consumer company that started ~7 years ago. Generations shift in about 7-10 years, thus tastes evolve, and platforms shift. Thus there is an opening to acquire customers, e.g. Snapchat started 2011 while Facebook started 2004</li><li>Big company acquisitions — If a company is acquired for $5B+, consider a competitor. This may indicate product maturity, a departure of talent after earnouts, or becoming focused on profits vs. product investment. Now may be a great time to re-imaginge LinkedIn or Github</li><li>Market validation from other startups — Find a company that recently raised a series A and approach solving the problem differently. Often the first company to identify an opportunity will not win but does indicate customers have a real problem they want solved.</li><li>Revisit ideas that were too early — Look back at ideas that were hot 10 years ago because entrepreneurs have a tendency to be too early. See if any might make sense now, e.g. Instacart vs. Webvan.</li><li>Invert a successful company’s core competency — Take the core strength of a company and flip it on its head to see what a product experience may be if you did the opposite, e.g. Snapchat was based on ephemerality and Facebook based on permanence of identity, or Southwest was based on a point-to-point model with only one type of plane whereas other airlines use a hub and spoke model with multiple types of planes.</li><li>Extend consumer behaviors to businesses — Take a product used by consumers and think about how it might apply to prosumers, enterprises, and small businesses, e.g. LinkedIn vs Facebook.</li><li>Turn open source projects in to SAAS businesses — Find open source projects that are very popular and turn these in to out of the box services for enterprises, e.g. PagerDuty is like Nagios.</li><li>Compete with old world industries using software — Find an industry that is resistant to using software and build a vertically integrated version to compete with that industry, e.g. Atrium vs. law firms.</li><li>Low NPS, fragmented industries — Identify a large, a highly-fragmented industry with terrible net-promoter-score and build a modern, software-first version of their product, e.g. OpenDoor (credit to <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois">Keith Rabois</a> for this one) </li><li>Make things programmable — Take a desktop utility, move it online, and make it more powerful by making it more programmable, e.g. Airtable and Notion (similar to <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2019/01/interesting-markets-2019-edition.html">Elad Gil’s idea around devsumers</a>)</li><li>Unbundle a company — Look at the functions of modern companies and unbundle them to make them available for companies of all sizes, e.g. WeWork is the unbundled facilities group at most big companies</li><li>Look to engineers’ hobbies — Figure out where hobbyist engineers are spending their spare time and how to productize that (<a href="http://cdixon.org/2013/03/03/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years/">Chris Dixon’s idea</a>)</li><li>Understand how teens communicate — Figure out where teenagers are spending their time to see what the communication products of the next decade may be. Teens are unencumbered and very creative, so seek to understand the motivations instead of judge.</li><li>Travel and observe non-software solutions — Travel to new places to discover non-software solutions that other countries/people/markets have come up with to various problems, e.g. I was in Moscow in 2006 and people could just hail any stranger on the street to drive them somewhere like a cab. It may not have been a big leap if you saw this behavior to Uber/Lyft on your phone.</li><li>Look at behaviors in certain geographies — Smaller, homogenous culture countries (Sweden, Korea, Japan) are early adopters of many technologies. Spend time there to understand what they are doing that isn’t globally popular yet, e.g. watching other people play video games or mobile payments took off in these markets very early relative to the US.</li><li>Unbundle the government — Think about what services the government offers and how you might build a profitable business model around these, perhaps even by offering these services in a more cost-effective way back to the government, e.g. SpaceX is a private NASA, FedEx is a private postal service.</li><li>Verticalize an already successful business — Find a massively successful business such as Salesforce and target it for a vertical that is traditionally challenging to access, e.g. Veeva is a pharma industry specific CRM worth $15B+ and raised only $7M in funding.</li><li>Build something for a distribution channel — Identify a new distribution channel that would enable access to a new customer, and then think through what that customer wants that the distribution channel does not want to provide, e.g. Pinterest and Yelp built on SEO, Paypal built on eBay, YouTube embedded inside MySpace before MySpace had a video product.</li><li>Draft on a regulatory shift — Build behind a big regulatory shift to compete with large incumbents who will be slow to move and have regulatory + technical baggage, e.g. Oscar Health after Obamacare. I’m sure some companies will spin up to help people transition to a post-GDPR world.</li></ol>



<p>I’m sure there are other good heuristics to use as a starting point. If anyone sends me others, I’ll add them to my blog post as a reference for others.</p>

		<p>I love my two cats dearly and they bring a lot of joy to my life, but they also bring other things, like poop, and fur.&nbsp; When I tried to research mitigations for any of these it was 100% SEO listicles, so I’m sharing my raw data in the hopes that the next person can find something real-if-incomplete instead of a list of every automated litter box that has ever been manufactured.</p>
<p>I wrote the bulk of this in February, but then one of the cats developed dermatitis and I put it on pause until I could make sure it wasn’t caused by anything on this list. Alas, it wasn’t, she’s just allergic to my new apartment. But then I wanted to test something else, and suddenly six months had passed. So if the tenses seem weird, that’s why.</p>
<p>(Links are affiliate links when possible)</p>

<p>I screwed up choosing my new apartment (this was written before the allergy thing). I remembered to check for space to put the litter box in the bathroom, but in my joy at finding a place that allowed that at all after so many that did not,&nbsp; I forgot to check if that space was also where you stood to wash your hands. So I ended up having to put the box in the living room. I’ve done that before and didn’t want to go back to having to keep the window open year round and still smelling poop. I also didn’t love the aesthetic.&nbsp; So I set up something kind of elaborate.</p>
<h2><a href="https://kittyvent.com/products/kitty-vent">KittyVent Litter Box Ventilator</a></h2>
<p>This is a long piece of hosing with a gentle fan in it, and a plastic thingy to block off a window that has a hole for the hose to connect to (similar to what you’d use for a portable air conditioner)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2969/4434/products/IMG_0842_075fb887-2c88-400b-9bc8-3973573e3915_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1545953794" width="423" height="282"></p>
<p>The window-blocking thing works vertically but won’t stay up on its own, I had to tape it. The fan is extremely quiet, you can’t tell it’s on from more than six inches away. I’m very sure it works because the first time I noticed a smell, I found the fan had been turned off.</p>
<p>There are instructions for how to DIY this available online (e.g. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Cat-Litter-Box-Odor-Eliminator-Fan-FlowCat/">here</a>), but I just bought it and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Litterbox Holding End Table</h2>
<p>To make it less hideous, I got an end table designed to hold a litter box. Amazon is full of these, but most have only a single entrance and no ventilation. I assume these are aimed at people who haven’t thought things through. I wanted something I could connect a vent to and actually get rid of the smell. You might be able to cut a hole in one of the ventless ones to attach the hose to but I didn’t feel like bothering, so I got one with ventilation.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91iP7ZrigoL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="443" height="420"></p>
<p>I chose ecoFlex (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BM8E4KK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01BM8E4KK&amp;linkId=12a658675d21d4d4f9cad298d5ba2314">affiliate link</a>)&nbsp; because matched my it existing furniture and was the only option with both ventilation holes and a second shelf. For this, I accepted it being really much larger than it needed to be. Also the copytext said something about liquid-proof, non-smell-absorbant material, although who knows how true that is. Then I packing taped the ventilation hose to a hole in the back that wasn’t shown in the pictures, apparently intended for electric cords to automated litter boxes.</p>
<p>My cats adapted stupidly well to this- when I set up the litter box with the door open, they both used it within 10 minutes, despite their other litter box still being available. They did just as well when I closed the door.</p>
<p>Some litter does escape the table, so have a plan for that.</p>
<h2>Dog Poop Bags</h2>
<p>My weird conservation instincts push me not to empty the litter box until I can fill a bag. Otherwise I’m wasting valuable bag. So I bought a bunch of very small, very cheap bags and stored them in that shelf in the litter box end table, which is why I wanted it so much. I chose Amazon Basics Dog Poop Bags (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NABTGY2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00NABTGY2&amp;linkId=4d1641dea9b445b48539e119879ecada">affiliate link</a>) based on WireCutter’s <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-dog-poop-bags/">recommendation</a> and so far they are resoundingly fine.</p>
<h2>Dr Esley Cat Litter (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9WFY14/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07L9WFY14&amp;linkId=37e0a6f0fb2ce49f0ba47c52c36791d7">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I got this because Sweethome recommended it. I didn’t appreciate how much better it was working until a delivery screw up made me use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06ZZYMWVT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06ZZYMWVT&amp;linkId=e9f8cccc7ed36fc1765011ac565da4d4">Arm and Hammer</a> and there started to be a smell where there hadn’t been before.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html">Litter Robot 3</a></h2>
<p>This is so close to being a truly great product, but isn’t quite reliable enough to be the only litter box. It had a tendency to get stuck in an unusable position, which eventually forces the cats to go elsewhere. The drawer the poop stays in doesn’t completely contain the smell. Also the range of litter between “excess will get dumped” and “too low” is uncomfortably thin. I’d still recommend it as a second litter box to cut down on scooping, or in a populous household where there will always be someone to turn it off and on again.</p>
<h2>Two Layer Litter Mat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G67FD6W/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00G67FD6W&amp;linkId=9e1bbec26c9a003b834013f6cbb1bc7d">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BjAf-AA6L._AC_SL1000_.jpg"></p>
<p>This actually worked great at its stated purpose of catching litter the cats track out of the box, but when the cats pooped on it (say, because the litter box had been upside down for six hours), it was almost impossible to clean, especially if I caught it less than instantly. Plus it is ugly.</p>
<h2>Open Window with a Fan</h2>
<p>This was definitely better than not having an open window with a fan, but there’s no comparison between it and the vent-with-hose.</p>


<h2>Silicone Grooming Gloves (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N9KSITZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9KSITZ&amp;linkId=cf4e5b0147e03c93e42da573c5afaf32">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713JHXyZS9L._AC_SL1000_.jpg" width="356" height="321"></p>
<p>These collect a lot of hair, plus their squishiness means you can brush bony areas that would be a problem for a metal comb. The cats start purring the instant I pet them with these.</p>
<p>Downside: kind of a pain to get the hair off the glove, does not pick up 100% of the fur it loosens, so be sure to use it somewhere easy to vacuum or at least not your own lap.</p>

<h2>The Dryer</h2>
<p>Turns out dryers are reasonably good at removing cat hair if you wait long enough. Remember to clean the lint trap frequently.</p>
<h2>Reusable Lint Roller</h2>
<p>I tried two made of the same material- a paddle shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SBM761G/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07SBM761G&amp;linkId=94a8f23a77ace6722af2df51d72f696b">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Dh0-dIIwL._SL1467_.jpg" width="341" height="324"></p>
<p>and a more traditional roller shaped one (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BAGTNAQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00BAGTNAQ&amp;linkId=cb9987743b51a7b5feea72739bf6ac92">affiliate link</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VbLSzuCrL._SL1500_.jpg" width="340" height="272"></p>
<p>Of these, I found the wand shaped one easier to use, and the roller easier to clean. I prioritized use, but your mileage may vary. Also, you need to actually read the instructions on how to use it, running it back and forth like disposable lint roller just redistributes the hair.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pillow after I ran the paddle shaped one over part of it several times. I think this gives a good idea of what it’s capable of, i.e. it’s a significant improvement but doesn’t get everything.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CdwlDpVYOYR7uoDoi2G-hNc8DLvvdJcuKTEiekukqxS_Ao3h9i5dMpu5j-s6GWrwGTe-34ILa7rc-Y83frrUc5SpqWEqErREaYHV8QACkzN1Qc7ziND_ZkQ7bPRcB2J6jcr9cxcOWwBpDKwT-zVo5dalEK1QTcm5cntNpZpe213JKFvj0cH-3aSXp9gjvW_yvmj_PRXNWBOEbkCwYiz_sVkrhebNvKv48qHgcu0hq7P-cW5DGbFncCoHJYGk0hn5zUSJGTfBZycsdWoq9wwXV3fepvtl8koVwGgAZTu-eGAifmoPK1RIQurOfZd8aYCANtifgD21PKFn0UTrFUx6gJ1paCdQ2uEVuYunpuxPVALjhQddhCI74D525eMhQ2b7-pj7q74Q9s-DI1_DHsmdvxwlGAzbPKowjkgj_XCi3kcq6MgV4ApNaZvSE89ZV3dok7peQEkh3WdP6p_V5WZbTMLdxwSqrUWU2gWNgt5R9Su6mxnSad_vpkMcSmCmln5j5aLfC0hBCOPWtYBiZ20pr0x9q2atPvG6kUhElanjCNtJBYvsgewnqxSCbzqB0tcfJ3UNFuETuFCgQ_kSU_5JMMeqa2oi94i1GH2Gogjm9wMKO3iruENNYaRmHW-9ogCsfvOHPPP558lJu78AOFY3Ld2zEjEfijgu22QP1U3vxkZBFGR_fKbfkvI=w1760-h1320-no" width="340" height="255"></p>
<p>Note: inbetween writing this and publishing, the paddle brush people offered me actual money to publish a review, which I plan on taking them up on, assuming I can find the form.</p>
<h2>Shark Pet-Perfect II Handheld Vacuum (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037HHFMO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0037HHFMO&amp;linkId=4140bcc636b3132e9c69552f56ebb21e">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>Sweethome’s top handheld vacuum pick was sold out everywhere and their second is specifically called out as being bad at fur, so I selected based on Amazon reviews. As a vacuum cleaner it is Not Fucking Around- it is super powerful and sucks anything off my floors. It advertises a special whirling brush aimed specifically at pet hair, but I found it choked on soft surface I tried it on, and the bristles were better. The biggest complain on Amazon was the battery life, but I got it for spot cleaning not marathons, so it’s been fine and I appreciate not paying for a feature I don’t use.</p>
<p>All of the anti-cat-hair devices work better if I stay very on top of them. Given time, the fur works itself deeper into the fabric and nothing will work except picking it out with actual human fingers.</p>

<h2>The Furminator (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MZLNVSW/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MZLNVSW&amp;linkId=ea4961e2a9d1ed7f9540a55d8364f886">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>This is another one that was great at its official objective but failed a secret objective. It was absolutely amazing at removing fur from the cats (on areas broad and unbony enough to support the comb), and they liked it, but it left them less soft. I did not get these cats to have them at less than their maximum softness.</p>
<h2><span>Rubber Thingies You Throw in the Washer and Dryer&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71uRMoJP33L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" width="402" height="402"></p>
<p>I ran an experiment and as far as I can tell these are no better than just running an article through the dryer. Before/after photos (which I unfortunately didn’t save) didn’t show more hair being removed and the thingies are completely free of hair after many uses, which suggests to me they’re not helping much.</p>
<p>I tried wetting them and running them over a pillow case and they indeed picked up something, so I’m leaving them in my washer just in case.</p>
<p>I used LEADTEAM (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07THZ68TT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07THZ68TT&amp;linkId=8efe81ab9e97d47fa558f5f04ff3d1f9">affiliate link</a>) and didn’t test any others, they looked identical.</p>
<h2>Wool Dryer Balls (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S0U2NVG/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00S0U2NVG&amp;linkId=6ab6affdfd3d806f607cc564889f6bbf">affiliate link</a>)</h2>

<p>Testing the dryer inserts is difficult because it’s really hard to get a control group. I can’t put in half a blanket and see what the other half does. I can’t even use my two identical blankets, because they’re not guaranteed to have identical amounts of hair on them. I tried with socks but was kind of out of patience by that point. I was pretty confident the rubber ones were doing nothing, but despite a really silly amount of rigor involving photos and test swabs with the lint roller, I just can’t tell with these.</p>
<h2>Disposable Lint Rollers</h2>
<p>These were better than nothing but not as good as the reusable roller.</p>

<p>My cats were never great at eating but had gotten to the point where between the two of them someone was vomiting almost every day without cause (cause = “I went too long without eating”, “I ate too fast because I went too long without eating” and hairballs), and one had lost a noticeable amount of weight (her current weight would be fine if she’d started there, but losing almost 20% of her body weight for no known reason is concerning). There was also behavior that made me think they didn’t like their food- things like persistently begging and then when I put new food down, sniffing it, looking upset and begging more. So I talked to the vet.</p>
<h2>Prescription Food and/or B12 vitamins (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MWKYP86/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=acesoundergla-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MWKYP86&amp;linkId=8707696381553f9939f9fdf6dda878ff">affiliate link</a>)</h2>
<p>I started both of these at the same time and now the cats are down to vomiting once a week, tops, some of which is for cause. They don’t love the prescription food by they will eat it. They’re fine with the vitamins.</p>
<p>In terms of specific brands:</p>
<ul>
<li>They hate <a href="https://www.royalcanin.com/us/cats/products/vet-products/feline-selected-protein-adult-pd-canned-cat-food">Royal Canin Duck and Pea protein</a>. When I included this in their diet they ate only two cans of food per day (one Royal Canin, one of their old food, Friskies), which is little enough that the already-underweight one was losing …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
		
<p>In this article, we’ll take a closer look at daemons. We’ll understand exactly what they are, how they’re implemented, and the scope of their responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>



<p>Simply put, a daemon (pronounced dee-mon) is an intentionally orphaned background process. Additionally, daemons are detached from the terminal in which they’re spawned, operate without user interaction, and are descendants of the system’s init process.</p>



<p>Daemons will silently wait in the background for specific events to occur or conditions to be met before executing.</p>



<p>At boot time, Linux will start the init process (init is itself a daemon) which will serve as the parent of all processes and assign it PID 1 (process identification number). It’s important to mention that the init function is a special process that is not attached to any terminal.</p>



<p>After the boot sequence is complete, Linux will start up any previously declared daemons. These will be created through a series of fork() and exit() commands which will intentionally create an orphaned process that will eventually be adopted by the init process – more on this soon.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Cases</strong></h2>



<p>Conventionally, daemon process names end with the letter “d”. If you’re interested in seeing all daemons installed on your Linux machine, use this command:</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<p>You’ve certainly encountered daemons whether you were aware of them or not:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>A web server is simply a process that runs continuously in the background waiting to process and respond to HTTP requests (http daemon)</li><li>sshd is the dameon responsible for SSH operations</li><li>“MAILURE_DEMON” is a daemon that notifies the sender of invalid email recipients&nbsp;</li><li>Monitoring hardware activity like hard drive health&nbsp;</li><li>cron jobs</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll take a look at the code to create a daemon shortly, but let’s establish some basics first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Calling the fork() function creates a new process referred to as the child process. The child process runs in parallel with the process that triggered the fork() (the parent process).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A child process shares the same program counter and CPU registers as its parent. So, when a new child process is created, both the child and parent processes will execute the next instruction after the fork() call in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a simple example from Michigan Tech:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q9blfMxaFBFWjoLw_h9HxBAJYRhW5WO6ws4atHZKsY-6Bf5y9bu-EBQJ7qJ8F_piFCvK6wct0U-l9ykXRpt1DZZy_XdJZRCjnjx7WNjLpQu8sx59rsdAxQ25y-PGCJdGJ_VvpzwL" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>After fork(), both the parent and the child processes execute the following code in parallel.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OeO_ztEonrxuE5Lw-N_7YS-3gOl0G0h8lQHUdax3632W6aooeiDSf7wOBIGU1aqyF_yCs6hnHv1IqJxtreeTsS_mkdukzMqcfbw2wPp_eEisclimHbtDUC45tetfvxQ_moeOVIvb" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>You can also make their execution paths differ if desired. If the fork() call succeeds, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, and 0 is returned in the child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a daemon, we’ll fork() to create a child process and then exit() the parent. This, as previously mentioned, will purposefully create an orphaned process that will be adopted by init. </p>



<p>Our new daemon is now free to sit silently in the background outside of any terminal and perform its task.</p>



<p>While this is a practical understanding, the actual implementation is a bit more nuanced. </p>



<p>We’ll need to make sure to do the following:</p>



<ul><li>Close all open file descriptors</li><li>Change the working directory</li><li>Separate from the terminal and ignore I/O signals</li><li>Disassociate from the process group and control terminal</li><li>Don’t reacquire a control terminal </li><li>Reset the file access creation mask</li></ul>



<p>The following implementation is inspired by Pascal Werkl’s work. I’ve added additional documentation to make it more approachable for someone that is unfamiliar with C and/or Linux systems. I encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/pasce/daemon-skeleton-linux-c/">checkout the original code here</a>.</p>







<h2>Understanding the double fork()</h2>



<p>Let’s try and understand why we need 2 fork() calls in the code above.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we run this program in the terminal, several environmental settings – specifically the shell we’re working in – are replicated to our child process. So, we’ll need to disassociate our daemon from its spawning terminal.</p>



<p>That’s why we call <code>setsid()</code> and create our own independent session for the child process. </p>



<p>However, in doing so, this child process will be in its own session and process group and therefore it’ll be its own session leader. The main takeaway here is that there is potential for the session leader to reacquire a terminal later on (i..e. if say the user were to open up another terminal). </p>



<p>We don’t want that. Remember, we want to be completely independent of the terminal and any user-input.</p>



<p>By calling fork() a second time, we ensure that this new process (fork-2) will have a PID outside the bounds of fork-1’s session. Since we are not calling <code>setsid()</code> on the fork-2 process, no new session is being made. In other words, we know that fork-2 is <em><strong>not</strong></em> a session leader and therefore there’s no risk of it acquiring a terminal in the future. </p>



<p>Finally, by killing fork-2’s parent, we know that we’ve created an orphaned process that is adopted by init and can’t reacquire a terminal or be affected by user input.</p>



<blockquote><p>TLDR: The 2 fork() calls removes any chance of the daemon reacquiring a controlling terminal and helps ensure that the daemon is re-parented onto init. </p><p>If the use of the secondary fork() isn’t clear, don’t worry – it’s more to do with handling a potential edge case in the environment than a necessity in a generic daemon implementation.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks for checking out this article! If you have any topic requests, please contact me or leave a comment below!</p>



<p>If you’re interested in seeing all installed daemons on your machine, use this command on Linux machines:&nbsp;</p>



<p><code>service --status-all</code></p>



<blockquote><p>Remember daemon names generally end in “d”</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>â€˜Just a second. I just need to respond to this one thing,â€™ I said to my daughter, as I attended to my iPhone.</p>
<p>Only much later could I count the mistakes in that statement. No, it wouldnâ€™t take â€˜just a secondâ€™; no, I didnâ€™t â€˜needâ€™ to respond to the email â€“ Iâ€™m an author and researcher, and thus rarely receive messages that have a drop-everything-and-answer urgency to them. And no, it wouldnâ€™t be â€˜one thingâ€™. My brain would be too tempted, Iâ€™d feast on it all.</p>
<p>After I finished, I looked up and my daughter was gone. The worst part: before I became distracted, we had been playing a lovely game, telling each other what superpower we most wished for. It could have brought us closer together, but Iâ€™d just blown the spirit and substance of it big-time.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a parent in the 21st century, I bet youâ€™ve experienced your own version of this. But itâ€™s not just parents, itâ€™s all of us in our interactions with each other. Distraction has become the norm. Weâ€™re blessed with pocket-sized supercomputers that connect us to anyone and everyone, and a buffet of information. But thereâ€™s a dark side: those same gadgets distract us, often at the moments that matter most.</p>
<p>Of course, smartphones didnâ€™t invent distraction â€“ theyâ€™re just the latest culprit. Before that, we blamed television. And before that, it was the telephone, or comic books, or the radio. Go back more than 2,000 years, and Socrates was even criticising the written word, for causing â€˜forgetfulness in the learnersâ€™ soulsâ€™.</p>
<p>Still, our present feels different, with the sources of distraction seeming greater in number and more ubiquitous. One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013916514539755">study</a> in 2014 showed that when two people are talking, the mere presence of a smartphone resting on a table is enough to change the character of their conversation. Thatâ€™s a tame example. To see the seriousness of the problem, look at the sobering <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving">statistics</a> on â€˜distracted drivingâ€™ in the United States.</p>
<p>After I abandoned my daughter and our game for an utterly inconsequential email, I realised I needed to deal with my distraction problem. First, I tried a popular approach: I blamed technology and made a serious attempt at a â€˜digital detoxâ€™. I bought a flip phone, subscribed to a print newspaper, and even purchased a 1990s-era word processor without an internet connection. I convinced myself that, once I banished all the technology from my life, Iâ€™d become the disciplined writer and focused father Iâ€™d always strived to be.</p>
<p>Talk about a rude awakening. Sitting at my ancient word processor, my eyes began to peer over to my now-tantalising bookshelf. â€˜Hmmm,â€™ I said to myself, â€˜I really should take a glance at this bookâ€™. Iâ€™d justify the distraction as necessary for â€˜researchâ€™. And if it wasnâ€™t reading, then Iâ€™d find something else â€“ the laundry that <em>needed</em> to be folded right now, my desk that <em>needed</em> to be tidied-up this minute. The technology wasnâ€™t distracting me. <em>I</em> was distracting me.</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s when I started a five-year journey to understand <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/distractions/">distraction</a>, its causes and its cures. I discovered a great deal that I found surprising and counterintuitive, and I developed methods to deal with my distraction that actually worked â€“ and didnâ€™t involve me trying to turn back time and operate a flip phone. I realised that distraction often begins from within, not without, and found that the fix came from identifying and managing the psychological discomfort that leads us off track.</p>
<p>As often as not, distraction is your brain ducking challenging feelings such as boredom, loneliness, insecurity, fatigue and uncertainty. These are the internal triggers â€“ the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/kids-video-game-obsession/">root causes</a> â€“ that prompt you to find the comfort of distraction and open a browser tab, Twitter or email, instead of focusing on the matter at hand. Once you identify these internal triggers, you can decide to respond in a more advantageous manner. You wonâ€™t always be able to control how you feel â€“ but you can learn to control how you react to the way you feel. A trigger that once sent you to Twitter can perhaps lead instead to 10 deep breaths.</p>
<p>Distraction, in other words, is a symptom of a problem â€“ not the problem itself. Those deeper and systemic reasons â€“ such as an inability to cope with fear, anxiety or stress â€“ deserve our concern, because itâ€™s only when we start to address them that we can make real progress. When we begin to understand what weâ€™re trying to avoid by clicking over to Twitter or checking the news for the 10th time today, we can begin to address the issue itself, and not medicate it through more distraction. We also begin to appreciate how habitual the act of avoiding discomfort via distraction can be, and how much itâ€™s become a part of how we work and live.</p>
<p>The good news is that thereâ€™s something paradoxical about discomfort: itâ€™s actually the best tool we have for evolving and developing as a species. Feeling bad isnâ€™t actually bad; itâ€™s what helped us survive. Writing in 2001, the American psychologist Roy Baumeister and his colleagues <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-70020-001">observed</a>: â€˜If satisfaction and pleasure were permanent, there might be little incentive to continue seeking further benefits or advances.â€™ If we didnâ€™t feel bad, in other words, weâ€™d never achieve good.</p>
<p>Once you understand the depth of distraction, you can start to manage it and improve. After years of experiments, I found myself less distracted â€“ a quality that improved nearly every aspect of my life. It turns out that being able to focus on the subjects and people in my life who matter improved everything from my health to my happiness to my productivity. That can seem obvious, but I couldnâ€™t have fully appreciated the joys of living an indistractable life if I hadnâ€™t gotten there on my own after a five-year journey. Being indistractable can lead you to not just change your life for the better, but also experience life fully.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Self-explore</strong></p>
<p>Identifying the triggers that made you feel bad in the first place requires self-exploration. When you notice yourself feeling distracted, pause and ask yourself what youâ€™re feeling. Are you worried? Are you afraid? Then go one step deeper. What caused the sensation? How does it feel in your body?</p>
<p>In exploring my own internal triggers, I began to appreciate that my anxiety about a project, which might lead me to find a tempting Wikipedia rabbit hole, was actually adaptive: the fact that I was anxious was good because it meant I was trying to become better. It was sometimes even as easy as saying to myself: â€˜Youâ€™re getting distracted right now because youâ€™re worried this wonâ€™t be up to snuff. Thatâ€™s okay. It means youâ€™re trying to do your best work, and thatâ€™s something to feel good about.â€™ It seems like a simple mental trick, but even that thought can have a profound influence in keeping you on track.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s an interesting paradox about internal triggers: they can be big, imposing, powerful issues, and yet the fixes can sometimes be easy and quick. Hereâ€™s an example: letâ€™s say that an internal trigger when youâ€™re about to get started on a looming project is boredom. You just canâ€™t bring yourself to get excited about doing your taxes. And because you get bored, you get distracted. But if you know youâ€™re going to get bored, you can find ways to avoid the distraction that will soothe the boredom. For instance, if you set a time limit to work on the otherwise mind-numbing task that is so short, you wonâ€™t have a chance to get bored. Anyone can work on their taxes for just 10 minutes. This is called the <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/strange-sex-habits-of-silicon-valley/">10-minute rule</a>, and itâ€™s an effective way to avoid distractions of all sorts. The point is to anticipate the internal trigger and then intercept it with a new routine rather than allowing yourself to slink away into doing something you didnâ€™t intend to do.</p>
<p>In the case of my interaction with my daughter, the internal trigger might have been anxiety about work or <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (on an email). But I can address both of those proactively, so that they donâ€™t interfere with precious daddy-daughter time. In the case of my work anxiety, I could make sure that someone on my team is monitoring incoming messages. I could put up an â€˜out of officeâ€™ email that encourages people to call me if thereâ€™s really an emergency. Or in reality, I could get comfortable with the discomfort that I might indeed be missing out on something, but thatâ€™s all right too. Any one of those is a better and more constructive response to the internal trigger than being distracted.</p>
<p>Whatever approach you take to address your inner triggers, itâ€™s encouraging to note that merely recognising uncomfortable feelings and identifying them could be beneficial. For instance, in a smoking-cessation <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376871611002535?via%3Dihub">study</a>, researchers found that participants who learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit smoking at double the rates of those in the American Lung Associationâ€™s best-performing cessation programme. Just identifying and investigating a craving had a tremendous impact.</p>
<p><strong>Reframe</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve identified the triggers, you can reframe the task at hand. Sure, you might be â€˜forced to do your taxesâ€™. But another way of thinking about that is that you â€˜get to review last yearâ€™s business successesâ€™. It sounds laughable, but it works. When I hit rough patches mid-book writing, I would say: â€˜I get to share this with my audience,â€™ as opposed to: â€˜I really have to work on the book today.â€™</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one strategy: I found the fun in whatever I was doing. Yes, I know, this is where you roll your eyes, but hear me out. I learned to stay focused on the tedious work of writing books by looking for and finding the mystery embedded in my work. I wasnâ€™t â€˜writingâ€™, I was â€˜exploringâ€™. I wasnâ€™t Ernest Hemingway; I was Scooby-Doo. Research indicates that even the simple act of thinking of something that you donâ€™t enjoy as …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So The Register managed to incite a lot of discussion with a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/">headline</a>
that plain-text e-mail is a barrier to entry for kernel development. While
attention grabbing, this is actually not a new debate. Like a lot of tech
arguments this one seems to come up on a cyclical basis. Maybe because
maintainer summit didn’t happen this year it needed to come out elsewhere.
I gave a few thoughts on twitter but this topic really deserves a longer
look at the problem and what e-mail being a barrier really means.</p>

<p>Linux celebrated over <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/commit-1-million-the-history-of-the-linux-kernel/">one million commits</a>
recently. The Linux Foundation also came out with a report about the
<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/08/download-the-2020-linux-kernel-history-report/">history</a>
of kernel development. All of this work was completed with development being
done over e-mail. Clearly e-mail has been a successful method of development
for the past 29 years by many metrics.</p>

<p>So if it’s so successful why consider changing? Part of the answer to this
question lies in not what was accomplished by using e-mail but what was <em>not</em>
accomplished because e-mail was the preferred method of development. I
marked 10 years of being a full-time software professional a few weeks ago.
This was a recent enough time span that I can still remember enough of what
it was like to get started. There were a lot of steps to make sure your
e-mail setup was correct (i.e. plain text and no weird footers). It was a
little tricky but certainly doable. This is where the split comes in: what’s
‘a little tricky’ for one person may prevent someone else from contributing
at all. I was fortunate to have enough general working knowledge of Linux to
debug <code>git-send-email</code> when it didn’t work as well as having a corporate
setup that could actually send plain text e-mail. Google around for how to
set up <code>git-send-email</code> and you’ll see this is a step many people struggle with.</p>

<p>“But if you can’t even set up e-mail should you really be working on the
kernel?” This is unfortunately a common refrain in this discussion. I’d
turn the question on its head: why is setting up e-mail a core skill for
working on the kernel? There’s a lot of value in learning and following
community norms but what value does <em>that</em> particular norm bring? I’d argue
that showing you can set up and use plain text e-mail does not make you
a better kernel programmer. Supporting tooling for a project is important
but there’s nothing inherent to e-mail that makes it a good indicator of
anything. People can only handle keeping track of so many things at once.
Having to figure out plain text e-mail is one more task on the stack.
Reducing the overhead in mental load to participation lets people focus
much more on the actual kernel work. We can maintain tools that take less
work to run. Yes, the initial SMTP configuration is a one time setup but
sending out a patch each time with <code>git-send-email</code> involves a lot of manual
steps. Even if you get the manual steps right there’s always the chance
that your e-mail will be rejected due to over zealous spam filtering. There
was a three month period or so where all my e-mails to a particular maintainer
were being rejected because my 3rd party SMTP server had ended up on a spam
blocklist.</p>

<p>“But you can automate e-mail to do the manual parts” To some degree yes but
this is hard to do across the entire tree. The kernel has very few unifying
standards so for those who work across multiple areas you’re usually left
making a best educated guess about where things should go. MAINTAINERS is a
good start but it’s not always complete. And even if you <em>can</em> automate
everything expecting every contributor to come up with their own automation
is not a good use of time. “So provide everyone the automation” and there in
lies the problem: the fact that everyone can use their own setup is seen
as an advantage so it’s impossible to give something that works for everyone.
Even trying to guess what would be the most common setup to give some baseline
hasn’t been a fruitful conversation.</p>

<p>“So GitHub is the answer to our problems?” I’m not saying that either.
“kids these days are using GitHub so we should switch too” is a very weak
argument. Familiarity with a tool is a factor but it shouldn’t be the biggest
factor. Everyone, new and experienced developers, can learn new tools. If I
thought that e-mail was a suitable tool I would be promoting it as something
newer developers should learn. Compare that with git which both new and
experienced people will tell you can be difficult to use. It <em>is</em> worthwhile
to learn git though and there’s been some improvement in UX recently
(<code>git switch</code>). One objection to GitHub is the fact that it’s a proprietary
platform. I’m not willing to entertain conspiracy theories about GitHub
being owned by Microsoft and therefore wanting to destroy the Linux kernel
but before committing to any cloud platform it’s important to do due diligence.
Part of the concern about the ‘forge’ nature of GitHub is that it ends
up being an single point of failure. Anyone who has tried to get work done
when its down will know what a pain this is. The issue is that despite the
fact that git is a distributed version control system you end up needing
to host your repositories <em>somewhere</em> for pull requests to be useful. Anything
that’s useful is going to end up being popular so you’re going to end up
with more points of failure. “What if we all just hosted our own git trees”
running infrastructure takes time, energy, and money, it’s really nice to
not have to think about things like that.</p>

<p>“But e-mail is so much better for discussion and patch review” it’s hard
to differentiate sometimes between “better because I’m more familiar with it”
and “better because it has features I care about”. Is the experience of
reviewing code in GitHub identical to reviewing code in e-mail? No. The
steps are different. It’s never going to match 1-to-1. Do I think code
review in GitHub is usable? Absolutely. Would I take GitHub review over
e-mail? Unclear mostly because it’s hard for me to separate everything else
I hate about e-mail patches from the review part. One nice advantage of
GitHub is that it is incredibly easy to jump in on threads without having
subscribed to the thread first. <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lists.html">lore.kernel.org</a>
has improved the experience of replying via e-mail significantly by providing
instructions and download links but it’s not as easy as point and click.
lore.kernel.org has also improved the archiving experience significantly
which was another area of concern with e-mail. Even with a proper archiving
system, discussion is still disconnected from both bug reporting and the
code review with e-mail. E-mail is really a lousy bug reporting system
simply because it’s easy for things to get lost. “You can filter e-mail”
yes, if you know what to filter on. Again, everyone having bespoke artisinal
e-mail filters doesn’t actually solve the problem. Having a distinct
separation between bug reports and new code is much easier to keep straight.
I also grow weary of having to explain to new contributors that LKML is
mostly just an archive and sending anything to LKML without another cc is
probably not going to get a response (a great way to discourage contributors).
Again, there is documentation out there to explain how to contribute but it
doesn’t actually <em>need</em> to be this complicated.</p>

<p>“GitHub could never scale to the volume of the Linux Kernel” This is an
interesting point. There was some discussion on twitter about monorepos.
The kernel does appear to be unique in terms of number of contributors and
volume of commits. Maybe GitHub can’t actually scale. That shouldn’t mean
the only option ever is e-mail. Git itself came out of a need for a version
control system that matched what the kernel needed (we’ll ignore other
parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper">BitKeeper</a> saga).
The scaling issue often comes up when discussing CI. Those outside the
kernel community are somewhat shocked and appalled about how much manual
work happens. <a href="https://staging.kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a> has come a long
way in integrating CI as part of the regular development process. It’s not
clear if a traditional CI system like GitHub offers would even make sense.
For one, testing kernels requires either physical machines to test on or
a virtual environment, neither of which are particularly standard for setups
like GitHub. The kernel is also (intentionally) designed to work on an
incredibly wide variety of hardware. Testing every commit against all
possible hardware is next to impossible. Even choosing a limited set of hardware
can quickly create a bottleneck for getting anything merged. KernelCI has
done a great job trying to balance coverage and speed. Part of the issue
with the scaling argument is that it’s a bit of chicken and egg to determine
if something like GitHub would actually scale. We can’t switch over because
we are concerned it might not scale but we can’t really know if it scales
until we switch over. The kernel likes small incremental changes but switching
development workflows may be impossible to do incrementally.</p>

<p>Plain text e-mail may not be the biggest barrier for many people wanting
to do kernel development but it can still be one. There are plenty of reasons
to want something better than e-mail for development. There may be some
reasons to stay on e-mail because no better tool exists but “lowering the
bar” or other gatekeeping nonsense is not among the reasons. I personally
eagerly await the day I don’t have to think about e-mailing patches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most anticipated general public neurotech events of the year happened last Friday: Neuralink’s second yearly update. Although last week was a particularly eventful one for neuroscience, with major announcements from multiple key players in the field, Elon Musk commands a level of attention unlike anyone else (warranted or not). So today we’ll focus on Neuralink and the technology they unveiled.
</p><p>
<b>The Neuralink system</b><br>
The system Neuralink presented during Friday's event is an evolution of the system they unveiled a year ago. Instead of implanting a single array of rigid electrodes into the brain, as is more common, their system inserts individual threads using a device reminiscent of a sewing machine. Indeed, a significant share of their efforts has been geared towards building a medical robot (i.e. the sewing machine) capable of quickly and precisely inserting the soft and flexible electrode threads into the brain. Individual threads are then connected to a custom chip that filters and compresses the recorded neural data, before sending it out through a low energy Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. A single chip can connect to around fifty to a hundred threads, each with multiple independent contacts, for a total of a thousand individual recording (and stimulation) sites. One of the major changes in the newly unveiled “second generation” device is that the entire system fits inside a capsule about the diameter of a quarter dollar coin, albeit five times thicker (2.3cm in diameter and 0.8cm thick). This package is meant to replace the piece of skull removed during surgery. In other words, a coin-sized hole is drilled into the skull, the electrodes are inserted into the brain using a robotic sewing machine, and then the hole in the bone is plugged with the device rather than the removed piece of skull. This allows for an elegant implant with limited wiring and no transcutaneous connectors. Of note, the surgical robot has also been significantly streamlined and improved, presumably moving it closer to something that could be used in an operating room and on humans. However, details were scarce, making it hard to evaluate any of these changes accurately. The short version is that the technology was very much in line with what had been shown last year, only improved, as can be expected of a company iterating towards a commercial product.
</p><p>
<b>A presentation light on details</b><br>
After their presentation last year, Neuralink received considerable backlash from the scientific community for excessive hype and failing to recognise similar existing technologies. While hype was still available in spades this year, there was in my view an effort to somewhat scale down ambitions. For example, Neuralink’s mission was stated in much more concrete terms this year: "The purpose of Neuralink is to solve important brain and spine problems." While there had certainly been talk of neurological disorders last year too, they had been overshadowed by very aspirational and futuristic mission statements within the first 5 minutes of the talk, including the distant idea of healthy people using brain interfaces to "achieve a symbiosis with artificial intelligence”. These ideas still made it onto the stage this year, but only later in the event during the speculative part of the Q&amp;A session. Similarly, engineering efforts have been refocused and concretised. Last year’s plan of implanting 4000 channels in their first human participant appears to have been scaled down to a single 1024 channel device. This brings them much closer to the roughly 250 channels currently implanted in human participants enrolled in research studies, including at the University of Pittsburgh where I currently work.
</p><p>
While some neuroscientists are allergic to the hype and the grandiose statements Elon Musk is known for, it’s important to remember that Neuralink isn’t a research lab—it's a Silicon Valley startup. Their event had over a hundred thousand live streamers (despite being the middle of the night in Europe), and the video has since amassed over 2 million views. That’s a big reach—this was no scientific conference talk. A startup’s CEO needs to straddle the line between realistic short term goals and an overarching mesmerising vision to recruit talent and raise money. It’s the same duality that leads to sharing images of towns on Mars (perhaps even with a human-made atmosphere) all while building the world’s most advanced rockets. In Neuralink’s case, there is the added ethical danger of presenting treatments that clearly won't exist for decades, raising false hopes in people afflicted by neurological disorders. However, by offering no explicit timelines or plans, Neuralink is making no promises, only engaging in long term speculation. The same way we can trust people not to sell their homes in preparation for a move to Mars, we should trust them not to take dramatic health decisions based on 20 minutes of sci-fi thought experiments and speculation.
</p><p>
Neuralink’s scientific and engineering merits ought to be judged on the systems it produces, not its storytelling. That is what I will try to do here. Since there is  simply not enough information to make a thorough evaluation—educated guesses will have to do.
</p><p>
<b>Neuralink’s strength is not science, it’s engineering</b><br>
Despite the aforementioned lack of details, a few laudable achievements were on display at Friday's event. The biggest was a demonstration that Neuralink's new device (Neuralink’s Neuralink?) works in vivo (in pigs), and did so for two months. The ability to wirelessly stream from 1024 cortical channels in a freely behaving animal is a big step in the right direction and a demonstration of what money and a talented team can deliver. The same is true of another extremely well-funded neurotechnology startup: Kernel, as <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/thoughts_on_kernel_announcement"> I discussed after their last announcement</a>. In both cases, the real breakthrough is the ability to take existing prototypes from research labs and integrate them into a well designed and engineered product. The robot and implantable system Neuralink showcased are more polished than anything currently available, even if none of the individual ideas or components is completely novel. At the end of the day, execution is what matters. The history of technology is littered with examples of companies successfully combining existing ideas and prototypes into compelling  products and popularising them (e.g. Apple’s first successful point and click user interface, which borrowed from Xerox's PARC in-house prototypes).
</p><p>
<b>The biggest challenges still lie ahead</b><br>
While the engineering progress is impressive, where Neuralink still needs to do some convincing is on the science. What we have seen so far is excellent execution of things we knew could be done (miniaturisation, wireless system, surgical robot, etc). The next steps for Neuralink will increasingly involve tackling unsolved scientific challenges, which are an entirely different flavour of problem. Science is much harder to rush, it's less amenable to a startup’s timeline. For instance, Neuralink currently uses thin-film based electrodes, which have yet to demonstrate long term viability in academic labs (where they are extensively studied and have been for some time). Thin films have interesting properties such as very small sizes, high mechanical flexibility, and well-established fabrication processes, which make them well suited for brain implants. But their long term stability remains a looming challenge. So far Neuralink has demonstrated their electrodes can work for 2 months in pigs. That’s a long shot from showing they can work for five or ten years in humans. As Matt Angle, the CEO of another high profile neurotech startup called Paradromics, recently put it: “if you want to test whether something can last 10 years, you really have to wait 10 years.”
</p><p>
The other big challenge is what to do with a thousand channels once they are implanted and stable. Many of the applications mentioned in the presentation are plausible and actively researched (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899314015674">stimulation of visual cortex to restore sight</a>, <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/361/361ra141?__hstc=12316075.07430159d50a3c91e72c280a7921bf0d.1525132800142.1525132800143.1525132800144.1&amp;__hssc=12316075.1.1525132800145&amp;__hsfp=1773666937">stimulation of the somatosensory cortex to restore touch</a>, etc). But each of these is an active area of research full of unanswered questions. Having a thousand channels instead of a few hundred will not significantly change the game. For instance, we know that electrically stimulating any of these sensory areas can elicit corresponding percepts (e.g. localised flashes of light when stimulating the visual cortex). But these sensations are often crude replicas of their natural counterparts, with limited spatial resolution, unnatural qualities and limited dynamic range. While one can extrapolate from these results and imagine a future where improved artificial sensations become practical and useful, it will take a lot more than increasing the number of available channels by one or even two orders of magnitude. 
</p><p>
Talking only about stimulation is perhaps a little unfair, since it's the less advanced side of the neural interface coin. Recording information from the brain is much better understood, especially for motor areas, as illustrated by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/12/1/016011/meta">this study</a> from the University of Pittsburgh where a brain implant is used to control a robot with 10 degrees of freedom. Neuralink's first demonstration will likely be to help a paralysed person control a computer with their mind, or perhaps even a robotic device of some kind (this second one is less likely because of the added complexity). Concretely, a system like this could allow the user to interact with a computer by controlling a cursor (i.e. point and click) and input text (either by using a virtual keyboard, or perhaps a more cutting-edge approach like the one I discussed in <a href="https://edoardodanna.ch/article/brain_calligraphy">a recent post</a>). On top of that, the user could control a few additional virtual “buttons”. In other words, the first Neuralink product could be a virtual brain-steered controller, with a joystick, three or four buttons and a speech …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<p>Dynamic, functional programming languages like Clojure are sometimes considered “slower” than their statically-typed and/or OO counterparts, due to facilities like dynamic function dispatch and immutable-orientation, etc. But this comparison is too general. </p>



<p>Clojure is <em>readily</em> optimizable in cases where utmost performance is key. Clojure embraces the “Get it working, then make it fast” approach to building up a software system—even large-scale systems with high performance demands<a href="#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">¹</a>.</p>



<p>This post is about micro-optimizing Clojure code: how can we improve our Clojure code performance on the JVM when we need it the most, when hot code paths and tight loops prevail—for example, in large-scale data processing systems.</p>



<p>General JVM performance, benchmarking, and tuning is a broad and deep skillset and there are many more considerations beyond Clojure. The focus here is Clojure-specific.</p>

<p>Before we get to our specific list of Clojure optimizations, we should emphasize that running your own benchmark and profiling experiments is essential to producing specific top-level performance outcomes for your own code and domain.</p>



<p>You could follow all of the advice in this post, shower your code with type hints, remove laziness and sequences, etc, etc, and⁠ without a <em>specific</em> performance model for where your costs are coming from and how to measure improvement, it is possible or even likely to see no dip in your processing latencies or reduction in your cloud bill<a href="#footnotes">²</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend the following tools for performing your own analyses; these were all used in developing this post:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">criterium</a> A benchmarking tool that is a Clojure industry-standard at this point; most of the relative benchmarks in this post are generated from the REPL using criterium.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-goes-fast/clj-async-profiler">clj-async-profiler</a> For minimal quick and dirty Clojure profiling. REPL-enabled.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/gtrak/no.disassemble">no.disassemble</a> For inspecting Clojure-compiled byte code from the REPL. (If you’re familiar with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javap.html">javap</a>, the output is what you would see from decompiling classes using javap -c on the command-line, except you can see what a compiled Clojure function looks like.)</li><li><a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">jmh</a> (Java Microbenchmark Harness) A feature-rich benchmarking toolkit for the JVM. Its usage is heavily Java/annotation-based (so not REPL-friendly) but it has an expressive feature set, making it possible to run more specialized<a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java"> </a>benchmarks such as <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/4a420afe8a9e/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_30_Interrupts.java">ones</a> that could deadlock (and many others; see <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/">here</a>.) We find it essential in carrying out a comprehensive benchmarking analyses and we’ll demonstrate out how to use it with Clojure a bit later on.</li></ul>



<h2 id="avoiding-laziness">Avoiding Laziness</h2>



<p>Clojure’s sequence abstraction and laziness are powerful programming facilities but we must shy away from these tools when memory and compute are in high demand. </p>



<p>Why? Lazy implementations require generating&nbsp;<em>per-element&nbsp;</em>state and this can be substantial overhead when compared to non-lazy alternatives like arrays and vectors whose elements each contribute just their own value’s size to memory.</p>



<p>Accordingly there is computation overhead in laziness due to this per element construction; compare lazy implementations of map and filter to transform values in a vector with a non-lazy (<a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers">transducer</a>-based) alternative:</p>

<p>into has first-class transducer support; the same over-<em>2x</em> gains follow when using transducers + transduce in favor of laziness + reduce.</p>



<p>Avoid laziness where scale matters.</p>



<h2 id="first-and-last">first and last</h2>



<p>This one is particularly frustrating. We might expect <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/first">first</a> and <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last">last</a> to have special consideration of their provided type. But this is not the case; they are implemented over Clojure’s lazy sequence API without respect of type. Even with a vector, last will obtain the result using a full linear pass over the data. Both first and last <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/seq">seq</a> the input unnecessarily which is additional computation cost.</p>



<p>Of course we have a way out⁠—but the moral of the story is to stay well away from first and last when optimal performance is required. Here’s a full sequence of benchmarks; notice the dramatic relative cost of first and last on vectors. Pick the latencies you like the best:</p>

<p>Edit: Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/peek">peek</a> will answer the last item of a vector optimally.

<h2 id="equiv-equals">equiv and equals</h2>



<p>An occasional need in high-performing applications is a read-heavy, in-memory cache or value registry, commonly with some kind of composite/tuple for its map keys. It turns out that the choice of datatype (for both map and key) are… erm… key here.</p>



<p>Consider the following benchmarks for a simple map lookup using different combinations of map type (Clojure’s PersistentHashMap vs. Java’s HashMap) and composite key type.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>PersistentHashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>167 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>95 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>78 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>116 ns</td></tr><tr><td>HashMap</td><td>[“a” “b”]</td><td>36 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(ArrayList. [“a” “b”])</td><td>53 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>“a:b”</td><td>33 ns</td></tr><tr><td>“</td><td>(→CacheKey “a” “b”)</td><td>152 ns</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Benchmarks for (get map key) for different map and key types. CacheKey is a basic defrecord type; “a:b” is a simple String with the composite values concatenated, etc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is quite a lot of variation in performance: JDK’s HashMap performs significantly better (except when using a record key—we’ll look at that one later). What accounts for this? </p>



<p>Clojure defines <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/equality">equality</a> (i.e., clojure.core/=) more generically than Java’s .equals and this definition is used by Clojure’s data structures for equality comparison, PersistentHashMap in this case:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>v <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span> v2 <span>[</span><span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>=</span> v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 91.347726 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>report<span>-</span>result<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span><span>.</span>equals v v2<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.741904 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Significant performance difference for these composite (vector) keys.</p>



<p>Of course, Clojure’s = is more general than Java .equals, which is a stricter comparison in several cases; here is just one example:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>.</span>equals <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ false<br>
<span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>(</span>int <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>2</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><br>
⇒ true</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>So we need to be sure that the keys we use in our map are carefully constructed to always compare correctly with the stronger .equals semantics.</p>



<p>Lastly, using a defrecord (CacheKey) appears to offer the worst performance. Let’s use some lightweight profiling to understand what is going on here, by comparing records vs vectors as keys:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><br>

Map lookup using a vector tuple as the key.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From our profiling, the map equality used by the CacheKey record looks suspicious. We can confirm its performance is much worse than vector equals:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>ka <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span> kb <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>

<span>;; Execution time mean : 11.376671 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>The performance overhead we’ve discussed here is minimal for map lookups of singular values like keywords; we are generally okay to stick to Clojure datatypes for data entities where these key types are idiomatic. Still, using records (defrecord) for data entities can have a significant twofactor impact on key lookups:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br></p></td><td><p><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>(</span>→CacheKey <span>"a"</span> <span>"b"</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : &nbsp;5.638519 ns</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span>k <span>{</span>:<span>a</span> <span>"a"</span> :<span>b</span> <span>"b"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>quick<span>-</span>benchmark<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>(</span>:<span>a</span> k<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>
<span>;; Execution time mean : 10.495481 ns</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>To make a broader generalization to wrap up this section, the JDK ecosystem at large has battled-hardened collection and data structure offerings for high performance use cases and Clojure’s Java interop (with type hints!) gives us access to any of these that make sense for our code hot spots.</p>



<h2 id="dynamic-vars">Dynamic Vars vs. ThreadLocal</h2>



<p>Another occasional need is for a per-thread state mechanism. Clojure has dynamic vars and binding, but the Clojure implementation of reading a dynamic var is far less optimal than using a ThreadLocal directly:</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>^</span>:<span>dynamic</span> <span>*</span>dyna<span>-</span>state<span>*</span> nil<span>)</span><br>

        <p>When developing a website, the web security part of the site is often forgotten or not the most crucial consideration. But in today’s society where everyone is on the internet surfing and sharing their personal information everywhere. Web security should be considered the number one priority.</p>
<p>To make a more secure web a list of the most common web vulnerbiliteis exsists. The Open Web Application Security Project helps you discover vulnerabilities and preventing them.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-open-web-application-security-project">What is The Open Web Application Security Project</h2>
<p>In September 2001, Mark Curphey started a non-profit organisation called The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), OWASP was a spin-off of the “webappsec” mailing list (Huseby, 2004). OWASP goal was to document and share knowledge and tools on web application security to help developers secure their web application against common security flaws. OWASP’s core values are to be open, innovative, global and have Integrity in the community (OWASP, n.d. B). All of the content from OWASP is freely and easily accessible from the OWASP website(OWASP, n.d. B).</p>
<p>OWASP provides many types of tools for testing the security of web applications, for example, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). ZAP is an open-source project that can help to find security vulnerabilities automatically. OWASP also provides lists of the top security vulnerabilities that exist on the web, the most known List from OWASP is the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. They also provide a Top 10 API vulnerabilities list.</p>
<p>OWASP top 10 Web Application Security Risks is a list of the top 10 security concerns that is a common threat to web applications in the last few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). This report is updated by a team of security expert from all over the world every few years (Cloudflare, n.d. A). OWASP claims on their site that implementing the OWASP top 10 is the most effective step toward changing the development culture in an organisation to produce more secure code (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p><strong>This OWASP list is from the top 10 from 2017</strong></p>

<p>Stuttard (2011) claims in his book “The web application hacker’s handbook” that every web site he have tested between 2007 and 2011 was vulnerable to some of these. As high as 94% was susceptible to XSS, 78% had Sensitive Data Exposure, 62% had broken authentication, and 32% was vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3 id="1-injectionhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a1-injectionhtml">1. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection.html">Injection</a></h3>
<p>Injection vulnerability is the number one biggest problem on the web; injection is when untrusted data is sent via a form or other data submission, and then this data goes to a code interpreter. The most know injection form is SQL injection, SQL injection happens when someone sends specially crafted data to a format that expects a plaintext string to send through a SQL quarry to evaluate to return the desired data (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>To prevent Injection attacks, all input on a site must be validating the input and rejecting suspicious data and then sanitisation of the data by cleaning it for symbols that could potentially lead to injections (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="2-broken-authenticationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a2-broken_authentication">2. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A2-Broken_Authentication">Broken Authentication</a></h3>
<p>Login and authentication system that is implemented incorrectly could potentially have critical vulnerabilities that make it possible to gain access to someone else’s account and potentially compromise the whole system via an admin account (OWASP, n.d. A). Some example of broken authentication could be credential stuffing attack which means automatic injecting username/password pairs from earlier web site breaches (OWASP, n.d. C). The username/password pair list is then automatically entered into the site to check if one hacked account from another site is the same on other websites.</p>
<p>To reduce the attack factor for authentication vulnerabilities, a 2-factor authenticator should be implemented as it limits the ways that an attacker could access the system (Cloudflare, n.d. A). The authentication system should also be limited to how many times someone can try to login with the use of rate-limiting.</p>
<h3 id="3-sensitive-data-exposurehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a3-sensitive_data_exposure">3. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure">Sensitive Data Exposure</a></h3>
<p>A web application that exposes sensitive information either via not adequately protected API’s and websites. The data can be stolen either by just being exposed without proper authentication or via a man in the middle attack (MITM). MITM is when someone is listening in on the traffic that is exchanged via a client and a server (Cloudflare, n.d. B).</p>
<p>To minimise the data exposure, all data that contains sensitive information must be encrypted both when the data is in rest and when in transit, and the web application should only store essential sensitive data.</p>
<h3 id="4-xml-external-entities-xeehttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a4-xml_external_entities_xxe">4. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE)">XML External Entities (XEE)</a></h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a human and machine-readable markup language. The XML is processed by an XML parser if the parser is poorly configured, the input can reference external entities like a file URI and then sending the data to an attacker.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity and many security vulnerabilities that exist in XML parsers, XML should be phased out with a more straightforward data format or patch the XML parser and turn off the external entities.</p>
<h3 id="5-broken-access-controlhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a5-broken_access_control">5. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control">Broken Access Control</a></h3>
<p>An access control system should enforce what a user is allowed to do on a system, when this is not adequately enforced, or the system is broken, users can have access to data and functions that they should not be able to access (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Broken Access Control can be secured by using Authorisation tokens on the web application (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Authorisation tokens is a token that is sent with each request to check that the request comes from the right person. The token should be checked for each request for what it is allowed to do.</p>
<h3 id="6-security-misconfigurationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a6-security_misconfiguration">6. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration">Security Misconfiguration</a></h3>
<p>Misconfiguration is when a system is not configured correctly, incomplete or by using default configuration that leads to displaying verbose error messages, that can contain sensitive data either about users or about the system which could lead to revealing vulnerabilities in the application (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Misconfiguration can be mitigated by removing unused code from the code base and make the configuration less complicated and also check that the production code is not giving out debug messages and making error messages more general (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="7-cross-site-scripting-xsshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a7-cross-site_scripting_xss">7. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)">Cross-site Scripting (XSS)</a></h3>
<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when untrusted data is displayed on a webpage without the data being properly validated and sanitised (OWASP, n.d. A). XSS can occur when an input filed without proper validation and sanitising is saved and then return to the site again, like a comment on a forum. XSS can create HTML object on the site and even run untrusted JavaScript code in the client browser, which can lead to session hijacking, defacing the site or redirect the user to a malicious site which looks like the original site.</p>
<p>Like Injection, XSS vulnerabilities can be mitigated by validating and sanitise every input fields that users can write content (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Every HTTP request also needs to escape all data that is sent via URLs. Modern web development frameworks often provide build-in cross-site scripting protection (Cloudflare, n.d. A).</p>
<h3 id="8-insecure-deserialisationhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a8-insecure_deserialization">8. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization">Insecure Deserialisation</a></h3>
<p>Serialisation is a concept of taking one object and turning it into a format that is more fitting to other tasks, like storing it on disk or in a database or for sending the data over a network (OWASP, n.d. A). Deserialisation is when a serialised object is converted back to its original form that can be easier for software to work with (OWASP, n.d. A). When deserialisation is not done correctly, it can lead to remote code execution, replay attacks, injection attacks and even privilege escalation attacks.</p>
<p>Deserialisation vulnerabilities are not easy to mitigate. However, there are some ways of preventing it from happening, like implementing strong type checking and monitoring the deserialisation process (Cloudflare, n.d. A). However, the only way to be sure that it is not exploited is to not deserialisation untrusted data streams.</p>
<h3 id="9-using-components-with-known-vulnerabilitieshttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a9-using_components_with_known_vulnerabilities">9. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</a></h3>
<p>Modern Web applications today are not coded 100% at the company, external components and libraries are often used to make the process faster to build as it helps the developer reduce to code needed to be written (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Some example libraries are the widely used front-end framework like Angular.js and Vue.js or backend frameworks like express.js. Thousands of websites are built on top of these frameworks, and often have multiple different types of libraries. If a vulnerability is found in a library that is popular potentially, several hundred thousand webpages are vulnerable to exploit (OWASP, n.d. A).</p>
<p>Update all library often with the latest security fixes and stay up-to-date on what libraries that have vulnerabilities in them (Cloudflare, n.d. A). Go over the web application often and reconsider every single library used and remove libraries that are not used or not actively maintained.</p>
<h3 id="10-insufficient-logging-and-monitoringhttpsowasporgwww-project-top-tenowasp_top_ten_2017top_10-2017_a10-insufficient_logging252526monitoring">10. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A10-Insufficient_Logging%252526Monitoring">Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>A data breach on average take up to 200 days from the attack happened to it get discovered (Cloudflare, n.d. A), which gives an attacker a lot of time to find the data they want and take over other systems on the network. When it is discovered the logs can be erased or not be complete enough even to investigate what happened.</p>
<p>Logs need to be stored multiple places, and on remote servers, the logging service needs to be an append-only database mode so no one can overwrite the logs that exist (Cloudflare, n.d. A),. There should be integrity control on every record that is written, so no log files can be tampered with. Every action taken on the site needs to be logged, access …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>GPT-3 has become famous overnight through viral posts on social networks. Between hype and anxiety, what exactly is GPT-3? <strong>Why this AI surprised so many devs in particular?</strong> Is this game changer?</p>



<h3>For science</h3>



<p>Today, we will discuss artificial intelligence. And I know that this subject tends to piss off a lot of people very quickly. Especially developers. Y<strong>et, for now, AI is just a tool like any other.</strong></p>



<p>I’m not going to explain what AI is or how a model works. We will only talk about what unleashes passions, <strong>generator of hype or anxiety attack depending on the point of view</strong>, GPT-3!</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/kLrSCZK.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>The company behind this technology is <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>. OpenAI is famous for three main reasons.</p>



<p><strong>The first is that one of the founders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk</a>.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The person who is the most afraid of artificial intelligence in the world</a>. The other founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Altman</a> who we will talk about later.</p>



<p><strong>The second is the reason why this company exists.</strong> The goal of OpenAI is to develop artificial intelligence in a safe and sustainable way for human beings. Musk is convinced that uncontrolled AI will cause the end of humanity, so OpenIA promote a safe way to control it.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OpenAI - Non-profit AI company by Elon Musk and Sam Altman" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbcRlDBnwjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>The third is that OpenAI is frequently in the news with these impressive repeated successes in its field.</strong> Notably the former <a href="https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT2</a> models. The last one being our hot topic of the day.</p>



<h3>What’s GPT-3</h3>



<p><strong>Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">language model</a> that uses deep learning (neural network) to produce text. </strong>For the uninitiated, I’m embarking on a highly simplified explanation that will make specialists cry blood.</p>



<p>The principle of a language model is to look at one part of a sentence and predict the next word. <strong>GPT-3 is a technology that has been trained on a SCANDALOUS amount of text written by humans</strong>. Nearly a <strong><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/29/openai-debuts-gigantic-gpt-3-language-model-with-175-billion-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRILLION</a></strong> words via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common crawl</a>. Based on this small sample, it generates text (output) that makes the most sense for an input.</p>



<p>Concretely,<strong> by learning to predict which letters and words tend to follow each other when written by a human</strong>, GPT-3 is able to predict text that makes sense in a context. It’s the same concept as your cell phone predicting the next word when you write a message. Except that it’s infinitely bigger, more complicated and more advanced.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/xwi5mbF.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>And so far, GPT-3 is not bringing much new. The architecture of this technology (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-chaturangarajapakshe-text-classification-with-transformer-models-d370944b50ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformer-based</a>) is the same as the previous version (GPT-2). <strong>This architecture is almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 years old</a>.</strong> So what is so special about GPT-3?</p>



<h3>Huge</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is absolutely gigantic! GPT-2 was already huge with no less than 1.5 billion parameters. The previous record was held by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turing-NLG of microsoft</a> with these 17 billion parameters. <strong>GPT-3 explodes all records with an indecent 175 billion parameters!</strong> Never seen before.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And the aftermath of this is impressive results. GPT-3 is capable of far too much.</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#william-shakespeare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write poems</a></strong> in the style of certain authors</li><li><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI/status/1285776335638614017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write your emails</a></strong> with your own style</li><li><strong><a href="https://maraoz.com/2020/07/18/openai-gpt3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write blog posts about himself</a></strong></li><li>write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>number one blog posts on hacker news</strong></a></li><li>write<strong> <a href="https://jamesyu.org/singular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole fictions</a></strong>, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many fictions</a></li><li>even <a href="https://play.aidungeon.io/main/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>infinite interactive fiction games</strong></a></li><li>design <a href="https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1284511080715362304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>simple applications</strong></a></li><li>the list is endless and it’s getting longer every day… if you want to scare yourself, here’s <a href="https://gpt3examples.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>a website that groups them together</strong></a>.<br></li></ul>



<div><p>And GPT-3 is capable of something else that immediately worried developers. <strong>GPT-3 is capable of producing code.</strong> Do you want a todo list application in ReactJS instantly? Just ask for it.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I built a todo list app simply by describing it to GPT-3.</p><p>It generated the React code for a fully functioning app within seconds.</p><p>I'm becoming more impressed and aware of its capabilities every single day. <a href="https://t.co/QGrClar03s">pic.twitter.com/QGrClar03s</a></p></div>— Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dat-tran-a1602320_wow-sharif-shameem-created-a-gpt-3-code-generator-activity-6689448377245147136-H_0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">She can produce code</a> but also <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read and interpret it</a>. <strong>She can do this in <a href="https://twitter.com/josephbrionesaz/status/1283097878223675392?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any language</a>.</strong> Some SQL to do ? <a href="https://twitter.com/FaraazNishtar/status/1285934622891667457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No problem</a>.

Even 3D in Javascript <a href="https://twitter.com/Antonio_GomezM/status/1287969287110443008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be done</a>. In short,  some easy developer tasks can now be automated by GPT-3.</p>



<p>Of course, with all this exploding at the same time on the Internet, many have asked themselves the question of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/will-gpt-3-kill-coding-630e4518c04d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a>. <strong>For some <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/gpt3-is-the-beginning-of-the-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s the beginning of the end</a>.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, <strong><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/gpt-3-is-an-amazing-research-tool-openai-isnt-sharing-the-code-d048ba39bbfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI refuses to give away the source code despite its goal of transparency</a></strong>. The official reason? This technology is too big and greedy for people to run it themselves. They put it behind <a href="https://beta.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a paywall</a> that allows OpenAI to monetize its research.</p>



<p>Two months after the first appearance of GPT-3, most people agree on one thing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2020/07/19/gpt-3-is-amazingand-overhyped/#36405ce81b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>GPT-3 is as superb as overrated.</strong></a> And this is especially true for developers.</p>



<h3>Overhyped</h3>



<p>GPT-3 is super impressive. It’s a great tool to do a lot of things. <strong>But the important thing to understand is that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPT-3 doesn’t understand anything it produces</a></strong>. It makes a mathematical prediction that certain letters should appear in a certain order.</p>



<p><strong>A developer’s job is infinitely more complicated.</strong> Developing a complete application that meets a human need requires a lot of thought. No algorithm has the ability to think about problems the way humans do. No thinking, no reasoning ability, no nothing…</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" data-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZVSbJQuPouw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>Going further in the reflection we realize that <strong>GPT-3 is simply a new tool for developers</strong>. It is almost a new language where the interface would be directly explanations of what needs to be done instead of code.</p>



<p>And it’s quite relevant to compare the instructions given in GPT-3 to code. <strong>GPT-3 doesn’t understand vague requirements.</strong> GPT-3 needs very precise, surgical instructions, or it will produce crap. Where a human being will translate, correct and arrange vague requirements, GPT-3 will just produce crap. Or produce nothing at all.</p>



<p>GPT-3 is the largest look-up table ever created. Superintelligence is another story. It’s anything but today, and Sam Altam, the second founder of OpenAI, says so himself.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The GPT-3 hype is way too much. It’s impressive (thanks for the nice compliments!) but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes. AI is going to change the world, but GPT-3 is just a very early glimpse. We have a lot still to figure out.</p>— Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1284922296348454913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>And all this, not to mention the many limitations and nonsense that GPT-3 produces every day. So right now, developer are safe. </p>



<h3>What about tomorrow?</h3>



<p>Last year, I posted this article on <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/quel-avenir-pour-les-developpeureuses-informatiques/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of developers</a> (french version). I’m talking about no-code, low-code, quantum computing and many other nice things. <strong>I made the crazy prediction that in 30 years (that’s a lot) the machine will start to nibble away at some parts of our work.</strong> No replacement, just a nibbling of certain tasks, or even certain parts.</p>



<p>I had been crucified. Insults by email and on Twitter, unsubscribing and disappointment. I left the comments section as is (as always), it’s a beauty.</p>



<p>A year later, GPT-3 makes its appearance and proves that some very simple developer tasks can already be delegated to the machine.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i7j0QCj.jpg" alt=""></figure>



<p>GPT-3 can’t do anything against the job of developer. <strong>But this technology raises <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/openais-gpt-3-the-end-of-cargo-cult-programmers-23102f70f855" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the skill bar for becoming a developer very slightly</a>.</strong> To do what the machine can’t do on its own.</p>



<p>And if this bar is already rising today, where will it be in 30 years? I’m the first to find the speeches that demonize current IAs ridiculous. But the speeches that talk about an AI as stupid as its feet for eternity seem very naive to me. <strong>Where will be the skill bar needed to beat the machine in 30 years?</strong></p>



<p>I am also well aware that the way we make artificial intelligence today is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/openais-gigantic-gpt-3-hints-at-the-limits-of-language-models-for-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching a ceiling</a>. <strong>It would take a new and innovative way of doing artificial intelligence to make sense of my concerns.</strong> How can we be sure that these new ways of doing things will not emerge in the future?</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>For now, the future of programming is programming. Artificial intelligence continues its path, but as long as it doesn’t understand what it does, it’s going to be fine. You just have to put up with the fact that it is capable of more and more destabilizing things. How can you be sure that the article you just read is not written by an artificial intelligence?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>From time to time newly graduated hackers ask me: <em>“Do you have any advice for beginning my career?”</em></p><p>I’ve found myself repeating 3 principles over and over again. On reflection, I realized these principles apply more broadly. I <em>think</em> they might answer the question <em>“Do you have any advice on for beginning my life as an adult?”</em></p><p>I thought I’d share these ideas with you here. The style and the examples I wrote are career-oriented, but I think the core ideas will still help in your decision making. I hope you enjoy them : ).</p><p><em>What should you do?</em> is one of the hardest questions to answer when you start out.</p><p>The default path is to follow what’s popular or prestigious. That can lead to a bunch of problems: What’s prestigious is already highly competitive. When you compete with smart people in a game that has established rules, just keeping up will take most of your time. That leaves little time to explore what interests you. When you don’t explore what interests you, you won’t understand things as deeply, and that leaves you with an undifferentiated skillset.</p><p><strong>The solution here is to follow your taste.</strong> Popularity and prestige are lagging indicators. Your taste, especially as a young, curious person, is a signal for <em>what will be</em> popular in the future. Regardless though, when you follow you taste, you’ll find yourself much more interested in the problems you’re solving. When you’re interested in the problems you’re solving, you’ll discover deeper truths, build deeper expertise, a differentiated skillset, and have more fun along the way.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering: <strong>What if you don’t even know what you’re interested in?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. You just need to tune into and strengthen your taste. To do that, just do <em>anything</em>. Once you do <em>anything</em>, ask yourself, what part of that thing do you  find interesting?</p><p>Start going deeper there, and all of a sudden, you’ll discover a wealth of interests.</p><p>Next up, you may be wondering: <strong>What if your interests keep changing?</strong></p><p>Don’t worry. It’s totally fine. Just follow it. You’ll be surprised how things will serve you down the road. As long as you’re working hard and you’re learning, it’s a good use of time.</p><p>You may also wonder: <strong>What if your interests <em>are</em> what’s popular and prestigious today?</strong></p><p>That’s great. Follow that, but instead of competing, start sensing what actually interests you in that field and go deeper.</p><p>The ideas may seem career oriented, so you may be wondering: <strong>What if I just want to travel and explore the world?</strong></p><p>That’s great too! It’s your taste, telling you that you want to travel. Follow it and see where it leads you.</p><p>As you discover your interests, you may find that they’re not necessarily popular. Yet, when you go deeper and do your thing, something magical will happen…which leads us into the second principle:</p><p>As you explore and follow your taste, you’ll discover a subset of people who share your core interests and values.</p><p>Nurture those relationships. Some of these people will be your friends for life. Many of those people will become very successful in the future.</p><p>The people you know will show you what’s possible and work alongside you in deepening, exploring, and innovating on your shared interests.</p><p>You may be wondering: <em>what if you live in the middle of nowhere, and there aren’t people who get you?</em> Do your best to go to the center of wherever your community is. That may be SF for hackers or Los Angeles for entertainers or Paris for artists, the list goes on. You know where it is for you.</p><p>Now, this may sound impractical to you, but you’ll be surprised with what you can do. You can start off online in the meantime.</p><p>One common pitfall here is <em>focusing only on successful people in your field.</em> This misses the point. Sure, reach out to those successful people, but remember that the young, curious, interested people right next you, <em>will become those successful people in the future.</em> You have tons of time to spend together, so it’s great way to deepen your relationships. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t reach out to successful people (you definitely should), but to remove “success” as a criteria altogether for choosing who you spend your time with.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering, <em>how do you deepen those relationships?</em> That leads to us to the third principle:</p><p>As you form your community, new ideas and ways to collaborate will spring up. Take those opportunities: work together, support each-other and play. Over time, which you have a lot of right now, you will form a tight tribe of friends.</p><p>As a happy side effect, you’ll become exposed to new fields, new technologies, interesting problems, and interesting opportunities. Start taking them, and you’re well on your way to a career that’s <em>made for you.</em></p><p>One common issue here is a lack of self belief. This may lead you into choosing what you think “you are capable of”, rather than what you’re interested in. One way to get around this is to just experiment: let yourself dream and work with your friends, even if the problems seem fantastically hard.</p><p>There are a lot of examples I can give you if you’re interested in what I’m interesting in: From <a href="https://m.stopa.io/my-favorite-books-11e6b5a3ac0a" target="_blank">my favorite books</a> to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html" target="_blank">Paul Graham’s essays</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910" target="_blank">Norvig’s Paradgims of AI programming</a>, to <a href="https://m.stopa.io/favorite-rich-hickey-talks-6bcb23da6ff2" target="_blank">Rich Hickey talks</a>. But, instead I encourage you to think: <em>what interests you right now?</em></p><p>If you’re up for it, I’d love to know your answer: <strong><em>what interests you right now?</em></strong> Feel free to leave your answer in the comments or to email me directly, I’d be curious to hear : )</p><p>There’s a slew of people who have influenced and mentored me. These ideas are just as much them as me.</p><p>On the idea of taste specifically, the big shoutout has to go to Paul Graham. A lot of my thinking about this was inspired by reading his essays over and over when I started out. I highly suggest reading them.</p><p><em>Thanks to Daniel Woelfel, Talha Baig, Martin Raison, Irakli Safareli, David Magaltadze, Joe Averbukh, Julien Odent, for reviewing this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

Hey everyone,</p>

<p>It's long overdue for Twitter to add an edit button. It's really not that hard.</p>

<p>Help us put this billboard next to Twitter HQ so we can get the 2 days of
<br>engineering work that's required prioritized.</p>

<p>If we raise more than the $2,590 goal, we'll get a bigger billboard.</p>

<p>I heard they use Rails, so I went ahead and wrote the code for them:

<p>There, now just copy and paste!</p>

<p>With â�¤ï¸�,</p>

<p>The internet.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I like my two big hi-res monitors. I love my keyboard and my mouse. And I connect them to my stationary
“main” PC and to several other Windows and Mac laptops, alternatively. I’d like to easily switch where these peripheral
devices are connected to, and that’s the traditional role of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch">KVM switch</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, KVM switches that support 4K/60hz resolutions cost hundreds of dollars, there are
no KVM switches that support USB-C, and I couldn’t find KVM switches that support multiple high-res monitors
either.</p><p>So I decided to implement a mixed hardware/software solution: my monitors (all monitors today really) have more
than one input, so I can connect all my computers simultaneously. The idea is:</p><ul><li>Switch USB devices in hardware.</li><li>Detect this switch in software, and switch monitors inputs as needed.</li></ul><p>To switch USB devices, I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01N6GD9JO">this USB 3.0 two-computer switch</a> from Amazon,
that’s $38 Canadian, under $30 USD.</p><p>To automatically switch monitor inputs, I <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch">wrote some software</a>.</p><p>My plan was:</p><ul><li>Watch for USB device connections/disconnections.</li><li>When a configured device is connected, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI">DDC/CI</a> to
send a command to all connected monitors to switch inputs.</li><li>In case the power management turned the video output off, turn it on again (otherwise the monitors will auto-switch
back to the input that actually supplies video output).</li></ul><p>I needed this to happen on Windows and on a Mac, and mature cross-platform support for USB low-level
control and hot plug, DDC/CI and monitor power management is non-existent. I ended up implementing this two
times: <a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/MacOS">once in Swift</a>, for MacOS, and the
<a href="https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch/tree/master/Windows">second time in Rust</a>, for Windows.</p><p>Amazingly enough, this works really well: when I press the button on the USB switch, monitor input is changed
instantaneously, it feels like a “real” KVM switch! 🎉</p></div></div>]]>

<p>We create a 5-rule parser to efficiently and accurately parse affirmative present tense sentences in Japanese.  With just 5 rules you can understand Japanese grammar deeply.</p>



<h2>Deconstructing Japanese</h2>



<p>Linguistics is often unnecessarily complicated.  “Why state concisely with one term when there are 300 different varieties for these intimates and particulars?!”  Simplicity speaks volumes and good teachers teach simple concepts that help unify greater features easily.</p>



<p>To that end, let’s see if we can produce Japanese with an EBNF grammar.</p>



<p>For this we will be using <a href="https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse">an excellent functional library for clojure called Instaparse</a>.  </p>



<p><a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-LxnE95QbDy2LZ_m5XAZ/v1">You can see a <em>live</em> <em>demo</em> of Instaparse online with this grammar here.</a></p>



<p>Update: 2020-1-8: A fully recursive parser can be found here <a href="http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1">http://instaparse-live.matt.is/#/-Ly5y7xvJoDkHhIs0UKD/v1</a></p>



<h2>What’s an EBNF grammar?</h2>



<p>It’s like a regular expression for sentences.  “Extended Backus-Naur Form.” If you’re familiar, skip ahead.  If not…<br><a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf">Here’s a useful slideshow.</a>  The wikipedia article is not for the uninitiated, but <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/grammars-bnf-ebnf/">this article</a> is a bit clearer if you are new to this way of representing grammars.       EBNF is from the realm of “Context-Free Grammars” and is mainly used in computing.  Given that it is definitely about grammar and syntax, EBNF proves very useful in language analysis and generation.  You make rules for breaking down sequences of characters (sentences) into labeled output chunks (parse tree).</p>



<h2>Is it possible to parse Japanese with EBNF?</h2>



<p>Can we make any real headway using <em>computer syntax</em> to decipher human language?  English seems impossible for native language speakers to parse at times.  Is it really possible to parse Japanese with EBNF and label parts of speech accurately?</p>



<h3>はい！ Yes!</h3>



<p>Yes!  However, for <strong>real</strong> Japanese from the wild there would need to be many many rules, and any slight deviations from the rules would not result in a full parse.  So, rather than try and build our own google translate today, why don’t we just try to cover the maximum amount of Japanese with the minimum amount of rules.</p>

<h2>Rules for an EBNF Japanese Grammar</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns, verbs, particles, and sentence-final-fitters.  That’s it. *  <strong>With 5 concepts we can cover the whole Japanese grammar.</strong>  Amazing.  Japanese is regular enough that its composition can be described in a handful of rules.</p>



<ol><li>A sentence is made of zero or more Bunsetsu-Jars and a Sentence-Final-Fitter. <br><strong>S = JAR* SFF</strong></li><li>A Bunsetsu-Jar is made of zero or more Modifiers, and must have a noun and a particle. <br><strong>JAR = M* noun-no P |  JAR* noun-no no</strong> <p><em>[UPDATE 2020-1-8: fully recursive with extension of rule 2]</em></p></li><li>Particles can be any of the Japanese grammar particles that describe the role of their preceding word in a sentence: が、を、と、で、に、etc。 <br><strong>P = が | を | と | で | に …</strong></li><li>Sentence-Final-Fitters have only 4 options and can be either nouns with the Copula だ (da), or simply verbs with u, or verbs with i.<br><strong>SFF = noun-no だ。 | noun-na だ。 | verb-u。 | verb-i。<br></strong>(sentence-final period included in this rule)</li><li>Modifiers can be nouns  with their relevant letter (“no” or “na”), or simply verb-u or verb-i.<br><strong>M = noun-no の | noun-na な | verb-u | verb-i</strong></li></ol>



<p>With just 5 main rules we can parse all of Japanese.  That’s exciting!  Granted, this is not negation or past tense, just present affirmative, but with small extensions those advancements are accommodatable. </p>

<p>Notice Japanese has no spaces, all parsing relies on accurate detection of symbol in sequence.  ImagineifEnglishhadnospaceswoulditbehardtoread?</p>



<h2><strong>Recursion Update 2020-1-8</strong></h2>



<p>By extending Rule 2 (JAR = … ) to include JAR*, we achieve full recursion on Japanese terms using の [no]</p>

<h2>Death to Adjectives</h2>



<p>Japanese has nouns that take な [na] and nouns that take の [no] when they are used as modifiers.  </p>



<p>Japanese also has verbs that end with an う [u = oo as in “food”] sound and verbs that end with an い [i = ee as in “week”] sound.</p>



<p>Bringing “adjectives” into the mix just gets things really dirty and offers no benefit to the learner.  Stick with 2 kinds of verb and 2 kinds of noun and Japanese will be easy to master.</p>

<h2>Parsing Improves Comprehension</h2>



<p>Important in language learning are the exercises that parse written language correctly.  Learning how the written language is parsed can help one’s mental model, and this will lend to stronger audible comprehension thanks to a deeper understanding of the underlying structure.</p>

<p>*When we say “that’s it,” we are putting words like おいしい into the verb-i column, and words like げんきな into the noun-na column.  Simplifying into two categories, nouns and verbs, actually proves immensely useful and practical in Japanese.  It’s a simplification that should be in all the textbooks and literature.  Congrats 2020.</p>

    <p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sorry-dave.jpg" alt="Sorry Dave">
Nobody likes being told “No”</p>

<p>To sell your product to enterprise buyers, minimize the times when you need to say “No” during the sales cycle.</p>

<p>Enterprise software purchasing is a complex process with potentially innumerable stakeholders and procedural hurdles to cross. Even if you have a badass product that will perfectly fit your customer’s needs, you still need to wade through a complex buying process.</p>

<p>The decision to buy a product like Netflix is simple: I want to watch a once-in-a-generation classic like “<a href="https://bestlifeonline.com/selling-sunset/">Selling Sunset</a>,” so I pay for Netflix to stream it into my greedy eyeballs. As an individual, I make the purchasing decision and enjoy the rewards alone (thankfully).</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/enterprise_say_no/sunset.jpeg" alt="Selling Sunset">
I actually think that most of the characters on this show would be absolutely lethal at selling enterprise software</p>

<p>Contrast this to a buyer like the US Air Force deciding to use Slack – even just calculating the number of users that they’ll have is a non-trivial task, and that’s for a relatively straightforward, consumer-friendly SaaS product. Transformational changes – say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/jedi-10-billion-department-of-defense-bidding/">moving to the cloud</a> – can be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/microsoft-and-aws-exchange-poisoned-pen-blog-posts-in-latest-pentagon-jedi-contract-spat/">exponentially more complex</a>. The number of stakeholder approvals and compliance hurdles that must be vanquished on the way to this sort of purchase boggles the mind, but this is exactly where you make your bones as an enterprise SaaS business.</p>

<h2 id="detractors-want-you-to-say-no">Detractors Want You to Say “No”</h2>

<p>Innumerable potential blockers can arise during a sales cycle: you’ll have to say “No” to a particular use-case provided by the product that you’ll be replacing, or explain why you lack a feature that a buyer was expecting from a previous job. In most cases these gaps are unimportant… but these blockers can really throw a wrench into the sales process.</p>

<p>Adversaries who oppose a new software vendor will latch onto any time when you don’t say “Yes” like a lamprey – poking holes in the case to buy your product. Blocking stakeholders are typically incentivized to either preserve the status quo or explicitly harm your case, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teams who are incentivized to minimize risk, such as Compliance, Legal, IT, and (in some cases) Security.</li>
  <li>Teams who are frequently blamed if a poor buying decision is made, such as Procurement. Some companies also just have risk-averse, blame-heavy cultures in general.</li>
  <li>Champions of incumbent solutions – for example, an executive who originally purchased the product that you’re replacing.</li>
  <li>People who don’t want to do the work of changing to a new vendor.</li>
  <li>Competitors.</li>
  <li>(Rarely, but occasionally) people who are just nihilistic or obstructionist jerks.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest enemies when selling to a complex organization is <strong>time</strong>. Buyers get discouraged if it’s taking too long to sign a new vendor, and there’s often a small window when a company is ready for change and the stars have aligned for them to drop some serious coin for it. Detractors will latch onto any “Nos” that they hear and use it to delay or kill a sales cycle. This is especially common when replacing a strong incumbent – you had better believe that Oracle knows every trick in the book to make it seem that your product is untrustworthy or incomplete.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this, allow your sales team to say “Yes” as often as possible. The client is worried about some niche use-case? We have a partner who will make it happen. The client wants a particular security feature? We can make sure that the particular risk the Security team flagged will be handled. The client needs to format their data <em>just right</em> for board meetings? With a little bit of elbow grease on the customer’s part, we can support it.</p>

<p>Ways to say Yes more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make your product as flexible as possible - eg make everything programmable via API or expose webhook callbacks for all major business actions. This helps customers, consultants, or your implementation teams extend your product’s capabilities for use-cases that are unique to them, which you’ll never directly build yourself.</li>
  <li>Identify major gaps that will be a pain to build for, and find quality partners who can fill in these capabilities. Similar to the above, this allows you to cover niche functionality that only a few customers will need.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to transfer raw data into or out of your platform. For example, virtually every enterprise product requires some amount of internal executive level reporting, which is typically both critical and highly team-specific. By furnishing raw data exports you can check the box of helping to provide these reports. Being able to ingest or output large volumes of data also helps check the box of whether it’ll be easy to migrate to your product.</li>
  <li>Building common no-regrets enterprise features. For example, the areas of governance (SAML, RBAC), security (password controls, 2FA, internal endpoint protection), compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA), and audit logs are all areas where it’s easy to have a gap that will scare the shit out of a conservative buyer. By building for lots of use-cases in this area, you can ensure that you won’t get ruled out for missing features that are peripheral to your core value proposition.</li>
  <li>Find the right customers. If you’re constantly finding yourself saying No during the sales cycle, you’re probably selling to the wrong folks. This is common for early-stage startups or when your sales &amp; marketing teams aren’t generating enough pipeline (forcing you to sell to weak leads). Having a very strong perspective on why your product is special, and who it’s special for, can help you to avoid this trap. So can having discipline – you’re often better off doubling down on making your core customer deliriously happy than stretching for a flashy new logo.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the strongest form of #1 and #2 is turning yourself into a platform that others can build on top of.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-salesforce">Case Study: Salesforce</h2>

<p>Salesforce has a <em>decent</em> product. It’s by far the dominant player in the CRM industry, but it’s hardly a loveable product like (say) Zoom, Uber, Datadog, the iPhone, or even Excel. However, Salesforce has used this product to become the #1 in their industry, in part because their team can sell the hell out of it.</p>

<p>If you look at Salesforce, you’ll see that they use all of the techniques described above to ensure that they always have a story for how they can deliver, even if it requires extra integration work. Combined with their ferocious marketing, it’s little surprise that they’re approaching a $200B market cap as of this writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re well instrumented with open APIs, and use ampscript to build custom functionality.</li>
  <li>They have an app marketplace built on these APIs that’s filled with niche solutions, creating a platform ecosystem, and will also acquire companies to fill product holes.</li>
  <li>They have a robust set of reporting and data import/export functionality, allowing complex organizations to onboard rapidly with services (if necessary).</li>
  <li>Salesforce has a metric ton of enterprise features, and also aggressively moves to support new platform expansions that enterprises might want, such as migrating to Microsoft Azure for their hosting.</li>
  <li>Salesforce’s target customer is well-defined and obvious – it’s literally in the name.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-slack">Case Study: Slack</h2>

<p>Slack got its start by selling to smaller organizations and startups, but has since extended their reach into the enterprise. As time has gone on and they’ve begun to see real competitors, they’ve used all of the this post’s enterprise sales tactics to continue to move up-market:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They have a web of Slash <code>/commands</code>, webhooks, and APIs that allow for easy integration.</li>
  <li>They used these tools to build a successful app marketplace, completing the platform strategy.</li>
  <li>They once made it dead simple <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360001851047-FAQs-about-migrating-from-Atlassian-to-Slack">to migrate from their once-largest competitor, Hipchat</a> (they’ve since killed Hipchat in their sleep like Washington crossing the Delaware). <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/migrate-slack-to-teams">They still provide this for Microsoft Teams</a>.</li>
  <li>Slack is now packed with enterprise-grade security and compliance features.</li>
  <li>As a horizontal SaaS product, Slack is a good fit for many organizations and relatively unlikely to find a particularly bad-fit customer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Saying Yes often (or saying No infrequently) is important in enterprise sales cycles. To find more ways to say Yes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a flexible product with programmable hooks.</li>
  <li>Fill niche functionality with partners, turning yourself into a platform.</li>
  <li>Make it easy to import and export data in bulk.</li>
  <li>Build no-regrets enterprise features.</li>
  <li>Sell to the right customers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12) Ensure IP is Setup</h3>
<p>If not already done, select ‘Deny Outbound’ under ‘Action’. There are additional configurations available to include GeoIP and Reputation blocking. For GeoIP, select ‘Deny Outbound’ for any Continents you wish to block and modify these lists, as needed by selecting the pencil to edit.</p>

<h3>13) DNS Block List (DNSBL) Config</h3>
<p>DNSBL or a sinkhole/blackhole renders a site in it’s lists inaccessible. This gives you control over what users are able to access on your network.</p>
<h4>DNSBL SafeSearch</h4>
<p>If desired, enable SafeSearch network wide on Google, Yandex, DuckDuckGo, Bing, and PixaBay. You can also set Youtube restrictions and block Firefox DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="382" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Safe Search Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-300x143.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_15-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>DNSBL SafeSearch</figcaption></figure>
<h4>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</h4>
<p>We recommend you activate additional DNSBL not enabled by the pfBlockerNG Setup Wizard. To do that, you must select ‘Feeds’ and simply select the + next to the ones you would like to add. <strong>DO NOT</strong> select all feeds – we don’t add any IP feeds but instead limit our additions to DNSBL ‘Easylist’, all Ad Blockers, and some of the Malicious options. Don’t worry if some of the lists have duplicates, pfBlockerNG will make sure each entry exists only once. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="216" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png" alt="pfBlockerNG Feeds" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-300x81.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_16-768x207.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption><em>DNSBL &amp; IP Feeds</em></figcaption></figure>
<h4>Feed Grouping and Setup</h4>
<p>pfBlockerNG groups DNSBL together on its own. You will need to access these groups to make sure they are enabled and properly configured. This page also allows you to remove a list whose URL is no longer active or that you no longer want to use. The main things to check are that the ‘State’ is ‘ON’ and the ‘Action’ is ‘Unbound’.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="539" src="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png" alt="pfBlockerNG DNSBL Config" srcset="https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17.png 800w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-300x202.png 300w, https://www.advicesplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pfblockerng_17-768x517.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>Feed Grouping and Setup</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Adult Content Limitations</h2>
<p>The pfBlockerNG configuration above does a great job at everything we’ve discussed, but falls a bit short when it comes to blocking adult content. There is an option under DNSBL Category ‘Blacklists’ where you can enable Shallalist to block adult sites, but the list is large and not comprehensive. Other similar lists are also resource intensive so we ditched these lists and instead setup our pfSense firewall to use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families/" target="_blank">Cloudflare Family</a>&nbsp;as our DNS provider – a free service that blocks both adult content and malware. This paired with our pfSense firewall running pfBlockerNG gives us everything we need for a safe home network. </p>
<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>
<p>At this point you should have pfBlockerNG configured and running on your network. Now all devices on your network will enjoy blocked ads, improved security, and more privacy while online. Further pfBlockerNG tuning might be needed if you discover a page blocked or want additional blocks – just hop back into pfSense to make your tweaks. </p>
<p>Hope this helped you get pfSense pfBlockerNG setup on your home network. Let us know if we missed something or you have any questions.</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/i-converted-reactjs-org-to-use-hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://kickstartcoding.online/learn/articles/hooks-or-not-hooks">When we decided to convert our React curriculum to React Hooks</a>, one of the biggest stumbling blocks we ran into was that almost all of the guides, tutorials, and blog posts about React Hooks are written with the assumption that the audience already knows React. Most resources are written from the perspective of ”How to switch from class-style React to hooks-style React”, not “How to learn hooks-style React from scratch”.</p>
<p>Our curriculum has a lot of supplementary reading links in it and it wasn't clear where we would be able to find supplementary reading that taught React Hooks with a beginner rather than a veteran audience in mind.</p>
<p>After some discussion, we came up with a possible solution. <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">The ReactJS.org documentation</a> is an excellent resource for all things React, but the beginner guides and tutorial still use class-based React, and the hooks guides have the "aimed at React veterans" problem. This makes sense for these guides in context — a lot of people are still using class-style React, and most of the audience for hooks probably <em>is</em> React veterans — it just doesn't make as much sense for us as a coding school.</p>
<p>But the ReactJS.org site is also completely open source. So we thought: what if we just…updated it ourselves?</p>
<p>We decided to take a stab at doing just that and see how it went. This part of our curriculum update fell to me, so a couple of months ago I cloned the ReactJS.org repo and started experimenting to see how hard it would be to get up and running, adapted, and deployed.</p>
<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>It took a lot of work, and I’ll be talking about all the ins and outs of the update in a future post, because there were a lot of interesting challenges both pedagogically and technically. But for now the result is live at <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/">reactwithhooks.netlify.app</a>, and you can take a look at the repo where the changes were made at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks">the convert-all-to-hooks branch</a>.</p>
<p>The places you’ll find most of the converted examples and explanations are <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/tutorial/tutorial.html">the tutorial</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/hello-world.html">the main concepts sections</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/accessibility.html">the advanced guides sections</a>. For those, we converted the concept explanations, the directions, and all of the examples (including the ones on CodePen so you can see and run working code snippets). Everything from the step-by-step directions for writing a tic-tac-toe game in React to explanations on how to integrate React with older library’s like Backbone.js is now written with hooks in mind.</p>
<p>We hope this will be a useful resource for anyone who either wants to learn React the hooks way from scratch, or who wants to see examples and/or explanations of some of the more complex React concepts implemented in the hooks style.</p>
<h2>Helping Out</h2>
<p>There were a few sections that were particularly tricky to figure out how to convert, or to figure out if conversion was even possible. If you’d like to help us out, take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kickstartcoding/reactjs.org/tree/convert-all-to-hooks#unresolved-issues-with-modifying-the-docs-to-be-100-hooks">the ”unresolved issues” section of the README</a> and let us know if you know how to handle any of the things we couldn’t figure out.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://kickstartcoding.online/media-content/share/1599066782/407/"></p><p>There's still work left to do!</p>
</div><p>Also, of course, please let us know about any issues or bugs you fine to us the converted documentation. We definitely want to make sure it is as useful and error-free as possible.</p>
<h2>Fin.</h2>
<p>All in all, making this adaptation was one of the most fun projects I’ve been able to work on recently. We got a chance to use it as a resource for students during our last cohort, and it seemed to work pretty well. I’m hoping that it will be useful for other people trying to learn React as well, so check it out and let us know what you think!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5236373f3d12253d20393d217f3d3926337c313d3f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<p><em>Figure 1: The Jabber RCE vulnerability in action.</em></p>
<p>Security consultants from Watchcom discovered the four high severity vulnerabilities while pen-testing for a client. The vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 – 12.9). The four vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVE numbers are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2020-3495: Cisco Jabber Message Handling Arbitrary Code Execution (CVSS 9.9)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3430: Cisco Jabber Protocol Handler Command Injection (CVSS 8.0)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3498: Cisco Jabber Information Disclosure (CVSS 6.5)</li>
<li>CVE-2020-3537: Cisco Jabber Universal Naming Convention Link Handling (CVSS 5.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article describes the technical details of the vulnerabilities and gives useful advice for detection and mitigation.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is a video conferencing and instant messaging application. It is mainly used for internal communication, but can also be used to chat, call or conduct meetings with people outside of the organization. These days a lot of people are working from home and applications like Cisco Jabber are essential to stay connected, communicate efficiently and keep businesses running smoothly.</p>
<p>Given their newfound prevalence in organizations of all sizes, these applications are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers. A lot of sensitive information is shared through video calls or instant messages and the applications are used by the majority of employees, including those with privileged access to other IT-systems.</p>
<p>The security of these applications is therefore paramount, and it is important to ensure that both the applications themselves, and the infrastructure they are using, are regularly audited for security gaps.</p>
<p>During a recent penetration test for an unrelated client, security consultants Olav Sortland Thoresen and Torjus Bryne Retterstøl from Watchcom discovered four serious vulnerabilities in Cisco Jabber. The vulnerabilities range from medium to critical severity and two of the vulnerabilities can be used to gain remote code execution. The most severe vulnerability is also wormable, meaning that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.</p>
<p>Watchcom immediately reported these vulnerabilities to Cisco and coordinated a responsible disclosure. Patches have been issued and all Cisco Jabber users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest version.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>All four vulnerabilities affect the Cisco Jabber client application and were tested on Windows. The Cisco Jabber client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and uses the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for instant messages and presence updates. These two technologies are important for understanding the vulnerabilities and their implications. A brief overview of each of them is therefore provided below.</p>
<h3>Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)</h3>
<p>CEF is a framework that allows developers to embed Chromium-based web browsers in their applications. It is used to create desktop applications based on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Normally, the code running in the embedded web browser is sandboxed and cannot access files or perform system calls. While this is a good security measure, application developers often want such functionality in their application and therefore find or create ways to bypass the sandbox.</p>
<p><em><strong>This leaves applications vulnerable in scenarios where the sandbox normally would’ve provided protection.</strong></em></p>
<p>Additionally, many applications that use CEF choose to pass through command line flags to the embedded web browser. This means that many CEF applications accept <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags" target="_blank">Chromium command line flags</a>. Some of these flags can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs and should therefore be treated with caution.</p>
<h3>Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)</h3>
<p>XMPP is an XML-based protocol for instant messaging and presence. It is based on an open standard and is widely used in both open-source and proprietary software. XMPP is an extensible protocol and several extensions that provide additional functionality to the protocol exist.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure2.png" height="209" width="1137"> <em>Figure 2: An XMPP message containing both a plaintext and an HTML version of a message.</em></p>
<p>One of these extensions is XEP-0071: XHTML-IM. This extension defines how instant messages containing HTML formatted content can be exchanged over XMPP. Since HTML content can contain malicious elements, the specification states that applications must assume that messages containing HTML are malicious and sanitize them accordingly.</p>
<p>It also states that it must be possible for users to prevent automatic loading of images. Not all applications take such precautions and we will later see how this is the root cause of two of the vulnerabilities that we discovered.</p>
<h3>Cross Site Scripting Leading to RCE Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Cisco Jabber is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) through XHTML-IM messages. The application does not properly sanitize incoming HTML messages and instead passes them through a flawed XSS filter.</p>
<p>The filter is based on a blacklist of known-bad tags and attributes, but it is not comprehensive. Since the application is based on CEF, its embedded web browser will execute any scripts that can pass through the filter.</p>
<p>We discovered that the filter could be bypassed using the lesser-known onanimationstart attribute. Tags that had this attribute were not caught by the filter and were directly inserted into the embedded web browser’s DOM. This attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be called when an element’s CSS animation starts playing. To achieve XSS using this attribute the element must have an animation assigned to it. It was not possible to inject custom CSS animations since &lt;style&gt; tags were caught by the filter, but we discovered a built-in animation called spinner-grow by grepping through the files in the installation directory. By combining these two, it was possible to create malicious HTML tags that bypassed the filter and were executed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure3.png" height="387" width="1003"> <em>Figure 3: An XHTML-IM message that has been intercepted and modified. A malicious &lt;img&gt; tag has been added.</em></p>
<p>Cisco Jabber uses XHTML-IM by default for all messages. A malicious message can therefore easily be created by intercepting an XMPP message sent by the application and modifying it. Attackers can do this manually on their own machine or it can be automated to create a worm that spreads automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure4.png" height="783" width="1123"> <em>Figure 4: When the victim receives the message, the JavaScript code is executed. In this case the code opens an alert box as a proof of concept.</em></p>
<p>After achieving XSS, we started looking for ways to escape the CEF sandbox. A vulnerable function (named window.CallCppFunction) was identified. This function is used to invoke native C++ code and the application uses it to, among other things, open files received from other Cisco Jabber users.</p>
<p>We discovered that this function can be abused by an attacker to run arbitrary executable files on the victim’s machine. The function takes a file:// URL as its second parameter and by manipulating this parameter an attacker can execute arbitrary .exe files.</p>
<p><em><strong>Since Cisco Jabber supports file transfers, an attacker can initiate a file transfer containing a malicious .exe file and force the victim to accept it using an XSS attack. </strong></em></p>
<p>The attacker can then trigger a call to window.CallCppFunction, causing the malicious file to be executed on the victim´s machine.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure5.png" height="464" width="794"> <em>Figure 5: An XHTML-IM message containing exploit code that escapes the CEF sandbox and launches calc.exe on the victim’s machine.</em></p>
<p>This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2020-3495 with a CVSS score of 9.9 (Critical) / CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</p>
<h3>Protocol Handler Vulnerability</h3>
<p>While researching the XSS vulnerability, we discovered another high severity vulnerability concerning the handling of URLs with custom protocols.</p>
<p>Upon installation, Cisco Jabber registers protocol handlers for a number of different protocols. These are used to tell the operating system that whenever a user clicks on a URL containing one of the custom protocols (e.g. ciscoim:test@example.com) the URL should be passed to Cisco Jabber. In this case, the protocol handlers specify that the URL should be passed as a command line flag.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://watchcom.no/siteassets/figure6.png" height="255" width="1032"> <em>Figure 6: One of Cisco Jabber’s protocol handlers. The protocol handler specifies that URLs should be passed to the application as a command line flag.</em></p>
<p>These protocol handlers are vulnerable to command injection because they fail to consider URLs that contain spaces. By including a space in the URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line flags that will be passed to the application. Since the application uses CEF and accepts Chromium command line flags, several flags that can be used to execute arbitrary commands or load arbitrary DLLs exist. An example of such a flag is --GPU-launcher. This flag specifies a command that will be executed when CEFs GPU process is started.</p>
<p>This vulnerability can be combined with the XSS vulnerability to achieve code execution without transferring any files to the victim. This makes it possible to deliver malware without writing any files to disk, thus bypassing most antivirus software.</p>
<p>The video below shows the vulnerability being exploited. The attacker sends a malicious message, containing an XSS payload that escapes the CEF sandbox and uses the protocol handler vulnerability to execute commands on the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>I went through Y Combinator’s W16 batch for my company StrongIntro — we helped tech companies grow their engineering teams through employee referrals. I was 17 at the time and the youngest founder in the batch of 300+ entrepreneurs. Here's what I learned:</p> <h2>The people you respect are closer than you think</h2> <p>I devoured all of PG's essays and read founder bios in my spare time growing up. Coming from a Boston suburb, I thought it would take ages to get to Silicon Valley and meet the founders I respected, let alone work alongside them. But I was able to get a job in SF with a single cold email and zero connections. A year later I was in YC listening to the founders of Reddit and Airbnb share their stories and getting advice from PG.</p> <p>This is not the case in the rest of the world, but Silicon Valley is incredibly welcoming to newcomers. If you're willing to work hard and create value it's entirely possible to work alongside the people you most respect within a short time period. I consider that magic.</p> <h2>No one knows the right answer</h2> <p>One of the first lessons YC taught us is that the partners, who were successful entrepreneurs and operators, would give us conflicting advice and that that's normal. This felt wrong to me. In school, the experts — teachers — always knew the right answer, and yet these partners who were the most successful people I'd met couldn't give me “correct” answers that would guarantee my startup’s success.</p> <p>This dampened my amazement at the time but it was also empowering. It showed me that my ideas could be just as valid as someone who's incredibly successful.</p> <h2>You don't need experience to get started</h2> <p>Outside of my own experience of getting into YC at a young age, there are numerous other examples of founders succeeding wildly with little to no experience. The Airbnb founders didn't have experience in hospitality, and they only came up with the idea after brainstorming startup ideas because they wanted to start a company (ironically VCs usually say this is not a good way to start a company). More recently, my batchmate Boom has been making waves building supersonic passenger airplanes. The founder was a software engineer at Groupon before starting the company.</p> <h2>Experience is only loosely correlated with age</h2> <p>The average age of the founders in my batch was 30. Going into the program I was intimidated that everyone else had so much more working experience than me, but I quickly learned that we were all winging it as most were first time founders like myself. YC's group office hours were a time for founders to share what they were struggling with, and everyone, regardless of age struggled with the same general problems such customers not liking their product enough, not growing fast enough, and cofounder difficulties.</p> <h2>Silicon Valley doesn't care about your background</h2> <p>In the East Coast experience and status are highly valued. Bill Gates created class scheduling software in high school, and I wanted to replicate that. I approached our school admin about doing the same when I was 16 and was promptly shut down because I was too young and "entire companies are required to create scheduling software." I wasn't even given the chance to fail.</p> <p>In contrast, no one cared about my age in YC. Most people didn't realize I was 17, and if they learned my age they always saw it as a positive trait instead of something that would hold me back. This stark difference in mindset makes sense when you consider how many young founders have famously succeeded in Silicon Valley (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg) which is a trend that still persists to this day (Scale, Brex, Luminar).</p> <h2>Failure is acceptable</h2> <p>My company ultimately didn't succeed (we realized we needed to build a services business more than a technology business and that's not what we set out to do), and that was entirely okay. Most YC companies fail and it's baked into their business model — YC partners were even willing to fund my next business. This surprised me because school trained me to avoid failure at all costs — a single bad grade could tarnish my GPA permanently. The consensus goal was to get the right grades and internships to build a good resume, without any gaps that could tarnish the record.</p> <p>Silicon Valley's willingness to embrace failure is unintuitive but entirely logical. Startups aren't like school because there's no guaranteed playbook for starting a successful company — you need good execution but also experimentation and luck. Most applicants get rejected from YC multiple times before getting in, and most founders fail multiple times before succeeding. Travis Kalanick's first company failed. His second company had a modest exit after 6 years of grinding, and his third company was Uber. The Honey founders ran startups that didn’t go anywhere for years before they started Honey. Twitch was a struggling general-purpose streaming site before they doubled down on the gaming niche. The examples are endless. Failure is a necessary ingredient to success and Silicon Valley rightly internalizes that.</p> <div> <h3>Random musings</h3> <h4>East Coast vs West Coast</h4> <p>There's a more generalizable point in that the East Coast is typically more conservative than the West Coast. This is observable when dealing with venture capitalists from both sides as well. East Coast VCs are much more conservative, which is ultimately bad because it results in less moonshots succeeding. There are exceptions as well of course (ie Thrive Capital is ambitious and will bet on moonshots).</p> </div> </div></div>]]>

<!--more-->
<p>The Factual set out this week to round up the latest on the USPS and clarify key issues using the most credible stories about the topic from across the political spectrum. Our key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>DeJoy’s reforms at the USPS are meant to shore up the long-ailing agency, but his changes have led to a <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slowdown in mail delivery</span></a>. This comes at a time when mail delivery and security are top concerns for citizens about to vote in a general election and when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>low-cost shipping</span></a> is crucial for small businesses.</li>
<li>Despite accusations of a plot by Trump to hinder the USPS before the election, and albeit suspicious timing, there’s not much hard evidence that the changes are likely to impact the delivery of mail-in ballots — or are <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/06/america-is-going-to-vote-by-mail-were-not-ready/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>intended to do so</span></a>.

<h3><strong><br>Why Are People Worried About the Mail?</strong></h3>
<div><p>Mail delivery has started to experience serious and widespread delays immediately following a series of policy changes enacted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy in July. The impacts have been felt widely across the country. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/health/Covid-us-mail-prescription-drugs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Seniors</span></a> and<a href="https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/usps-delays-veteran-prescriptions-va-working-on-solutions" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> <span>veterans</span></a> have missed out on the timely delivery of medications that routinely arrive by mail — as many as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/usps-delays-endanger-14-million-people-who-wont-get-their-medication-in-time-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>14 million Americans</span></a> may not receive needed medication on time. Poultry farmers that have used the mail to deliver baby chicks since 1918 have seen chicks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/22/chicks-cockroaches-crickets-frogs-how-mail-delays-are-affecting-live-animal-trade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>die by the thousands</span></a> due to delays in service. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Small businesses</span></a> that have relied on the competitive postage rates of USPS have seen packages go late or undelivered; their business models may entirely collapse if they are forced to use private shipping methods such as UPS and FedEx.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OqZHoIvQXDtuoWRBkEACBkCYSr7YXmQUncjH599Z6p2vjb6h-hS-yJ6rdvi0Tza0QaegBgHjomfbLKp3nnE_p0KH1qNRoNZaN-WbAbrTuHiQdabUfKQMlDN-W4eRYiiQpu4rykhR" width="624" height="359"></span></p>
<div><p>The decline in processing time (orange line) is what is driving the delays in mail delivery.&nbsp;Source: USPS.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p>The impacts are geographically diverse as well. Across postal delivery regions where first-class mail tends to arrive on-time 90% of the time or more, there has been <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>double-digit declines</span></a> in the percentage of mail delivered on time, with sub-areas like Northern Ohio falling to just 68%. In aggregate, the national percentage of on-time delivery declined from 91% to 84%. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/usps-california-overwhelme-food-rots-and-animals-dies-in-cuts-chaos-2020-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports have emerged</span></a> of mailing locations overrun with packages of rotting fruit, poultry, and other perishable products — all the product of new operational changes that seem to have reduced the USPS’s ability to deliver mail on time. DeJoy has <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>acknowledged the delays</span></a> and assumed at least some of the blame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downturn coincided with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-explicitly-links-mail-in-voting-and-his-opposition-to-post-office-financial-relief-2020-08-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>remarks</span></a> from President Trump that expressed his distrust of mail-in ballots and preference for the postal service not to receive additional funding that would make it easier for more people to vote by mail: “They need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots . . . If they don’t get those two items, that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting because they’re not equipped to have it.” In the context of a heated national election just weeks away in which well over <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/08/19/election-2020-biden-voters-twice-likely-vote-mail-survey-finds/3399498001/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>a third of registered voters</span></a> are expected to vote by mail, the consequences of potential politically-motivated meddling with the postal service have not been not lost on civil society or Trump’s political opponents.</p>
<p>“It was after DeJoy got to work that the mail delays began, according to multiple postal service-related union leaders and trade groups interviewed by Recode.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Vox</span></a></p>
<div><p>Driving these concerns is that DeJoy appears to be a politically-motivated appointment (common in both Republican and Democratic administrations) and a <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/18/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-donated-big-to-gop-trump--his-wife-got-ambassador-post/"><span>large donor</span></a> to the Republican Party and Trump’s campaign. The timing of Trump’s remarks with the rapid deterioration in the postal service gave rise to concern that these events were in fact connected and intentional, rather than <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/"><span>coincidental and untargeted</span></a>, and could have enormous impact on an upcoming election. Coupled with the more mundane changes to an essential service for many Americans, understanding exactly what is going on with the postal service has become of vital importance.</p></div>
<h3><strong>DeJoy’s Reforms to the USPS</strong></h3>
<p>DeJoy inherited an already ailing government agency burdened by shifting patterns of demand (total mail volume <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>has declined</span></a> by roughly 16% since 2010 ) and <a href="https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>unrealistic financial burdens</span></a> (USPS must pre-fund its post-retirement healthcare costs for 75 years into the future, a cost imposed on no other government agency). Covid-19 has placed further pressure on the agency. Approximately 40,000 of its 600,000 employees have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>placed under quarantine</span></a> since the pandemic started. A further decline in the mailing of letters has thankfully been offset by a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>surge in packages</span></a>, an economic boost that looks likely to keep the USPS solvent into 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chronic loss-making has driven conservatives’ criticism of wasteful government spending and led to demands for privatization. Liberal perceptions have it that the agency serves as critical connective sinew that delivers essential services to places the private sector would leave behind. An experienced businessman, DeJoy began as postmaster general in June and set out to curb losses and reform the system.</p>
<p>Among his changes, the most notable have focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overtime hours and operational changes:<br></strong><span>Many of the mail delays experienced around the country are likely related to DeJoy’s rules about limiting overtime and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/small-businesses-say-theyre-suffering-mail-delivery-delays" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional daily trips</a><span>. For a long time, on-time mail delivery has been driven in large part by </span><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/08/06/mail-carriers-deliver-medicine-and-mail-till-dark-thanks-to-covid-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">long-hours</a><span> and additional </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/10/fact-check-request-ballots-early-but-mail-isnt-intentionally-slow/5538705002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">daily trips</a><span> by mail carriers when the mail for a specific route couldn’t be carried in one trip. These limitations, along with </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxq47q/usps-plans-to-slash-hours-at-many-post-offices-hoping-to-save-a-buck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shortened post office hours</a><span>, are pretty clearly connected to mail delays across the country.</span></li>
<li><strong>Mail sorting machines: </strong>These changes sound ominous, especially in the face of a glut of election-related mail, but are not particularly out of the ordinary. Given the declining trends in mail, the USPS regularly takes such machines out of service, though this year’s declines are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/20/postal-service-mail-sorters-removals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>larger than normal</span></a> — equivalent to about 13% of the USPS’s total sorting capacity (USPS removed 3% in 2018 and 5% in 2019).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removal of public mailboxes: </strong>Mailbox removals are also fairly normal for the postal service, given the declining trends in mail volume. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/512538-postal-service-defends-removing-mailboxes-after-stack-of-discards" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Viral images</span></a> of box removals, both legitimate and years-old, stoked concerns that such changes would negatively impact the forthcoming election. DeJoy <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>testified that</span></a> about 700 boxes have been removed under his tenure and that 35,000 have been removed in the last decade (roughly 3,500 a year).</li>
<li><strong>Mail truck changes: </strong>Part of DeJoy’s changes have been to enforce <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/24/postmaster-general-louis-dejoy-usps-board-chairman-robert-duncan-testify-house-oversight-hearing-postal-service/#570a9f6f6d5a'" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>strict departure times</span></a> for the larger mail carrier trucks that traverse the nation. The effort, meant to keep the agency moving on schedule, has led to perverse outcomes such as these trucks traveling <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/newschannel-5-investigates/postal-trucks-sometimes-travel-across-country-with-no-mail-after-usps-cuts" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>completely empty</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<div><p>These changes have been decried publicly by Democrats (including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/902109991/trump-admits-to-opposing-funding-for-postal-service-to-block-more-voting-by-mail" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Joe Biden</span></a>), civil society organizations, and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/29/usps-postal-service-privatization/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>USPS employees</span></a>. At least <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/08/25/more-than-20-states-attorneys-general-suing-postal-service-usps-changes-despite-dejoy-reversal/#56a2d0d04533" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>20 states</span></a> have sued DeJoy over the changes. And malicious or not, the changes have pretty clearly led to a widespread impacts on the USPS’s ability to deliver mail in a timely manner — all at a time when Americans are relying on it in several ways.</p></div>
<h3><strong>Will DeJoy’s Changes Influence the Election?</strong></h3>
<p>Through two testimonies, DeJoy was adamant that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/postal-service-flashpoint-ahead-2020-election/story?id=72420566" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>no further changes</span></a> would be made prior to the elections and insisted that the USPS is <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/22/21396968/uses-postal-service-democrats-special-session-dejoy-trump-25-billion-election-voting" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>highly confident</span></a> in delivering mail-in ballots on time. Many are quick to point out that the anticipated surge in ballot-related mail is really just a <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/21/post-office-expects-9-billion-loss-this-year-but-will-prioritize-mail-in-ballots-before-election-day/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>drop in the bucket</span></a> in the grand scheme of the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/a-reality-based-look-at-trump-and-the-post-office" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>471 million pieces</span></a> of mail the USPS deals with daily. Additionally, USPS workers assign <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/8/7/21358946/postal-service-mail-delays-election-trump-mail-in-ballots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>utmost priority to ballot-related mail</span></a>, and DeJoy has indicated that they will even <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>give ballots priority</span></a> over first-class mail if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We will deploy processes and procedures that advances any election mail, in some cases ahead of first class mail.” - <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-deny-usps-delays-despite-evidence-of-service-failures" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Postmaster DeJoy</span></a></p>
<div><p>A series of letters sent out by the USPS to <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/08/usps-mail-slowdown-dejoy-trump-election.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>46 states</span></a> prior to the election warned of the danger of ballots not being delivered on time, creating further concern for election watchers. However, the letters appear to be more of a matter of routine, impressing the importance of having voting deadlines that provide the USPS plenty of time to do their job, given past examples of sudden gluts of ballot related mail. These concerns don’t appear to be driven by DeJoy’s changes.</p></div>
<p><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T_f9bCh1Zar2xUOsrrzOIgmwCMXD3B6gCv164mzuqlRX0UqFBTmzTf9ZFrstQXqO02MoQZ-GNbVTvqPgZHFpGcZAIFAmNgXPlr3OtQ5dAjxg7V4hd2zEgBkbxsTyWdVLoyBL8PzI" width="343" height="343"></span></p>
<p><br>But these formal assurances will do little to settle the nerves of those concerned with the upcoming election. In the context of the doubt President Trump has cast on mail-in ballots and the heated nature of the election, there is little room for error. Were ballots not to arrive on time, it could have outsized impacts in battleground states and cast doubt on close results. And <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/21/leaked-email-us-postal-service-instructs-workers-not-to-reconnect-sorting-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>reports from …</span></a></p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>Releasing a connected device in today’s world without some form of monitoring in
place is a recipe for trouble. How would you know how often or if devices are
experiencing faults or crashing? How can the release lead be confident that no
connectivity, performance, or battery-life regressions have occurred between the
past and current firmware update?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that you need device monitoring in place long before ever
shipping a firmware update to devices in the field.</strong></p>

<p>There have been several occasions in the past where I’ve introduced several
performance and battery-life regressions that were never caught in internal beta
testing of 50 devices. They were always subtle changes, such as an
“optimization” that ended up causing high file system churn (which reduced
battery life), or issues that crop up when connected over certain transports or
to different mobile phone models. These bugs were caught in one of two ways:
either a customer angry enough would submit a bug report, or we’d catch the
regression on our internal dashboards which were powered by our suite of SQL
queries that would run periodically.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, we lay the foundation for how an organization should instrument
their embedded firmware to measure performance, stability, and the overall
“health” of each device and an entire fleet of devices. We also compare and
contrast the various approaches projects generally take to surface these metrics
and I’ll discuss why I believe heartbeat metrics are the best method for driving
product decisions.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

  <p>This post is guaranteed to be the tip of the iceberg in a series of posts
about how to do device monitoring <em>properly</em> at scale. With this in mind, this
post will be slightly more high-level than a typical “Interrupt” post.</p>

<h2 id="fleet-monitoring-overview">Fleet Monitoring Overview</h2>

<p>Device and software monitoring is not a new concept. There have been many new
ambitious projects to solve the problem from a couple of devices to monitoring
millions of servers or containers.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about a few different variations of monitoring and how they
relate to us in the world of embedded systems.</p>

<h3 id="application-performance-monitoring-apm">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</h3>

<p>Application performance monitoring services collect and aggregate different
metrics on computer systems and software, and they alert customers when these
numbers either increase or decrease in abnormal ways. Common metrics that are
collected by APM’s are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CPU, RAM, and hard drive usage</li>
  <li>Response times and values</li>
  <li>Request rates and failures</li>
</ul>

<p>They work by installing hooks in various places in the code. Common examples are
the pre/post request handlers for a web application and the pre/post handlers
for a database transaction. By hooking into both sides of common operations,
they can take a snapshot of the system before and after, and compare memory
usage and time deltas.</p>

<p>When an APM is hooked up to every instance of an application, it can paint a
detailed picture of how an application, server, or fleet of either are
performing at any given time.</p>

<p>APM’s aren’t a new concept, as one of the largest ones, New Relic, was founded
in 2008 and is now a publicly-traded company.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup>,
ScoutAPM<sup id="fnref:scout_apm"><a href="#fn:scout_apm">3</a></sup><br> <strong>Open Source Libraries</strong>: StatsD<sup id="fnref:statsd"><a href="#fn:statsd">4</a></sup>,
CollectD<sup id="fnref:collectd"><a href="#fn:collectd">5</a></sup>, Prometheus<sup id="fnref:prometheus"><a href="#fn:prometheus">6</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="tracing-and-logging">Tracing and Logging</h3>

<p>I’ve grouped these into a single group because they accomplish the same goal.</p>

<p>Traces and logs give you an in-depth timeline view of what happened on a single
device and allow you to zero-in on issues as long as you know what you are
looking for. They work by having the developer install logs or trace events
during the coding phase or automatically by installing hooks in the context
switch handler and various system API calls.</p>

<p>Traces and logs, just like an APM, can tell you where most of the time is spent
in an application or system, but there are drawbacks.</p>

<p>The amount of data collected by tracing and logging tools is immense, and most
of the data doesn’t get used or processed. In their raw form, they are not
easily aggregated or actionable.</p>

<p>I view tracing and logging as a silo of (valuable) data that is only queried
when developers <strong>know</strong> there is an issue with a specific device.</p>

<p><strong>Software services:</strong> New Relic<sup id="fnref:new_relic:1"><a href="#fn:new_relic">1</a></sup>, Datadog<sup id="fnref:datadog:1"><a href="#fn:datadog">2</a></sup><br> <strong>Firmware
services:</strong> Percepio<sup id="fnref:percepio"><a href="#fn:percepio">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="crash-reporting">Crash Reporting</h3>

<p>How nice would it be to have in-depth analysis and alerts for every unique
crash, fault, assert, and error log that devices in the field experience? That
is what these services provide.</p>

<p>When any of the listed error handlers are triggered, these libraries gather all
of the relevant data, such as previous logs, backtraces of the currently running
threads, local variables, global variables, etc. and push all of this data to a
central server to be processed. These issues are then de-duplicated and
presented in a bug-tracker like fashion to the user.</p>

<p>These systems usually require an SDK to be shipped with the application. These
services must build and support an SDK that is written in the same language and
for the same framework as the application they monitor.</p>

<p>For firmware, they would likely install hooks into the
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/asserts-in-embedded-systems">assert</a>,
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-fault-debug">fault</a>, and
<a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-logs-stack-trace">logging</a> handlers.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing about crash reporting tools is they are relatively easy to
integrate because the entry-points they hook into are standardized by the
language and frameworks. They also surface hard to reproduce or never before
seen issues easily and provide a wealth of data to fix the problem quickly.</p>

<p>Software services: Sentry<sup id="fnref:sentry"><a href="#fn:sentry">8</a></sup>, Rollbar<sup id="fnref:rollbar"><a href="#fn:rollbar">9</a></sup>, Bugsnag<sup id="fnref:bugsnag"><a href="#fn:bugsnag">10</a></sup><br>
Firmware services: Memfault<sup id="fnref:memfault"><a href="#fn:memfault">11</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="instantaneous-state-monitoring">Instantaneous State Monitoring</h3>

<p>This is the category that most of today’s “IoT monitoring solutions” fall into.
They assume a near-constant connection to the Internet and hold the state of
every device in the service.</p>

<p>Devices can either push this information whenever states change, at regular
intervals, or the remote server can pull data as well.</p>

<p>These systems ingest many of the system vitals that developers and managers want
to know, like heap usage, current battery life, or whether certain peripherals
are on or off. These values can be queried across the entire fleet or a subset
of devices, but trends or custom queries are more difficult.</p>

<p>For instance, attempting to query for the amount of time the Bluetooth radio is
on per day is nearly impossible, unless the infrastructure is <strong>100% certain</strong>
that it received every state change event from the device.</p>

<p>The statistic of time-active is a critical measurement for embedded devices, and
is one of the best predictors of battery-life drain and performance.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-embedded-systems">What About Embedded Systems?</h3>

<p>Most of the above services or strategies listed above do not apply to
constrained embedded systems. Save for Memfault and Percepio, most of the
solutions would require orders of magnitude more memory, CPU, power, and
Internet bandwidth.</p>

<p>There is hope though. We will explore how we can manage to get the most
important and actionable metrics out of embedded systems and gain an
understanding of how devices are performing in the field.</p>

<h2 id="logging-vs-metrics">Logging vs Metrics</h2>

<p>I want to quickly cover the difference and use-cases for two common forms of
data collected from systems: logs and metrics.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>Logs are immutable events that happened over time to a single device. They are
instrumental in debugging as they help a developer determine what happened
before and after issues occur.</p>

<p>Logs are usually forwarded from individual devices to a centralized datastore
such as S3, or to a log aggregator, such as Elastisearch, to be further
transformed and processed. Unfortunately, more often than not, the logs are
ingested and forgotten about.</p>

<p>A developer might dig up a particular device’s log files in response to a
customer support request, but that requires a <code>pull-logs-from-s3.py</code> script and
a decent amount of time to determine where the device behaved unexpectedly.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Metrics are a set of numbers that give information about a particular process or
activity. They are measured over intervals of time and are usually just numbers.
This means that they are pre-processed and more compact than logs, which means
that you can store and query many more of them at once.</p>

<p>Metrics themselves don’t help developers debug individual instances of issues or
bugs, but they help organizations <strong>detect</strong> issues by measuring the data points
that matter most. For many hardware makers, these metrics might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Crash-free hours</li>
  <li>Average battery life</li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/BLE connected time per hour</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transforming-logs-into-metrics">Transforming Logs into Metrics</h3>

<p>Logs can be transformed, processed, and aggregated into metrics, but this
usually involves massive and complex data pipelines.</p>

<p>After working as a firmware engineer at a few hardware companies in the past, I
can tell you that I was out of my depth trying to parse logs at scale, and I was
rarely getting the help I needed from the web and infrastructure teams because
they had their own roadmaps to complete.</p>

<p>The other problem with logs is that they generally log state transitions and
force the developer or log aggregator to measure the time between these state
transitions. Let’s try to calculate one of the important device metrics above,
Wi-Fi connected time per hour.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[E][11:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
[W][11:45:00] Wi-Fi disconnected, reason: -2
[I][12:30:00] Wi-Fi connected
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This calculation is relatively easy assuming we can process logs linearly. We
see at 11:30 the device was connected to Wi-Fi, then disconnected at 11:45, so
the time connected this hour was 15 minutes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Running a profitable agency is hard.</p><p>Using said profits to reinvest into real estate, stocks and tech startups is much harder. Jay Vasantharajah did exactly that. He is a very inspiring entrepreneur who has built an award-winning PPC agency and 7-figure eCommerce business. Something tells me this empire is just starting. I was curious to learn about his story and hear about what built his discipline to focus on cashflow and create an impressive investment portfolio.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get started in digital marketing?</strong></p><p>I started building websites for fun, and eventually convinced a small local accountant that I could build him a website. I think I made $500 for it, and quickly realized that I really enjoyed building websites. I went on to build&nbsp; websites for all the student councils in my university.</p><p>I then started learning PPC and SEO to help my dad drive business for his airport limo business. By the time I graduated university (I studied finance and accounting btw) I had a pretty good handle of digital marketing and web development.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What is the origin story behind your agency, ClientFlo?</strong></p><p>I spotted the opportunity when I came across a large communication company selling a packaged PPC service to SMBs across Canada. The PPC packages being offered were terrible; they&nbsp; consisted of cookie cutter landing pages and copy/pasted campaign setups, and the results were terrible.</p><p>Yet this company was selling these PPC packages like hot cakes. I would spend hours reading and analyzing the negative consumer reviews. The demand for these services was there, and I knew based on my knowledge I could do better. And that’s when I decided to start ClientFlo out of my condo. I had no clients or connections, but the confidence that I could offer SMB’s better services.&nbsp;</p><p>I incorporated ClientFlo on a Friday, starting cold calling the following Monday and closed my first client within a week. That instantly gave me the confidence to keep going, close more clients and to grow my company. I would spend all day cold-calling potential clients, stay up all night managing the campaigns. Once ClientFlo had around 10 clients, I knew it was time to get help and a start to build a team.</p><p>As ClientFlo continued to grow, we moved to our first office.</p><figure id="w-node-679817d579f7-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f4ea500bc40bb28d71956d6_n4pj6bovIRI1ZU927m4iAqUKwOKelJ8HXRsUwG8iCIH4BzPYSoesJEqQTCL-cTFGd7A8Y9iHwnoAp9d3e2NpADmTuMVvcHv40o6sS8MHylx-fdS0ZH0urbWFkxevwhVfeJMxUDbW.jpeg" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>At the peak of the agency, what was the annual revenue and how many employees?</strong></p><p>Low seven-figures per year with about 5 full-time employees (including myself) and a couple contractors.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>How did you get initial sales for the agency?</strong></p><p>Straight <a href="https://jayvas.com/cold-calling-isnt-dead-and-why-all-entrepreneurs-should-learn-it/">cold-calling clients</a>. It was a grind, but ended up being very effective. I highly recommend all entrepreneurs to try cold-calling as early in their career as possible. It’s the “school of hard knocks” way to learn how to sell. And as any successful entrepreneur would tell you, the selling never stops - so get great at it!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Describe the process of being a general investor from an agency operator?</strong></p><p>Investing, for me, started way before my agency, ClientFlo. The cash-flow from my agency accelerated the growth of my investments portfolio.</p><p>I started my investing career <a href="https://jayvas.com/charlie-munger-is-right-haul-ass-for-your-first-100k/">buying a cash-flowing real estate property</a>, which made it easier for me to quit my job and start ClientFlo. I continued to reinvest cash flows from ClientFlo into more real estate and stocks. As my cash flows and asset values continued to snowball, it enabled me to <a href="https://jayvas.com/investing/">invest in riskier/higher potential opportunities</a> like my <a href="https://www.starterstory.com/stories/how-we-re-expanding-our-product-line-and-growing-our-top-line">eCommerce business</a> and tech startups. I now manage a diversified portfolio of investments full-time.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What are the major lessons you’ve learned from growing the agency?</strong></p><p>Since this was my first business, I quickly learned how to be an entrepreneur.&nbsp; In entrepreneurship, perseverance is key. Things are given to you and taken from you, so don't let either get to your head. Stay focused, enjoy the process, and have as much fun as possible.</p><p>An agency-specific lesson that I learned is - choose a niche industry as early as possible. We started off as a generalist PPC agency, but eventually specialized in the medical industry. There are a lot of generalist PPC agencies and therefore more competition. But becoming the expert in a specific industry gives you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p><p>Having deep product knowledge in a specific industry allows you to service your clients better, which leads to more referrals, industry connections, and positions you as the go-to firm. Not to mention that specialist services are billed at a higher rate.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for agency owners that want to use consulting revenues to fund new ventures?</strong></p><p>Not only are agencies great cash-flow businesses, they are also great <a href="https://jayvas.com/how-i-used-my-ppc-agency-as-an-idea-machine">idea generating machines</a>. If you are working with clients/industries that interest you, it won’t be long before you spot an opportunity that you can capitalize on.<br></p><p>Be curious and ask your clients a lot of questions to gain a deeper understanding of their business. Focus on your cash flows to help fund new ventures, and if you spot something -&nbsp;roll the dice. You never know what may become of it, unless you try!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div><p>MONTREAL -- 
	The Quebec government <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-hasn-t-released-official-data-on-school-outbreaks-and-hasn-t-said-when-it-will-do-so-1.5088184">hasn't said whether it will start updating the public</a> on COVID-19 cases in schools -- but some citizens don’t seem willing to wait.</p><p>
	
	A Montreal father who started a new crowd-sourced website meant to track school COVID-19 cases says it’s already garnered more than 100,000 page views.</p></div>
<p>
	By August, “I concluded we were going towards a second wave and our children would be in an experiment,” Olivier Drouin told CTV News.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“I wanted to capture the data at the source and make it available to all parents [and] teachers, for them to make informed decisions about back-to-school.”</p>

<p>
	Last week, as French-language schools reopened, he launched a homemade site called <a href="https://www.covidecolesquebec.org/">Covid Ecoles Quebec</a> that allows the public to submit reports of coronavirus cases at schools across the province.</p>
<p>
	It provides a list, and a map, showing the cases Drouin has been able to confirm to his standards after his own basic verification process.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it’s not an exhaustive list, and he says if the government started releasing its own numbers, he’d stop collecting his—but after losing some trust in official numbers, he’d want to check first that they were doing a good job, he said in an email.</p>
<p>
	Drouin is vice-president of a technology company that provides high-tech human resources software. He lives in Montreal and has two daughters, one 13 and one 15, he said.</p>
<p>
	His site so far has published the names of 33 schools with at least one COVID-19 case each. Aside from the skyrocketing page views, Drouin said he’s gotten “hundreds of submissions” in the last week from parents and others.</p>
<p>
	“Not all are published,” he said, as sometimes “information is missing” or, in many cases, he gets duplicate reports for the same case.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the fact that it’s crowd-sourced, there are some important caveats to keep in mind for anyone looking at his site: for one thing, he doesn’t try to count the number of cases, but the number of schools, he said.</p>
<p>
	If he can confirm, to his standards, one case linked to a school, the school goes on the list. The government, meanwhile, counts an outbreak as two or more cases.</p>
<p>
	As for verification, the “easiest way to verify is with a copy of the letter schools send to all parents when a case occurs, as this is now mandatory across Quebec,” he said.</p>
<p>
	If he doesn’t have this, he said, “I look for media coverage.” Some of the schools listed on his website have a link to a news article.</p>
<p>
	The website also has a map showing where the affected schools are. These come with another caveat: at first glance, the map seems to show huge outbreaks, with dozens of numbers attached to the pinpoint for each school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But those big numbers are not meant to show the number of cases, he said. They’re chronological to when he entered them, so a pinpoint showing “32,” for example, means it was the 32nd school he found, not that there are 32 cases there.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said his frustration with the government’s handling of the pandemic, and especially its transparency around data, had been growing for months before he thought of crowd-sourcing data.</p>
<p>
	“In particular, when schools reopened in May outside Montreal,” he said, “the government claimed a big success—however, no data was available to measure that.”</p>
<p>
	Quebecers only learned later that there were 41 cases linked to schools, he said. (That news was announced about two to three weeks after schools reopened.)</p>
<p>
	He believes that others have grown distrusting, too, due to a combination of government choices and data errors.</p>
<p>
	“Because the government fails to make this data available and accessible, it lacks transparency,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“People don’t trust the numbers reported every day, as there have been so many data reporting issues,” he added, referencing the infamous fax machines used to collect infection reports, and the data that has been reported as misplaced or contaminated at various points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’s not against kids going back to school, but he wanted more safety measures to be taken, including shrinking class sizes, improving ventilation, mandating masks in classes and giving more people the option of remote learning.</p>
<p>
	The Quebec government hasn’t said whether it’s even considering releasing data on COVID-19 cases at schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	So far, the outbreaks that have been made public—including one involving <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/81-quebec-city-students-in-isolation-after-covid-19-cases-confirmed-at-two-schools-1.5086503">81 people at a Quebec City school</a> and <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/two-more-cases-of-covid-19-confirmed-quarantine-extended-for-20-quebec-teachers-in-isolation-1.5087658">a Deux-Montagnes outbreak</a> that has 20 teachers in quarantine—have been largely up to the media to confirm, with the cooperation of the schools and regional health authorities.</p>
<p>
	Drouin said he’d like it if the province did begin releasing routine data on schools.</p>
<p>
	“Based on the quality, accessibility of the data they would produce, yes, I would [shut my site down],” he said. “I have a day job.”</p>

September 2, 2020 | https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/thoughts-on-product">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My day job is, officially, as a Growth Engineer working primarily on Unauth Product at Pinterest. It’s slightly different from my previous software engineering roles - typically, in other roles, I would be handed a spec sheet or design and had to implement it. Sometimes I’d design it myself, but the challenges were uniquely <em>technical</em> - I had to build something, and there was creativity in so far as what technologies and design patterns I’d use, but the features and product itself were usually dictated to you. They would either be so obvious that they were trivial, or they’d be handed down by some PM some point above the line.</p><p>Working on growth engineering is different - you’re responsible for the ideation and product, and focus around a north star metric, and can gauge the success of your ideas <em>objectively</em>. You own the entirety of the process, and have a quantifiable number at the end (for unauth and SEO, it’s usually traffic, time on site, and, most importantly, user acquisition).</p><p>This lends itself to an interesting focus at work every day. You want to build a product that is actually enjoyed and valuable to users, while still trying to “game” their attention and behavior.</p><p>The following are some thoughts I’ve had from working and consulting in growth at startups and companies of various sizes, mostly in the consumer tech space:</p><h2 id="thoughts-on-users-and-product">Thoughts on users and product</h2><ul><li><p>Trying to get users to do something is less like being an omnipotent god that tells people what to do than it is reshaping rivers of user intent. You can’t control what a user does, merely guide the flow of their actions. Adding a huge button doesn’t mean they’ll click on it.</p></li><li><p>Removing the ability to do something won’t prevent them from doing it (and will most likely just increase distaste for your product).</p></li><li><p>Users are simultaneously smarter and dumber than you think. Dumber in the sense that, when you take the average level of product comprehension for a user of any site that is used by a significant portion of the world population every day, it’s fairly low. Especially when you’re focused on new user acquisition, they don’t know what to expect, or how to use what you’re providing them. At the same time, though, they’re <strong>on your site for a reason</strong>, and usually know what they want.</p></li><li><p>You need to make sure to put yourself in the same headspace as your users. As someone building a product, you have to remember that you have a significantly higher familiarity with it than the people using it. You’ll have specific names for each product feature and know the user flows and reasoning behind each action, but for a lot of the people that visit your site, it’s their first time there.</p></li><li><p>It’s easy for me, as an early 20s San Francisco based software engineer, to have a fairly skewed perception of the world. Remember the user can have every possible demographic and characteristic.</p></li><li><p>Make sure you track what your users do when they come to your site, and experiment often with major shifts to your platform. It’s incredibly easy to <em>think</em> that users are doing something for a certain reason, when in reality it’s baseless.</p></li><li><p>Everything comes at a trade-off. Sometimes this is strictly better, metrics wise, but other times the trade-offs aren’t as clear - it doesn’t mean they don’t exist, though. The choices in button ordering, what you put above the fold, the font size, it all pulls and pushes the user experience in different directions.</p></li><li><p>Build for everyone, not just the professional. It’s easy when building products at work to be in a professional mindset - you’re not really thinking about <strong>every</strong> possible aspect that someone could be using your product for. Users get value in ways you never could predict - it’s better to build a platform that is flexible and ambiguous than imagine a single purpose use for what you’re building.</p></li><li><p>You do not and can not control users, and should view yourself more as at their mercy than them at yours. Working on a product is a lot more like swinging your arms around blindly in a room hoping you hit the light switch than it is knowing exactly what people want and how to deliver it to them.</p></li><li><p>Question all of your previous learnings. Something might’ve been true in the past, but is no longer. The same experiment or feature can lead to differences in results based on some slight change in the product or flow.</p></li></ul><h2 id="thoughts-on-growth">Thoughts on growth</h2><ul><li><p>Your user metrics are almost always proxies for what you’re trying to measure. You’ll pick some north star metric and say that this is what you’re building around, but this is just a shadow of what you’re trying to measure - the nebulous cloud of “user enjoyment”</p></li><li><p>Sometimes building a more aggressive user experience is worth it in the long run. For example: By default, your site could have a 2% conversion rate and a 20% bounce rate. A new feature is introduced behind an experiment that increases the conversion rate to 3%, but increases the bounce rate to 80%. This is clearly a subpar experience - it increases your bounce rate by 400%. However, it also increases your conversion rate by <strong>50%</strong>. Depending on your product this can make sense (for example, anything with an LTV for each user that is really high, or that has a really high CAC). It might not be ideal in the long term, but having a short term lever like this can be instrumental to a product’s success.</p></li><li><p>User growth is often cyclical. Some products will have the same traffic every day of the year, whereas others will have time of day, day of week, week of month, or seasonal patterns.</p></li><li><p>Monitor everything. As a product grows, you’ll build out one-off features that are significant wins at the time, but which aren’t actively monitored. It’s cheap to add a log to something and just page a team when it drops to 0. This is significantly eased by TDD, but TDD is rarely the right answer when your main concern is growth (you should move quickly).</p></li><li><p>You should move as quickly as possible. Don’t work on an idea for a long time - build out the smallest possible version that gives you directionality (positive or negative for the user metrics you’re looking at) and iterate from there. Especially in the early stages of a company, moving slowly and not adapting to shifting market conditions can kill you.</p></li><li><p>Growth is product + a direction + fuel. Each of these is a multiplier on the others - any combination of these can make a successful company. The dream is to have a great product that knows exactly where it wants to go, with all the resources it needs, but this is very rarely the case. More often than not you’ll have a mediocre product that’s floated along for a bit while being severely understaffed. If any of them is 0, you’re DOA. There’s no pithy truism here - a company can succeed <em>because</em> it has great direction and resources, or it can fail <em>in spite of it</em>.</p></li></ul><h2 id="success">Success</h2><p>One of the most important parts of the above is that they’re not static. These aren’t commandments that are written in stone - they’re learnings that are based on trial and error, off of experiments and conversations with users. You’ll run an experiment one day that contradicts nearly everything you’ve learned about growth and product, and you just have to re-baseline yourself and take those learnings forward.</p><p>You have a lot of control in so far as what the user sees and has access to - you can never control what they do with it, though. Building something that keeps the experience in mind, and that is focused on long term, sustainable growth is all you can hope to achieve.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Shell is the essential tool for every programmer. The more familiar you become with the available tools, the more efficient you can be with using your computer. Here's a list of command-line tools written in Rust that aim to provide modern, often much faster, alternatives to the existing shell commands.</p>
<h2 id="bat"><code>bat</code></h2>
<p><code>bat</code> is a <code>cat</code> clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration that works on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It provides syntax highlighting for many file extensions by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223573-9b9eb780-de0e-11ea-94e3-908957fe5a4e.png" alt="bat"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="exa"><code>exa</code></h2>
<p><code>exa</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for listing directory contents. <code>exa</code> supports icons with the <code>--icons</code> flag.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223612-aa856a00-de0e-11ea-8cec-133becefa6f2.png" alt="exa">
<a href="https://github.com/ogham/exa">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="fd"><code>fd</code></h2>
<p><code>fd</code> is a fast and user-friendly alternative to <code>find</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for walking a file hierarchy. <code>fd</code> provides opinionated defaults for the most common use cases. To find a specific file by name, you write <code>fd PATTERN</code> instead of <code>find -iname ‘*PATTERN*’</code>. <code>fd</code> is also extremely fast and it comes with a ton of options like ignoring hidden directories, files and patterns from <code>.gitignore</code> by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223646-bbce7680-de0e-11ea-98f4-0ef2d5f30920.png" alt="fd"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="procs"><code>procs</code></h2>
<p><code>procs</code> is a modern replacement for <code>ps</code>, the default command-line program in Unix/Linux for getting information about processes. It provides convenient, human-readable (and colored) output format by default.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223676-c8eb6580-de0e-11ea-8e3e-fea30f173aab.png" alt="procs"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dalance/procs">GitHub</a></p>
<h2 id="sd"><code>sd</code></h2>
<p><code>sd</code> is an intuitive find &amp; replace command-line tool, it is an alternative to <code>sed</code>, the built-in command-line program in Unix/Linux for parsing and transforming text (). <code>sd</code> has simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences and it uses the convenient regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. <code>sd</code> is also 2x-11x faster than <code>sed</code>.</p>
<p><code>sed</code> is a programmable text editor, with search and replace being a common use case. In that light, <code>sd</code> is more like <code>tr</code>, but on steroids. (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/oleid/">/u/oleid</a> for the suggestion).</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90223698-d6a0eb00-de0e-11ea-85e7-7bf590794ac0.png" alt="sd"></p>

<p>1st September 2020, by Elliott Brown</p>
<h4>Today we're announcing NUM, a new DNS-based protocol to store and retrieve structured data</h4>
<p>
  The Namespace Utility Modules (NUM) protocol can be used to store structured data for any domain name or email address. NUM&nbsp;records can be stored in the DNS of the independent NUM zone (e.g. <code>_num.example.com</code>) or in the hosted NUM zone (a DNS-based store of NUM records below the domain <code>num.net</code>) using a simple web interface: <a href="https://www.numserver.com/" target="_blank">NUM Server</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-external.png" title="Content on another site." alt="Content on another site.">.
</p>
<p>
  We're announcing this experimental protocol to the technical community today and are very interested in feedback and input.
</p>
<h5>Custom and standardised records</h5>
<p>
  Custom NUM records can store structured data for any purpose, particular use cases are standardised with <a href="https://www.num.uk/modules">modules</a> <img src="https://www.num.uk/images/link-internal.png" title="Content elsewhere on this site." alt="Content elsewhere on this site.">. One of our leading use cases for NUM is contact information. Enabling organisations and individuals to store contact data in the DNS opens up lots of new possibilities like dialling a domain name or email address.
</p>
<h5>Automatically populating the DNS with millions of pieces of structured data</h5>
<p>
  As well as offering a simple, user-friendly way to adopt NUM, the NUM Server also helps overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. We&nbsp;intend to populate NUM records for millions of domain names based on website information hosted on those domain names. We&nbsp;expect to publish this data in early 2021.
</p>
<h5>Free, unrestricted and unlimited access to data</h5>
<p>
  Since NUM data is stored and served using DNS it's ultra-fast, reliable and massively scalable. Access to records on the NUM Server is free, unrestricted and unlimited forever. NUM enables organisations and individuals to take back control of their data and provides a valuable resource to developers building devices, apps and services.
</p>
<h5>Find out more</h5>

<h5>Experimenting with NUM</h5>

<h2 id="what-is-xls">What is XLS?</h2>
<p>The XLS (Accelerated HW Synthesis) project aims to enable the rapid development
of <em>hardware IP</em> that also runs as efficient <em>host software</em> via "software
style" methodology.</p>
<p>XLS implements a High Level Synthesis (HLS) toolchain which produces
synthesizable designs from flexible, high-level descriptions of functionality.
It is fully Open Source: Apache 2 licensed and developed via GitHub.</p>
<p>XLS is used inside of Google for generating feed-forward pipelines from
"building block" routines / libraries that can be easily retargeted, reused, and
composed in a latency-insensitive manner.</p>
<p><em>Not yet available</em>, but active work in progress is the implementation of XLS
<em>concurrent processes</em>, in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) style, that
allow pipelines to communicate with each other and induct over time.</p>
<p>XLS is still experimental, undergoing rapid development, and not an officially
supported Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it
out, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues">reporting bugs</a>, and letting us know
what you think!</p>
<h2 id="building-from-source">Building From Source</h2>
<p>Currently, XLS must be built from source using the Bazel build system.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Binary distributions of the XLS library are not currently available, but
we hope to enable them via continuous integration, <a href="https://github.com/google/xls/issues/108">see this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The following instructions are for the Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) Linux distribution.
Note that we start by assuming <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html">Bazel has been
installed</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Follow the bazel install instructions:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html
#
# Afterwards we observe:

$ bazel --version
bazel 3.2.0

$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-distutils python3-dev libtinfo5

# py_binary currently assume they can refer to /usr/bin/env python
# even though Ubuntu 20.04 has no `python`, only `python3`.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8685

$ mkdir -p $HOME/opt/bin/
$ ln -s $(which python3) $HOME/opt/bin/python
$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

$ bazel test -c opt ...
</code></pre>

<p>A reference build/test environment setup is also provided via <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>~$ git clone https://github.com/google/xls.git
~$ cd xls
~/xls$ docker build .  # Performs optimized build and test.
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>The phrase, "no man is an island," penned by English poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne" rel="noopener" target="_self">John Donne</a> in the 17th century, and championed in Bon Jovi’s song, Santa Fe, offers insight into a hallmark of productive workplaces: the importance of collaboration. When people can work together in harmony to achieve goals and get into a flow, the output isn’t just better, the environment is too. A Stanford <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103114000420?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener" target="_self">study</a> found teams that work collaboratively report significantly higher levels of engagement, lower fatigue, and overall higher success rates.</p><p>These days, so many of our workstreams and processes are cross-functional and require some form of cooperation. Which is why a well run system of collaboration is critical to team effectiveness. And while collaboration in a shared workspace can be challenging, collaborating with a remote team can be even more daunting. Especially when the main reason your company decided to go remote is a global pandemic.</p><p>Working from home can often feel like you're on an island, separated from colleagues, and left to deal with complex problems on your own. Or to figure out how to connect with your team while being respectful of their time. For most of us, it feels more comfortable brainstorming and bouncing ideas off one another in person—partially because it's what's familiar. But how do we take this clearly beneficial activity (collaborating) that’s vital to achieving our goals, and make it work effectively in our remote world?</p><p>Understanding what makes collaboration useful and how to adapt your processes to improve the way you collaborate is a start. Also, it’s important to address root issues that can derail remote collaboration and to have fun while doing it. Being intentional about how you bring people together and rejiggering your operational processes is essential to making sure your team functions like a well-oiled machine.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/1372b1fa5071c46caf22a64a946dae10481353e7-2000x945.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="What is remote collaboration?"></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h2><strong>What is remote collaboration?</strong></h2><p>At the most basic level, collaboration is the act of working jointly with others. It's people with different perspectives, roles, and subject knowledge coming together to share and shape work. Ideally this effort leads to a result that is better—more effective, more efficient, more impactful—than if someone toiled away on their own.</p><p>From landing humankind on the moon to mending centuries old divides between countries, when collaboration works well, it can yield breakthroughs previously thought impossible.&nbsp; It can even create social networks that change the face of human interaction, connecting over <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-statistics-for-social-media-managers/" rel="noopener" target="_self">50% of the world's population or more than 3.8 billion people</a>.</p><h2><strong>Remote work has changed the way we collaborate</strong></h2><p>In the past, we've almost exclusively done collaboration in-person. Whether it's bringing teams together that are spread across the globe for offsites or hopping into a meeting room in the office and creating elaborate "brainstorming art" on the whiteboard for all to see.</p><p>However, the way we work has shifted in the last few years—accelerated by the adoption of remote work due to COVID-19. But just because your entire team is dispersed, doesn't mean that collaboration is any less meaningful or critical&nbsp; to your team's success.</p><p>So, how do you make sure your team can still collaborate, and do it effectively? To avoid being one of the <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional" rel="noopener" target="_self">75% of cross functional teams</a> that are dysfunctional because they lack a systemic approach to working together, we’ve put together 5 actionable tactics you can put into practice stat.<br></p><h3><strong>1) Know how and when to collaborate synchronously</strong></h3><p>Planning an office collaboration session typically involves finding time on people's calendars, booking a room, and making sure there are dry-erase markers for the meeting. For better or for worse, you and your team let the magic of being in one place for a singular purpose take over from there.</p><p>However, for remote collaboration to work well, there's an added element to keep in mind: being intentional when it comes to topics and outcomes. Without many of the same organic interpersonal cues that creative work sessions provide, being clear and upfront about what everyone hopes to get out of the session and how folks can help is essential.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/bd25745327c1a3485da1464ff7ad43f662089347-2000x945.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Planning for your remote collaborate ahead of time"></p><p>One way to do this is to encourage attendees to prepare a topic, a goal, and what type of input would be most useful ahead of time. This tactic will help keep the group focused and make sure you're maximizing time.</p><p>At the end of the session, do a recap to see if it was successful. Ask these two questions: "Has this session pushed the project forward in a meaningful way?" And "Do owners feel more prepared or have clear directives to tackle the challenges in front of them?"</p><p>It should be noted that not all real-time collaboration sessions need to conclude with clear action items to be meaningful. But this should be stated at the outset and the goal should reflect this as well.</p><p>Before you close Google Hangouts, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, take a moment to assess how things went in terms of process and if there's something everyone would like to do differently in the next session. Iteration is an important part of the process.</p><p>Speaking of next time, another item to consider is the cadence or frequency of your collaboration sessions. These structured meetings for creative problem solving not only serve the purpose of pushing projects forward using your team's hive mind—in lieu of an office—they are a way to <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/social-business/energize-you-enterprise-with-collaboration/" rel="noopener" target="_self">connect and energize the team</a>.</p><p>Try hosting collaboration sessions twice a week, weekly, or every two weeks to determine what makes the most sense for your remote team. At the beginning, keep it consistent so that everyone gets used to the format and make the appropriate adjustments as you go along.</p><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@headwayio" rel="noopener" target="_self"><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/11eb91a1a0ac7f3a9e3168358fef18c7a66cd8d3-5472x3648.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Man communicating with his hands during collaboration."></a></p><p>Photo by Headway on Unsplash</p><h3><strong>2) Document your processes</strong></h3><p>When it comes to collaborating as a remote team, a shared understanding of process makes all the difference. This doesn't mean adding one new process after another. Instead, update your old processes for the remote context to help your team set expectations and be accountable to one another. It will give everyone a roadmap on how best to interact and communicate, and also take the guesswork out of <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/remote-onboarding-tips">onboarding new team members</a>.</p><p>One way to put a standard in place is to create a handbook—using a shared doc— that includes details about the best ways to communicate different types of messages and request feedback.</p><p>Think of it as a living document that can be updated as you test and learn how to best run your remote collaboration sessions. It should also add more color about how best to engage with someone on the team. Because everyone is working in very different environments, it can be difficult to know what impact having school-aged children doing remote learning or a roommate who hosts online fitness classes in the apartment will have on someone’s availability to collaborate. As things change, you’ll continue to update and evolve this document.</p><h3><strong>3) Make asynchronous collaboration a strength</strong></h3><p>One of the truly unique benefits of working remotely is leaning into collaborating asynchronously. In other words, being able to share and connect on topics and projects at the convenience of each team member and their schedules.</p><p>The staggered nature of asynchronous communication is a particular asset when you’re trying to keep the number of meetings down, while still ensuring everyone is in the loop and contributing. It will make your team more flexible and able to adjust to external influences more readily.</p><p>Start with the basics. There are a ton of tools and apps that make staying in sync when you’re not collaborating in real-time easy, like Google Docs, Asana, and Range. Build a culture of using comments and channels that allow people to share without being in the same place at the same time.<br></p><h3><strong>4) Your remote collaboration tool belt</strong></h3><p>Tools! They make collaborating across spaces and timezones possible. We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/collaboration-tools-slack">magic of integrations</a> and how tools like Range are designed not to just facilitate remote collaboration, but also strengthen team culture every day with features like team building questions and sharing a mood with an emoji. Here a few other tools to have that will slot right into your new framework. </p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/49f172ea53d27bac3468d4c70b7fa2a5e8c6fd10-747x539.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=330&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="App integrations in Range"></p><ul><li><a href="https://slack.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Slack</a> - business communication platform</li><li><a href="https://www.range.co/">Range</a> - team success platform that keeps teams connected and on track</li><li><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">G Suite</a> - full suite of office productivity tools</li><li><a href="https://asana.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Asana</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/home" rel="noopener" target="_self">Trello</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="noopener" target="_self">Jira</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" rel="noopener" target="_self">GitHub</a> - project management and file tracking tools</li><li><a href="https://mural.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Mural</a> -<strong> </strong>whiteboarding app<br></li></ul><h3><strong>5) All work and no play makes for dull collaboration</strong></h3><p>While collaborating remotely is undoubtedly about getting work done, you can still have a little bit of fun while you're at it. In fact, adding fun into the mix can help strengthen ties between your team and encourage engagement.</p><p>Playing a <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ice-breaker-games" rel="noopener" target="_self">quick game</a>, answering an <a href="https://icebreaker.range.co/" rel="noopener" target="_self">icebreaker</a>, or putting on music to kick things off are great ways to include levity and get people in the spirit of creative problem solving. Test different ones, rotate them around, and collectively figure out what works to get your team into the best collaboration mode.</p><h3><strong>Go forth and collaborate!</strong></h3><p>Now that you’re armed with these five tips on how to work better together as a team, it’s time to go reimagine the way your remote team collaborates. But the fun doesn’t stop once you’re safely back in the office—you should continue many of these practices when you’re co-located again. At the heart of this exercise is improving how you collaborate in general. Afterall all, great remote collaboration is just great collaboration.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/25a15bef9b76411971fd43c5d8a52fcb76f43685-480x270.gif" alt="Christina Tosi saying teamwork on Master Cher"></p><hr><p><a href="https://range.co/signup">Sign up for Range</a></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

</span><span>Videos</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>Texts</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>. The posts are similar enough that they will share certain attributes (like a title), but also different enough that they will require unique columns (a url column for video). In addition, we want to have a newsfeed feature where we display all posts by most recently created. This means we need to have a way to query across the entire</span> 
</span><span>Posts</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>architecture.</span></span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This problem is generally solved in one of two ways in Rails:</span> 
</span><span>single table inheritance</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>(STI) or</span> 
</span><span>abstract classes</span><span>. Since ActiveRecord models do not have to be backed by a database table, these solutions leverage Plain Old Ruby Objects in order to represent this inheritance hierarchy. Polymorphic associations also often get thrown into the mix but don't quite fit our use case (we’ll briefly touch on this). We’ll discuss the pros and cons of each of these approaches and shed light on a new Rails feature that combines the best of both worlds.</span></p>  
  
 <h4><span>Single Table Inheritance (STI)</span></h4> 
  
<p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>In an STI implementation, attributes are stored in a single parent class table and a</span> 
</span><span>type</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>column holds the name of the subclass for the given row. Subclasses inherit from the parent class which allows us to write Text specific methods on the Text class without polluting the Video class.&nbsp; Generating a newsfeed is also very straightforward since all the data is in a single table, i.e. we can do things like</span> 
</span><span>Posts.order(created_at: :desc)</span><span>.<br></span><span><br></span></p></div> <p><a id="1268435434" data-caption="STI example"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1798209722" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen+Shot+2020-08-02+at+11.00.04+AM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a> 
</p> 
 <div data-dmtmpl="true" data-element-type="paragraph" data-version="5" id="1828567217" data-uialign="center"><p><span>STI is simple to implement but can quickly get unwieldy as slight differences in models introduce new fields.&nbsp; This leads to wide tables that are full of null values storing information for a collection of now distinct models that are forced to share the same table.</span></p>  
 <h4><span>Abstract Classes</span></h4> 
  
<p><span>Abstract Classes solve the problem of wide tables by giving each model its own table and connecting them via an Abstract Base Model - the parent class cannot be instantiated and must be subclassed to be utilized. Where the entire hierarchy was represented in a single table in STI, the opposite is true using abstract classes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span work="" sans";"=""><span>This gives us the ability to separate unique attributes to distinct tables, but now we have the opposite problem - repetitive columns. The</span> 
</span><span>author</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>and</span> 
</span><span>title</span><span work="" sans";"=""> <span>columns will have to be included in all subclasses. We have also lost the ability to query across the entire hierarchy (i.e.</span> 
</span><span>Posts.all</span><span work="" sans";"=""><span>), making our newsfeed unnecessarily cumbersome.</span> 
</span></p></div> 
 <p><a id="1980528968"><img src="https://lirp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-02%2Bat%2B11.06.37%2BAM-1920w.png" alt="" id="1509483609" data-dm-image-path="https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/8a8eebaa/dms3rep/multi/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-08-02%2Bat%2B11.06.37%2BAM.png" onerror="handleImageLoadError(this)"></a>

<b>Summary</b>: In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like "the universal property of products" in working Haskell code. A rough list of topics includes: 
</p><ol>
<li>Sets, types, categories, functors, natural transformations</li>
<li>Universal constructions and associated data types</li>
<li>Adjunctions and cartesian closed categories</li>
<li>Algebras, catamorphisms, anamorphisms</li>
<li>Monads, comonads, Kleisli arrows</li>
<li>Monoids, monoidal categories, lax monoidal functors, applicatives</li>
<li>Profunctors, (co)ends, optics</li>
</ol>
<b>We will assume no background knowledge on behalf of the student</b>, starting from scratch on both the programming and mathematics.

ULA kicked the weekend off with a Delta IV Heavy launch of an NRO spy satellite. The aging heavy lifter, which will be phased out and replaced by <a href="https://www.ulalaunch.com/rockets/vulcan-centaur" target="_blank">Vulcan</a> over the next few years, had a <a href="https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1299623698090135552" target="_blank">T-3 sec hotfire abort</a> complete with a dramatic fireball (<a href="https://youtu.be/1jkjgo0Cs_8" target="_blank">video</a>). The rocket and payload are undamaged, but launch is delayed a week or more while expendable ground systems are replaced. Next up was SpaceX, launching <a href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/saocom-1.htm" target="_blank">SAOCOM-1B</a> into a polar orbit, the <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2020/08/spacex-polar-cape-50-years/" target="_blank">first such southward flight path from Florida since 1969</a> when <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/herd-shot-around-the-world-the-last-east-coast-polar-launch/article/567614" target="_blank">booster debris landed on Cuba</a> and <a href="https://www.mapfreglobalrisks.com/risks/images/Seguros_de_satelites_ENU_tcm1366-435032.pdf" target="_blank">killed a cow named Rufina</a> 🐮. Returning to this flight path was only possible due to the Falcon 9’s automated self-destruct systems—rocket exhaust in this flight path can block manually radioed abort messages. This launch was also temporarily halted due to its overflight of ULA’s aborted NROL-44 payload (expensive!) and required last minute approval from the NRO. To cap the weekend off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/completed-missions/i-cant-believe-its-not-optical/" target="_blank">Rocket Lab returned to flight with their 14th mission</a> (and announced that they will be conducting a first soft ocean splashdown of the booster for their 17th mission). Their&nbsp;<em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Optical</em> mission was a dedicated launch for <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/technology" target="_blank">Capella Space</a>, a startup focused on capturing 0.5 m resolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">synthetic aperture radar</a> (SAR) data as a service, the first of an eight satellite constellation. (<em>Ed., amusingly, this satellite was originally supposed to launch as a rideshare with SAOCOM-1B, but when that mission was delayed, Capella switched to Rocket Lab, which was then delayed by a July 4th failure, eventually launching just a few hours after the original mission. You just can’t get ahead. </em>🤷‍♂️)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#etc">¶</a><strong id="etc">Etc.</strong></p><ul><li>Explore Mars has <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/H2MR_2020_Web_v1.pdf" target="_blank">released their annual Humans to Mars report</a> detailing progress towards human exploration of the planet in the 2030s.</li><li>The US Department of Education has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/" target="_blank">announced a CubeSat mission design and prototyping challenge for High School students</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>By now, we all have learned to work with Zoom, GMeet, and other online tools. But what’s going on in the event industry? How do organizers attract speakers and grow their audience for online events? I interviewed Oli Makhasoeva – the main organizer of the biggest Haskell online event, Haskell Love Conference, in which <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-to-core">our developer Vlad had a chance to participate in</a>.</em></p><p><em>We talk about their experience organizing Haskell Love, how they kept it accessible for developers of all levels, and what things one should definitely keep in mind when organizing an online conference.</em></p><p><strong>– Hi Oli, first of all, thank you for organizing the biggest Haskell online event! How did it go from your point of view?</strong></p><p>Thank you! We were relatively lucky; no major incidents, although we had some technical challenges. On the first day, we were unable to use our remote desktop, but we were fortunate enough to have a backup. Otherwise, the conference went amazing: a lot of participation from the audience, endless chats; the statistics say we had more than 2000 unique attendees. Many people reached out directly and thanked us for the event – the Haskell community is truly friendly and welcoming. We were happy to see people having conversations during the event at the Hallway track: not only about Haskell, but also about technology and life in general.</p><p><strong>– Tell us about your team of organizers. How did you decide to work together and create the Haskell Love Conference?</strong></p><p>I am proud to say it’s a women organized conference! Most of us know each other for quite a while, from university times. We have Elena who is responsible for planning, Ida who held communications, Margarita worked with sponsors. All of them are professionals, and I am happy to have them. What’s also important, our volunteers had a wide variety of skills and did an amazing job staffing the conference and inspiring others.</p><p>The idea to organize Haskell Love came after we organized the Scala Love conference together. We thought – why not spread the love further to other communities? To achieve this goal, we started a company called <a href="https://konfy.care/">Konfy</a>. Our motto is “Konfy - make your conference comfortable”. Our conferences will always be virtual and free to attend. &lt;3
<img src="https://serokell.io/files/nf/nfjjia3k.oli.png" alt="Oli Makhasoeva"></p><p><strong>– The website says that the conference accepts people with monad-o-phobia. ;) How do you make Haskell events exciting and accessible for everyone, no matter the level of experience the audience has?</strong></p><p>Our program committee worked hard on making sure we included talks of different levels. However, we did not properly promote the level of the talks. We should have tagged all the talks and let people know the levels of the sessions. Action item for the next conference is created! We know how to make it better :)</p><p><strong>– What are the main pros and cons of online conferences vs. offline ones? Are there any specific things you did to make the online conference feel more like the offline one?</strong></p><p>Unlike offline ones, online conferences are accessible from everywhere to anyone with the internet (we even provided a low res streaming option because it was requested by someone with a weak internet connection). You can cover multiple time zones! No dietary restriction problems! Zero CO<sub>2</sub> footprint! And a bigger audience for sponsors! :) These are the advantages of virtual events.</p><p>At an offline event, we gather people in a conference room. You go to a closed place, focus on a speaker, and emerge with new insights. In the case of online events, you think: “I’ll watch a talk and do my other stuff so I don’t lose time.” But let’s be honest, it is harder to concentrate on an FP-oriented talk when you do something simultaneously. To help people to focus and to make our conference feel more like the offline one, we are trying to create an interactive and engaging environment at everyone’s home. That is, we are trying to immerse the person into the atmosphere of the conference with Q&amp;A rooms, the Hallway track, and the Twitter live stream. According to the feedback we got, we didn’t fail, but there is room for improvement.</p><p><strong>– The conference featured many impressive names such as Philip Wadler, Simon Peyton Jones, and others. How did you gather so many bright minds in one place?</strong></p><p>The Haskell community is full of enthusiasts who are willing to spend their time on a free conference and help the community. Speakers were awesome and supported our desire to gather Haskellers from around the world (also, they wanted to get our avatar 😉).</p><p><strong>– What is the most challenging thing in organizing an event like that?</strong></p><p>Building a flow for attendees: Q&amp;A sessions, the Hallway track, announcements, participation, how to move between them, and where to find information about each activity. We still need to improve that part a lot: people were confused by time zones, it wasn’t easy for them to keep track of so many places, etc.</p><p><strong>– To finish it up: what would be one piece of advice you would give to all who want to organize their own FP event?</strong></p><p>Indeed, it was challenging, and we had to scramble, so we’d like to share what we learned in order to help others who are thinking about whether and how to host large events in the coming months: facilitation is the key. Investing in tools to make the sessions as interactive as possible, call-outs for questions before/during, live polls, etc. Don’t let people be silent and just watch a video, make an experience where many people get the feel of a community. If you need help with organizing an online event, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@konfy.care">info@konfy.care</a>!</p><p>Many thanks to all who participated in this conference, we enjoyed it a lot and will come back next year! Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_haskellove">Twitter</a> to be up to date with our plans. And don’t be upset if you missed the event, the videos are already out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Konfy">our Youtube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p><img src="https://www.karimarttila.fi/img/2020-09-01-using-clojure-in-command-line-with-babashka_img_1.png" alt="Ordinary Clojure code"></p>

<p><em>Ordinary Clojure code - can be run in REPL or in command line with Babashka (the whole file can be found <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">here</a> )</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I never bothered to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> so that I could be really fluent with it. If I needed anything beyond basic Bash stuff I immediately used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> in command-line scripting.</p>

<p>I’m currently implementing my Clojure simple server again, this time using the <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/integrant">Integrant</a> library. In this new version, I implemented three data stores: CSV, AWS DynamoDB, and Postgres. I had already implemented importing development data into DynamoDB (using Python), this time I used <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/Babashka">Babashka</a> to import development data into Postgres - mainly just to have an excuse to try if I could replace Python with Clojure when scripting something with Bash.</p>

<p>The scripts can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure">Clojure git</a> repo in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>.</p>

<h3 id="developing-with-babashka">Developing with Babashka</h3>

<p>The really neat thing with Babashka is that you can develop your Babashka scripts as part of your Clojure project, or independently but using your favorite Clojure IDE. The picture above shows Clojure code in my favorite Clojure IDE, <a href="https://cursive-ide.com/">Cursive</a>. I have the Clojure code that imports data into the Postgres database in directory <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/tree/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres">postgres</a>, so I have the following extra path in my <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/deps.edn">deps.edn</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span> </span><span>:postgres</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:extra-paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"postgres"</span><span>]}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the nice thing is that I can develop the Clojure code as part of project’s other Clojure code. Let’s first create a short bash script that tells Babashka to run your Clojure code with a flag so that we know in the Clojure code when we are running the code using Babashka or using Clojure IDE REPL (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">run-bb-load-data.sh</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#/bin/bash</span>

<span>export </span><span>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span>simpleserver
<span>export </span><span>RUNNING_BB</span><span>=</span>TRUE
bb bb_postgres.clj
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The flag is the <code>RUNNING_BB</code> export above.</p>

<p>Then in the Clojure code we have a top level form <code>(run-me)</code> in the namespace (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/bb_postgres.clj">bb_postgres.clj</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-me</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
  </span><span>"Loads data only if running from Babashka script which sets the environment variable.
  We don't want the repl to load the data when reloading the namespace.
  In repl experimentation use the rich comment below."</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getenv</span><span> </span><span>"RUNNING_BB"</span><span>)]</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>running-bb?</span><span> </span><span>"TRUE"</span><span>)</span><span>
      </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>))))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>run-me</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. when reloading the namespace REPL runs the code but if the flag is not set it doesn’t actually do anything - it imports the code only if we are running the code using Babashka. The reason for this is that when I reload the namespace as part of my Clojure workflow I don’t want the data import to happen. For development purposes to test importing data, or any other function, I have a <code>rich comment</code> at the end of the file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>comment</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>"dev-resources/data"</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-raw-products</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>get-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>do</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-products!</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>(</span><span>delete-product-groups!</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>load-users</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>vals</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>get-users</span><span> </span><span>data-dir</span><span>)))</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>import-data</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>db-get-all-products</span><span>)</span><span>
  </span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>comment</code> block is here so that REPL does not run this code when reloading, of course. The function calls you see inside the comment block are just experiments added in no particular order. I can send any of these forms individually to be evaluated in the REPL - a typical Clojure trick when developing with REPL.</p>

<h3 id="babashka-use-cases">Babashka Use Cases</h3>

<p>I really like the idea that I can now use Clojure in shell scripting. Of course I could use Clojure in shell scripting also without Babashka but JVM boot takes quite a long time which makes testing of the script in command line a bit painful. Not so with Babashka - Babashka boots lightning fast:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>λ&gt; <span>time </span>bb <span>'(println "Hello world!")'</span>
Hello world!

real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.003s
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The use cases using Babashka in my personal scripting probably is a bit like I used Babashka to import data into the Postgres database in this exercise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>command</span><span>]</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>insert-product-group!</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>product-group</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>println</span><span> </span><span>"Inserting product-group: "</span><span> </span><span>product-group</span><span>)</span><span>

    </span><span>(</span><span>run-sql</span><span> </span><span>command</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>load-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>product-groups</span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>doseq</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>pg</span><span> </span><span>product-groups</span><span>]</span><span>

                               </span><span>raw</span><span>))]</span><span>
    </span><span>product-groups</span><span>))</span><span>

</span><span>(</span><span>defn</span><span> </span><span>import-data</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>

    </span><span>(</span><span>load-product-groups</span><span> </span><span>product-groups</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>;...</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I.e. parsing CSV, transforming data, and then call some program with the transformed data, possibly read what was returned and do other stuff. You could possibly do all this using plain old Bash but I never bothered to learn Bash in that level that I can do more than test some flags and call other programs using Bash.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-babashka-script-in-this-exercise">How Do I Use the Babashka Script in This Exercise?</h3>

<p>I used Babashka to load development data into the Postgres data store. During development I built a custom Postgres image and provided a <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">Just</a> recipe to start the data store (file <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/Justfile">Justfile</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Start local postgres</span>
@postgres:
    <span>cd </span>postgres <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ./run-docker-compose.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-docker-compose.sh">run-docker-compose.sh</a> starts the Postgres docker container, creates the schema and finally calls <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/postgres/run-bb-load-data.sh">./run-bb-load-data.sh</a> which loads the data into the development Postgres data store:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>"NOTE: Remember to destroy the container if running again!"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting docker compose..."</span>
docker-compose <span>-p</span> ss-postgres <span>-f</span> docker-compose-setup-local-postgres.yml up <span>-d</span>
<span>sleep </span>5
<span>echo</span> <span>"Creating Simple Server schemas..."</span>
./create-schema.sh
<span>sleep </span>1
<span>echo</span> <span>"Loading data..."</span>
./run-bb-load-data.sh
<span>sleep </span>1

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="clojure-babashka-vs-python-in-shell-scripting">Clojure (Babashka) vs Python in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p>Let’s finally compare Python and Clojure (Babashka) when doing some Linux shell scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Easiness</strong>. Both languages are pretty easy and fast to work if you have used them. Developing Python scripts is pretty fast - you just run the script in command line. Working with Clojure has one additional plus: you can use the Clojure REPL.</p>

<p><strong>Library support</strong>: Python wins. When you are scripting in Python and you realize that it would be nice e.g. to use some AWS library - just use it (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/karimarttila/clojure/blob/master/webstore-demo/integrant-simple-server/dynamodb/pysrc/table_importer.py">table_importer.py</a> - the AWS <a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> library). The library support for Babashka is not as extensive, of course - but Babashka supports quite many namespaces outside <code>clojure.core</code> and also some additional libraries: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka#built-in-namespaces">Babashka built-in namespaces</a> - keep eye on that page, maybe Babashka library support is growing in the future!</p>

<p>So, the library support might not be as good as with Python. But I really do love Clojure and if I’m implementing apps using Clojure it is really nice to do some ad hoc scripting using Babashka.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It’s nice to have another scripting tool in my toolbox: <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">Babashka</a>. Time will tell if I start using Clojure instead of Python as my preferred scripting language, thanks to Babashka. At least in this exercise Babashka did really well.</p>

                <!-- Toc if any -->

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I started investigating full-text search options recently. The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When I was 15</strong>, one of my closest friends died unexpectedly. Our physics teacher broke the news to me after Iâ€™d sat an exam, having wondered all the way through why my friend wasnâ€™t there doing the same. I still donâ€™t have the words to describe how I felt: it was something approaching shock, distress, disorientation. I didnâ€™t know what to think, much less what to do. I spent many nights awake and many days in a daze.</p>
<p>Fifteen years later, when I was in graduate school, another friend died suddenly, a man I loved very much. I remember checking my phone and finding out, to my dismay, via text message. But while my initial response was much the same as before, there was a palpable difference in how I felt later on. While I was again surprised and saddened, I was much less disoriented than Iâ€™d been as a teenager. I could still think, and I could still get things done. It seemed to me that Iâ€™d become better at living with loss.</p>
<p>You might think that the reason for this difference is obvious â€“ I was older, and Iâ€™d had more experience in coping with death. But raw experience alone isnâ€™t enough: what matters more is whether we learn from experience. And learning from experience, especially an experience as difficult as the death of a loved one, can involve quite a lot. Among other things, it can involve creativity.</p>
<p>This claim might seem surprising. After all, creativity is often associated with the idea of a lone creative genius, an individual who not only excels at what they do, but also transforms the world in the process. Further, even if we donâ€™t limit ourselves to romantic or heroic perspectives on the nature and value of creativity, itâ€™s commonly thought that creativity at least aims at novelty or originality.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about creativity isnâ€™t universal. The <a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-complete-works-of-zhuangzi/9780231164740"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a> (èŽŠå­�), a classical Chinese philosophical and literary text, provides a different perspective. On one interpretation, creativity isnâ€™t conceived as aiming at novelty or originality, but rather <em>integration</em>. Instead of aiming at something new, it aims at something that combines well with the situation of which itâ€™s a part.</p>
<p>The story of Wheelwright Pian, from a chapter of the Zhuangzi known as the <em>Tian Dao</em> (å¤©é�“), meaning â€˜Heavenâ€™s Wayâ€™ or â€˜The Way of Heavenâ€™, effectively illustrates this perspective on creativity as it pertains to artists or artisans. In this short vignette, a wheelwright known as Pian (æ‰�) tells a duke that the book of sagesâ€™ advice heâ€™s reading is nothing but â€˜chaff and dregsâ€™. Angered, the duke demands an explanation. The wheelwright responds that, at least concerning his craft, he can create what he does only because heâ€™s developed a â€˜knackâ€™ for it that canâ€™t be wholly conveyed in words. If the blows of his mallet are too gentle, his chisel slides and wonâ€™t take hold. If theyâ€™re too hard, it bites in and wonâ€™t budge. â€˜Not too gentle, not too hard â€“ you can get it in your hand and feel it in your mind,â€™ he says. â€˜So, Iâ€™ve gone along for 70 years and at my age Iâ€™m still chiselling wheels. When the men of old died, they took with them the things that couldnâ€™t be handed down. So, what you are reading there must be nothing but the chaff and dregs of the men of old.â€™</p>
<p>Although heâ€™s a â€˜lowlyâ€™ craftsperson, the wheelwright has something important to teach the duke. Heâ€™s been creating wheels by hand for many years and has developed an ability to act and to execute his craft in an integrated manner that canâ€™t be fully captured through an algorithmic list of instructions. He responds to precise particularities in the wood, his tools and his body to create what he wants â€“ something he doesnâ€™t accomplish by imposing a plan.</p>
<p>Striving for originality can be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results</p>
<p>The sagesâ€™ advice for living well is therefore mere â€˜dregsâ€™ if itâ€™s interpreted as instructions that one can simply read and then complete. Living well in general involves much more than this; namely, a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the hard and the soft, as well as the learned and the spontaneous, the active and the passive, and even the unproductive and the productive â€“ all of which apply in the case of carving wheels, as well as elsewhere. In other words, living well involves creativity.</p>
<p>This kind of creativity isnâ€™t taken to aim at novelty or originality as such. The wheelwright is presented as creative not because of anything to do with his, or his projectsâ€™, novelty or originality, but instead because of his ability to create wheels in a sensitive, responsive and â€“ crucially â€“ well-integrated manner: one not learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity.</p>
<p>We can use the story of Wheelwright Pian to better understand why learning to live with loss is a creative pursuit. Although thereâ€™s an abundance of books dispensing advice on how to do so, ultimately learning to live with death is a deeply personal endeavour that â€“ like carving wheels â€“ canâ€™t be fully captured through a programmatic set of directions. We must respond to precise particularities of our situation (concerning our thoughts, feelings and overall circumstances) to create what we want to create (such as a sense of peace or closure). This isnâ€™t something that can be accomplished by imposing a plan, even if we make various provisional and highly malleable â€˜plansâ€™ on the fly as we go along.</p>
<p>Moreover, in working through our thoughts, feelings and circumstances in all their particularities, itâ€™s not that weâ€™re doing anything all that different from what countless others have had to do as theyâ€™ve learned to cope with loss. Nonetheless â€“ again, like carving wheels â€“ itâ€™s plausibly a creative activity, in that it involves a spontaneous integration between contrasting types such as the grieving and the celebratory, the resentful and the grateful, the distressed and the joyous. The ability to live with death, too, in a sensitive, responsive, and well-integrated manner isnâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via engaging in sustained, spontaneous activity. Indeed, even the philosopher Zhuangzi himself can be understood as engaging in such a creative process after the death of his own wife in chapter 18 of the text, the <em>Zhi Le</em> (è‡³æ¨‚), meaning â€˜Perfect Happinessâ€™ or â€˜Perfect Joyâ€™.</p>
<p><strong>This way of thinking</strong> about creativity has a variety of other potential benefits. First, even if creativity were taken to aim at originality, de-emphasising originality might ironically result in greater creativity. This is because striving for originality can actually be counterproductive when it comes to achieving genuinely fresh results: if we focus on the task of achieving something original, weâ€™ll explore only the range of possibilities deemed sufficiently likely to yield that result, leaving out a lot that could have contributed to achieving something original.</p>
<p>But imagine instead that we worked with idea that creativity wasnâ€™t about novelty. That doesnâ€™t mean weâ€™d have to give up the value of originality entirely, but rather see it as one of a range of possible outcomes. Casting a wider net in this way might hence make creativity (whatever it involves) easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on integration could encourage us to better understand creative agents as being intimately connected with, and products of, their environments. This would broaden our notion of creativity in a way that might allow us to see creativity demanded in a greater range of activities. After all, many of lifeâ€™s activities, from the mundane to the meaningful, arenâ€™t learned by rote, but rather via spontaneous action that integrates contrasting aspects. Just for starters, additional examples might include getting along with oneâ€™s family, building relationships with colleagues and organising oneâ€™s finances.</p>
<p>This alternative perspective on creativity might help us to see it as an everyday phenomenon in which we all participate â€“ rather than an extraordinary talent or gift that only a few enjoy. And it might also allow us to make sense of the idea of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43893-1_19#:~:text=As%20an%20art%20practice%2C%20calligraphy,Daoist%20aesthetic%20concerns%20discussed%20here.&amp;text=The%20aesthetic%20of%20the%20everyday,and%20the%20need%20for%20imagination">living creatively</a>: of an integrated life, lived spontaneously, in which all of lifeâ€™s contrasting aspects can be arranged to form a rich and variegated whole.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="about-the-course"> About the course</h2>
<p>This is an online course on Functional Programming that uses the Haskell programming language. You can study at your own pace. All the material and exercises are openly available.</p>
<p>This course is aimed at beginners who wish to learn functional programming, but also people who have experience with functional programming and want to learn Haskell in particular. The course assumes no previous knowledge, but knowing at least one programming language beforehand will make the course easier.</p>
<p>Working on the exercises involves knowing how to use the command line, and basic usage of the Git version control system.</p>
<p>This is part 1 of a two-part course. Part 1 covers the basics of Haskell syntax and features. You will learn about recursion, higher-order functions, algebraic data types and some of Haskell’s advanced features. However, part 1 will stick to pure functional programming, without side-effects. I/O and Monads will be introduced in part 2.</p>
<h3 id="course-structure"> Course structure</h3>
<p>The course is split into 8 lectures. They are roughly the same size, but some lectures have more material than others. Each lecture set ends with 10-30 small programming exercises on the topics of the lecture.</p>
<h3 id="administrative-information-grading"> Administrative information, grading</h3>
<p>The course is worth 5 ECTS credits.</p>
<p>Grading is Fail/Pass/5. To pass the course you must complete at least 50% of each lecture’s exercises. A special grade of 5 is awarded to those who complete 99% of all exercises.</p>

<h2 id="haskell"> Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> – the basic building blocks of programs are functions. Functions can return functions and take functions as arguments. Also, the only looping construct in Haskell is recursion.</p>
<p><strong>Pure</strong> - Haskell functions are pure, that is, they don’t have side effects. Side effects mean things like reading a file, printing out text, or changing global variables. All inputs to a function must be in its arguments, and all outputs from a function in its return value. This sounds restricting, but makes reasoning about programs easier, and allows for more optimizations by the compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Lazy</strong> - values are only evaluated when they are needed. This makes it possible to work with infinite data structures, and also makes pure programs more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - every Haskell value and expression has a type. The compiler checks the types at compile-time and guarantees that no type errors can happen at runtime. This means no AttributeErrors (a la Python), ClassCastExceptions (a la Java) or segmentation faults (a la C). The Haskell type system is very powerful and can help you design better programs.</p>
<p><strong>Type inferred</strong> - in addition to checking the types, the compiler can deduce the types for most programs. This makes working with a strongly typed language easier. Indeed, most Haskell functions can be written completely without types. However programmers can still give functions and values type annotations to make finding type errors easier. Type annotations also make reading programs easier.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage-collected</strong> - like most high-level languages these days, Haskell has automatic memory management via garbage collection. This means that the programmer doesn’t need to worry about allocating or freeing memory, the language runtime handles all of it automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Compiled</strong> - even though we mostly use Haskell via the interactive GHCi environment on this course, Haskell is a compiled language. Haskell programs can be compiled to very efficient binaries, and the GHC compiler is very good at optimising functional code into performant machine code.</p>
<p>You’ll learn what these terms mean in practice during this course. Don’t worry if some of them sound abstract right now.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Functional_programming">The Haskell Wiki page on Functional programming</a>.</p>
<h3 id="features"> Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a showcase of some of the Haskell’s cool features:</p>
<p><strong>Higher-order functions</strong> – functions can take functions as arguments:</p>

<p>This results in <code>[3,6]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous functions aka lambdas</strong> – you can define single-use helper functions without giving them a name</p>

<p>This results in <code>["abc","ef"]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Partial application</strong> – you can define new functions by giving another function only some of the arguments it needs. For example this multiplies all elements in a list by 3:</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic datatypes</strong> – a syntax for defining datatypes that can contain a number of different cases:</p>

<p>Now the type <code>Shape</code> can have values like <code>Point</code>, <code>Rectangle 3 6</code> and <code>Circle 5</code></p>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> – defining functions based on cases that correspond to your data definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Lists</strong> – Unlike many languages, Haskell has a concise built-in syntax for lists. Lists can be built from other lists using <em>list comprehensions</em>. Here’s a snippet that generates names of even length from a set of options for first and last names:</p>

<p>This results in <code>["EvaSmith","EvaOdd","MikeWood"]</code>. Thanks to the laziness of Haskell, we can even create so-called <em>infinite lists</em>:</p>

<p>The first ten prime numbers can be then obtained by evaluating</p>

<p>This evaluates to <code>[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Parameterized types</strong> – you can define types that are parameterized by other types. For example <code>[Int]</code> is a list of <code>Int</code>s and <code>[Bool]</code> is a list of booleans. You can define typed functions that work on all kinds of lists, for example <code>reverse</code> has the type <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> which means it takes a list containing any type <code>a</code>, and returns a list of the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Type classes</strong> – another form of polymorphism where you can give a function a different implementation depending on the arguments’ types. For example the <code>Show</code> type class defines the function <code>show</code> that can convert types of various values to strings. The <code>Num</code> type class defines arithmetic operators like <code>+</code> that work on all number types (<code>Int</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Complex</code>, …).</p>
<h3 id="some-history"> Some History</h3>
<p>A brief timeline of Haskell:</p>
<ul>
<li>1930s: Lamba Calculus</li>
<li>1950s-1970s: Lisp, Pattern Matching, Scheme, ML</li>
<li>1978 John Backus: <a href="https://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/backus_turingaward_lecture.pdf">Can programming be liberated from the von Neumann style?</a></li>
<li>1987 A decision was made to unify the field of pure functional languages</li>
<li>1990 Haskell 1.0</li>
<li>1991 Haskell 1.1 (let-syntax, sections)</li>
<li>1992 Haskell 1.2, GHC</li>
<li>1996 Haskell 1.3 (Monads, do-syntax, type system improvements)</li>
<li>1999 Haskell 98</li>
<li>2000’s: GHC development, many extensions to the language</li>

<li>2010’s: GHC development, Haskell Platform, Haskell Stack</li>
</ul>
<p>The word ‘haskel’ means wisdom in Hebrew, but the name of the Haskell programming language comes from the logician Haskell Curry. The name Haskell comes from the Old Norse words áss (god) and ketill (helmet).</p>

<h2 id="running-haskell"> Running Haskell</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get Haskell is to install the <code>stack</code> tool, see <a href="http://haskellstack.org/">http://haskellstack.org</a>. The exercises on this course are intended to work with Stack, so you should use it for now.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in what Stack is, and how it relates to other Haskell tools like Cabal and GHC, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Cabal-and-Stack-in-Haskell-projects-Which-one-do-you-recommend-and-why">read more here</a> or <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/faq/">here</a>. We’ll get back to Haskell packages and using them in detail in part 2 of the course.</p>
<p>For now, after installing Stack, just run <code>stack ghci</code> to get an interactive Haskell environment.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start"> Let’s start!</h2>
<p>GHCi is the interactive Haskell interpreter. Here’s an example session:</p>
<pre><code>$ stack ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.1: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude&gt; 1+1
2
Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"
Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"
Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :type tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]
Prelude&gt; :type tail
tail :: [a] -&gt; [a]
Prelude&gt; :quit
Leaving GHCi.</code></pre>
<p>By the way, the first time you run <code>stack ghci</code> it will download GHC and some libraries, so don’t worry if you see some output and have to wait for a while before getting the <code>Prelude&gt;</code> prompt.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this. Don’t worry if you don’t understand things yet, this is just a first brush with expressions and types.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; 1+1
2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Prelude&gt;</code> is the GHCi prompt. It indicates we can use the functions from the Haskell base library called Prelude. We evaluate 1 plus 1, and the result is 2.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; "asdf"
"asdf"</code></pre>
<p>Here we evaluate a string literal, and the result is the same string.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; reverse "asdf"
"fdsa"</code></pre>
<p>Here we compute the reverse of a string by applying the function <code>reverse</code> to the value <code>"asdf"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; :type "asdf"
"asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>In addition to evaluating expressions we can also ask for their type with the <code>:type</code> (abbreviated <code>:t</code>) GHCi command. The type of <code>"asdf"</code> is a list of characters. Commands that start with <code>:</code> are part of the user interface of GHCi, not part of the Haskell language.</p>
<pre><code>Prelude&gt; tail "asdf"
"sdf"
Prelude&gt; :t tail "asdf"
tail "asdf" :: [Char]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>tail</code> function works on lists and returns all except the first element of the list. Here we see <code>tail</code> applied to <code>"asdf"</code>. We also check the type of the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Even in Go, concurrency is still not easy (with an example)</h2>

	<p><small>September  1, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Go is famous for making concurrency easy, through good language
support for <a href="https://golangbot.com/goroutines/">goroutines</a>. Except
what Go makes easy is only one level of concurrency, the nuts and
bolts level of making your code do things concurrently and communicating
back and forth through channels. Making it do the right things
concurrently is still up to you, and unfortunately Go doesn't
currently provide a lot of standard library support for correctly
implemented standard concurrency patterns.</p>

<p>For example, one common need is for a limited amount of concurrency;
you want to do several things at once, but only so many of them.
At the moment this is up to you to implement on top of goroutines,
channels, and things like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/"><code>sync</code></a>
package. This is not as easy as it looks, and quite competent people
can make mistakes here. As it happens, I have an example ready to
hand today.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google/gops">Gops</a> is a convenient command to
list (and diagnose) Go processes that are currently running on your
system. Among other things, it'll tell you which version of Go they
were compiled with, which is handy if you want to see if you have out
of date binaries that should be rebuilt and redeployed. One of the
things <code>gops</code> needs to do is look at all of the Go processes on your
system, which it does concurrently. However, it doesn't want to look
at too many processes at once, because <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/pull/118">that can cause problems with
file descriptor limits</a>. This
is a classic case of <em>limited concurrency</em>.</p>

<p>Gops implements this at the moment with code in <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/blob/6fb0d860e5fa50629405d9e77e255cd32795967e/goprocess/gp.go#L29">goprocess.FindAll()</a>
that looks like this, in somewhat sketched and reduced form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>func FindAll() []P {
   pss, err := ps.Processes()
   [...]
   found := make(chan P)
   limitCh := make(chan struct{}, concurrencyProcesses)

   for _, pr := range pss {
      limitCh &lt;- struct{}{}
      pr := pr
      go func() {
         defer func() { &lt;-limitCh }()
         [... get a P with some error checking ...]
         found &lt;- P
      }()
   }
   [...]

   var results []P
   for p := range found {
      results = append(results, p)
   }
   return results
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(In the real code there's a WaitGroup for coordination, and the
<code>found</code> channel gets closed appropriately.)</p>

<p>How this works is clear, and is a standard pattern (covered in eg
Go 101's <a href="https://go101.org/article/channel-use-cases.html">Channel Use Cases</a>). We use a
buffered channel to provide a limited number of tokens; sending a
value into the channel implicitly takes a token (and blocks if the
token supply is exhausted), while receiving a value from it puts a
token back in. We take a token before we start a new goroutine, and
the goroutine releases the token when it's done.</p>

<p>Except that <a href="https://github.com/google/gops/issues/123">this code has a bug if there are too many processes
to examine</a>. Even knowing
that there is a bug in this code, it may not be obvious.</p>

<p>The bug is that the goroutines only receive from <code>limitCh</code> to release
their token after sending their result to the unbuffered <code>found</code>
channel, while the main code only starts receiving from <code>found</code>
after running through the entire loop, and <strong>the main code takes
the token in the loop and blocks if no tokens are available</strong>. So
if you have too many processes to go through, you start N goroutines,
they all block trying to write to <code>found</code> and don't receive from
<code>limitCh</code>, and the main <code>for</code> loop blocks trying to send to <code>limitCh</code>
and never reaches the point where it starts receiving from <code>found</code>.</p>

<p>At one level, this bug is a very fragile bug; it only exists because
of multiple circumstances. If the goroutines took the token by
sending to <code>limitCh</code> instead of the main <code>for</code> loop doing it, the
bug would not exist; the main <code>for</code> loop would start them all, many
would stop, and then it would go on to receive from <code>found</code> so that
they could receive from <code>limitCh</code> and release their token so other
goroutines would run. If the goroutines received from <code>limitCh</code> to
release their token before sending to <code>found</code>, it wouldn't exist
(but because of error handling, it's simpler and more reliable to
do the receive in a <code>defer</code>). And if the entire <code>for</code> loop was in
an additional goroutine, the main code would go on to receive from
<code>found</code> and unblock completed goroutines to release their tokens,
so the fact that the <code>for</code> loop was blocked waiting to send to
<code>limitCh</code> wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>At another level, this shows how concurrency is not easy as easy
as it looks in Go. All you need is one mistake and things skid to
a halt, and all of the code involved can look good to a casual
examination. Getting concurrency correct is simply hard for people
(we can debate about why, but I think that it is is very clear).</p>

<p>(I'm sure that the people who wrote and approved the change that
added this concurrency limiting code to gops were good programmers.
A tricky case still tripped them up, passing all of their scrutiny.
Even when I knew that there was a concurrency problem in the code
and where it was (because my <code>gops</code> was hanging all of a sudden,
and <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a> told me where
everything was stuck), it still took me some time to see what the
exact problem was.)</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Flash the Pi</h3>
<p>You'll need to flash Raspberry Pi OS on a fresh SD Card.</p>
<p>Either with <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">Balena Etcher</a> or the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>. The procedure is extremely straight forward.</p>
<p>Just go through the steps and you have Rasperry Pi OS installed on a SD card.</p>
<h3>Set up Wi-Fi connectivity</h3>
<p>To get the Pi connect to your Wi-Fi, you'll need to create a file called <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> in the SD card.</p>
<p>The contents of <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> should look like this (configure it accordingly):</p>
<pre><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
ap_scan=1
update_config=1

network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="YOUR_WIFI_ACCESS_POINT"
  psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enable SSH access</h3>
<p>To enable SSH access (with the user <code>pi</code> and password <code>raspberry</code>), simply create an empty file (without extension), called <code>ssh</code> in the SD card.</p>
<h3>Enable Camera module</h3>
<p>To enable to camera module, you can configure it through the <code>raspi-config</code> utility.</p>
<p>But also with the file <code>config.txt</code> in SD card.</p>
<p>Open it and add the following to it:</p>
<pre><code>start_x=1
gpu_mem=128
</code></pre>
<p>Just make sure there are no other occurrencies for <code>start_x</code> or <code>gpu_mem</code></p>

<h2>Take image with raspistill</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><code>raspistill</code> is the command line tool for capturing still photographs with the camera module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to take a snapshot every x minutes using <code>raspistill</code></p>
<p>To take a single image, I'm using the following bash script called <code>/home/pi/take-snapshot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

DATE=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SNAPSHOTS_DIR=/home/pi/snapshots
SNAPSHOT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/$DATE.jpg"
CURRENT_PATH="$SNAPSHOTS_DIR/current.jpg"

echo "$DATE"
mkdir -p "$SNAPSHOTS_DIR"
echo "taking snapshot $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
raspistill \
    --width 1280 \
    --height 960 \
    --quality 100 \
    --output "$SNAPSHOT_PATH"
echo "snapshot saved $SNAPSHOT_PATH"

echo "adding watermark $SNAPSHOT_PATH"
cd $SNAPSHOTS_DIR
montage \
  -label "$DATE" \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH \
  -pointsize 30 \
  -gravity Center \
  -geometry +0+0 \
  $SNAPSHOT_PATH

cp $SNAPSHOT_PATH $CURRENT_PATH
</code></pre>
<p>This script will take a snapshot, name it in the format <code>%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ.jpg</code> and put it in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>At the end this photo is also watermarked using <code>montage</code> from the ImageMagick family.</p>
<h2>Schedule capture with crontab</h2>
<p>To take a photo every 5 minutes using the above script, you can set up a simple cron job for that.</p>
<p>Just run <code>crontab -e</code> to edit the cron schedules and add the following lines</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
*/5 * * * * sh /home/pi/take-snapshot &gt;&gt; /home/pi/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre>
<h2>Directory listing of snapshots</h2>
<p>You can expose a web server on port 80 to easily list all images (and time-lapses) taken in the folder <code>/home/pi/snapshots</code>.</p>
<p>Start the server at boot by adding the following to your crontab</p>
<pre><code>@reboot sudo python3 -m http.server --directory /home/pi/snapshots 80
</code></pre>
<h2>Create time-lapse with ffmpeg</h2>
<p>Taking a time-lapse for the day <code>2020-08-31</code> with ffmpeg is as easy as running</p>
<pre><code>cat 2020-08-31*.jpg | ffmpeg -r 10 -i - -c:v libx264 -vf "format=yuv420p,scale=1280:-2" time-lapse-2020-08-31.mp4
</code></pre>

<p>You can clone / fork the repo <a href="https://github.com/christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse">christian-fei/raspberry-pi-time-lapse</a> and create your first time-lapse in no time.</p>
<p>There are various scripts that simplify the steps above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>take-snapshot</code> to take a watermarked and timestamped photo in the folder <code>snapshots/</code></li>
<li><code>server</code> to start a HTTP server on port 80 listing all snapshots and time-lapses taken so far</li>
<li><code>rsync-snapshots</code> to sync the snapshots to from the Raspberry Pi to your PC</li>
<li><code>create-time-lapse</code> to create a time-lapse for a specific date</li>
<li><code>crontab</code> to schedule the snapshots and spin up the server</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Something my colleagues know well is how little I trust online tools like <a href="https://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, online JSON validators or online tooling in general, but it also bleeds into <a href="https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/08/zebqf/">comments I make online</a> and in my blog posts, too, and I thought I'd share a little bit of a reason as to why.</p><p>Instead of using an online service, I will reach for a way to run it locally, using whichever programming language toolchain I have available. But why? Why wouldn't I recommend something like jwt.io? Or an online JSON validator, especially if they boast client-side functionality, and mean I don't need things installed?</p><p>Let's start with a bit of background. Firstly, I'd just like to caveat this all with the note that <strong>I have no access to Production data, customer or otherwise</strong>. All of these examples are referencing Non-Production examples.</p><p>I also want to caveat this with the fact that this is <strong>not a personal attack</strong> on jwt.io. I am using them as an example as they're a well-known and well-used service, and I've seen issues with it before. Auth0 run it, and are probably one of the few companies we'd want to be running it. It's also <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io">Open Source</a> <em>but</em> one of the great difficulties of Web-hosted services are that we have no idea if the source code that we're told is being used is actually being used!</p><p>I'm currently working on the Open Banking platform for Capital One. We're fortunate to have very restricted access to Production, which makes things safer for everyone. One thing we strive to do is to treat Non-Production secrets like Production ones where possible - where we shouldn't have access to them at all, and shouldn't be sharing them with external services. Some of these Non-Production secrets may be usable outside of Capital One, for instance Open Banking Sandbox signing certificates.</p><p>We perform a fair bit of testing in our Non-Production environments and sometimes need to debug things, such as what's inside a JWT (as Open Banking introduces several places they're used). I've been burned a number of times by folks putting a Non-Production JWT or an Open Banking Sandbox certificate into jwt.io. Although Non-Production, these are sensitive in of themselves, as they have implementation details for our services, and as mentioned, certain things could be used outside of Capital One.</p><p>The biggest reason I hear from folks using online tooling is that it's easier, and that they'd rather do that than find out how to run it locally. I disagree with this, but am quite biased, as I often have a blog post for many of these common issues. I love sharing my blog with others and having a handy solution, or if I don't have an answer to a problem, I'll find out how and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/tags/blogumentation/">blogument it for later</a>. So I see that reaching for online tooling is more just because we've got folks who aren't aware of how they could do otherwise.</p><p>One great thing about removing the need for an online tool is that you can self-serve it once you have the tools locally. You can run it locally when you've got no internet (which isn't as much of an issue in these Coronavirus times) but also regardless of whether the upstream service is broken. You can use it with other i.e. command-line tooling, for instance how I've set up <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/dotfiles-arch/-/blob/master/terminal/home/bin/unpack">this command-line script</a> to handle a lot of common data formats I deal with and unpack them to a human-readable format.</p><p>But most importantly, by telling people to put sensitive data (such as credentials, configuration files, etc) it's a really dangerous lesson for our teams. We're teaching people to blindly trust arbitrary websites that they don't have any relationship with, nor have fully audited the source code, when posting potentially sensitive data.</p><p>I realise this may not be something you do when running it locally, but it's less likely for a well-known library running locally to need to reach outbound.</p><p>jwt.io is an interesting example, because although it boasts that it runs as a client-side solution, you may not have been aware that <a href="https://github.com/jsonwebtoken/jsonwebtoken.github.io/commit/b362ab19a9f37e337b5f8ea38987aa680aa6e0a9">until last September</a>, there were metrics being determined which although may have seemed innocent, show that it's easy for other functionality to be hidden in a seemingly client-side-only website. Unless you audit everything, every time, you're in a risky position where you may be leaking data you're not expecting to.</p><p>I feel that we can do something to help services that handle potentially sensitive data with helping educate the user that they should be more careful, because jwt.io's warning definitely doesn't help with folks who don't fully appreciate what the risk is if jwt.io isn't actually as trustworthy as the user thinks:</p><blockquote><p>Warning: JWTs are credentials, which can grant access to resources. Be careful where you paste them! We do not record tokens, all validation and debugging is done on the client side.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Am I maybe being a little too sensitive? Am I not being sensitive enough?</p><p>Edit: Based on some conversations being had in response to the post, I thought it'd mention I've written about how to <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/06/13/pretty-printing-jwt-openssl/">pretty-print a JWT locally with OpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/08/31/pretty-printing-jwt-ruby/">a Ruby alternative</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[The problem with C]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

September 2, 2020 | https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.causal.app/blog/cac-is-not-sales-marketing-expense">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note:&nbsp;this was originally published at </em><a href="https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/" target="_blank"><em>https://alexoppenheimer.substack.com/</em></a></p><p>Generally accepted accounting principles were designed to create a single standard for comparing any and all businesses using the same terms and metrics. This is a very powerful tool, but it is a clear exchange for breadth over specificity. As a result, the economic reality of a business will likely differ from what the accounting metrics represent. By looking at a subset of business models, we can improve specificity - terms like <em>ARR </em>and <em>GMV</em> are both examples of this. While these terms have their own challenges with definitions, I think most agree what they represent: ARR is annualized recurring revenue for SaaS companies, and GMV is gross merchandise/marketplace value for marketplace companies.</p><p>One of my favorite examples of this is CAC - customer acquisition cost. It’s relevant for both SaaS businesses and marketplaces. Average CAC is the cost to acquire a single customer and Total CAC is the full spend for a cohort of customers. So what is the difference between <strong>CAC</strong> and <strong>Sales &amp; Marketing</strong> expense? The truth is that Total CAC and S&amp;M over a given period of time <em>might </em>be the same. That being said, the usually differ by a <em>time offset </em>that depends on <strong><em>sales cycle length</em></strong>.</p><p>The critical distinction is <strong>sales cycle length</strong>. <em>Sales cycle is how long it takes for a customer to go from first contact to closing a deal</em>. We measure sales cycle by segment and can use simple reports in Salesforce or another CRM tool to figure out how long it takes on average for customers to move through the sales funnel. Generally sales opportunities begin as leads, some of those convert to <em>qualified for sales</em> and then some of those convert to <em>closed-won</em>. The Sales Funnel shows the volume and conversion at each step in the process and is usually in the hands of the CRO or sales operations team. The two lengths of time that we care about in finance are: top of funnel to sales qualification (i.e. marketing cycle length) and then sales qualification to closed-won (i.e. sales cycle length).</p><p>There is a large variance in sales cycle lengths from business to business. For example, consumer software might have a &lt;1 month sales cycle that runs entirely on marketing. On the other end of the spectrum, a complex sale to a large institution may take over a year and involve a number of different people and teams.</p><p>For the in-month sales cycle, New ARR in Month X will be attributed to the Marketing expense in Month X. Pretty straightforward.</p><p>As soon as you have a separate marketing funnel and sales funnel and things take longer than a few weeks, it becomes more complicated to measure, track and predict.</p><p>I often see operating stats that look like this:</p><figure id="w-node-be6f6b2d374d-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f755f630ab3e0e98ebd_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252F79d18d99-150c-4eae-b10a-cc00916f9da3_1168x196.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>The high level sales efficiency metric is New ARR / S&amp;M: the idea being that we are investing in S&amp;M in order to generate new ARR. The missing piece of information here is <strong>how long are the customers in the marketing funnel and how long are they in the sales funnel</strong>. Without that info, people often assume that it is in the same time period - whether that is a month, a quarter or a year. Switching over to a CAC calculation based on sales cycle length gives a more accurate picture of the sales efficiency.<br></p><p>For example: let’s say the marketing funnel takes <strong>1 month</strong> and the sales funnel takes <strong>3 months</strong>.<br></p><p>As a result, CAC would be the Marketing expense from 3 months prior and the average of the Sales expense over the last 3 months. So in the above example, new ARR acquired in April would be associated with the Marketing spend in January and the average of the Sales spend in Feb, March and April. Because this is a growing business, CAC will be lower than the S&amp;M in the same month, meaning that efficiency numbers are actually higher when based on CAC. Quick note to operating executives: don’t use a basic formula and sell yourself short.<br></p><p>Now looking at it through the lens of sales cycle-dependent CAC:<br></p><figure id="w-node-5b3f68252472-51d2da99"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e8a043bfbc2c035b4d8e5b5/5f4e9f8ca3a860067d1d36b8_https%253A%252F%252Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fce0d6249-9d70-4cff-87bb-36004dfe03c8_1168x278.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once you have the CAC line in the model, you can use it for SaaS Magic number, CAC payback, and a number of other metrics. (Of course, as the sales cycle changes, the CAC calculation must also change.) These metrics are important because they usually stay constant for a given product and business operation and allow you to project into the future.</p><p>The CAC calculation gets you one level deeper towards operating metrics from the high level financial metrics and is often a good bridge between the two. It represents the detailed funnels at a high level, and will ultimately drive projections with a higher degree of accuracy. For example, we now know that leads acquired through marketing spend in December will not yield sales until 3 months later in March. Based on historical metrics, we know roughly how many leads this spend will get us and therefore what kind of sales capacity we need to close on those leads and can plan sales hiring accordingly.<br></p><p>Coming from the financial perspective down into the operating perspective is a bit of a rabbit hole, so there’s an art in knowing where to stop, and it’s usually the point where precision starts to overtake accuracy in the model and digging deeper stops yielding better results. One step down from this, for example, would be to look into the sales expense - sales people are generally paid 50%+ of their total salary in commissions. If those commissions are paid in the month of sale, half of the sales expense should be weighted from that month and the other half weighted across the earlier months. If sales people are paid later on, then looking at it from a purely economic perspective as it pertains to commission rates will yield a much better result than looking at the accounting outputs for sales expense.<br></p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I came across a <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/if-else-is-a-poor-mans-polymorphism-ab0b333b7265">blog post</a>
whose author claims, from the perspective of good coding practices, polymorphism is strictly superior to branching. 
In the post they make general statements about how branching statements lead to unreadable, unmaintainable, inflexible code and
how they are a sign of immaturity. However, in my opinion, the topic is much deeper and in this post 
I try to objectively discuss the reasons for and against branching.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>Before I dive into polymorphism vs branching dilemma, let’s first define what we mean when we say some code is
flexible and easy to extend. In my career I reviewed thousands of lines of code, and I had thousands of lines of my code
reviewed by others, and during these reviews it often occured that the terms <em>code extensibility</em> or <em>flexibility</em> 
mean different things to different people. Familiarity with the code-base or particular programming style plays a huge role.</p>

<p>For example, someone used to writing code in a Java/C# OOP style would generally consider dynamic polymorphism through 
interfaces a standard way of providing extensibility to the code, 
while a C programmer may find a switch or if/else much more 
approachable than OOP. There are also many other factors related 
to maintainability as quality of documentation, good naming, separation of concerns, etc. These factors are orthogonal 
to the “polymorphism vs branching” dimension and also far too broad for a single blog post, so I won’t discuss them.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post, let’s define <em>extensibility</em> as the inverse of number of distinct units in the codebase
that need to be changed in order to implement a new feature. The more places you have to touch to implement the feature, 
the harder the code is to change. Obviously, it is much better when you have to touch only
one unit of code (one function, one class, one module, one package) rather than change 10 distinct unrelated units.</p>


<p>Imagine you’re writing a calculator. Your program gets an expression as an input and outputs the computed value.
For example the user inputs <code>1 + 2 * 3</code> and the output is <code>7</code> 
(or <code>9</code> if you’ve messed up the operator precedence like one of my former CS students).</p>

<p>Why such a silly example? Who is writing calculators these days? Probably no-one, but this looks like a classic example given
in many programming classes. And it is easy enough to illustrate the concept.</p>

<p>How can we model a structure to represent an expression?
You’d probably use classes or structures. Here is the code in Scala:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>value</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>+</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then it is quite easy to build an expression and evaluate it:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>),</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)).</span><span>eval</span> <span>// evaluates to 5 </span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>This OOP-based solution is indeed very extensible when it comes to add a new operator.
The example above is missing subtraction operation. We can add one by defining a new class:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Sub</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>left</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span> <span>-</span> <span>right</span><span>.</span><span>eval</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s really awesome – we didn’t have to touch any old code at all! 
OOP definitely rocks here.</p>


<p>Imagine you continued to extend our calculation engine with more operation classes over the next few years.
You’ve added multiplication, division, modulo, variables, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.</p>

<p>Then suddenly a new requirement comes – users want to not only evaluate the value of an expression,
but also do symbolic manipulation – e.g. simplify expressions. For example, given an expression
<code>a + a</code> they want to get an expression <code>2 * a</code> as a result.</p>

<p>This requirement can’t be captured by the <code>eval</code> method on the <code>Expression</code> interface. We need a new method:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And as the next step, they would likely want to be able to display the expression as a String:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How many units of code do you have to change now to implement these features?
<strong>All the implementations of <code>Expression</code></strong>. Before touching all the classes, the code wouldn’t even compile.
It looks like in the context of this kind of feature, our polymorphic solution is terribly non-extensible.</p>


<p>Let’s take a step back and let’s see how we could implement this differently.
Scala and many other modern languages have a feature called <em>pattern matching</em>
which can be considered a very flexible, powerful switch.</p>

<p>Instead of defining the operations like <code>eval</code> or <code>simplify</code> on the case classes,
let’s pull them up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>{</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>


<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now adding a new operation like <code>Sub</code> would require two changes to the code – adding a new class
<em>and</em> adding a new case in the match (switch) statement.</p>

<p>Some may say this much worse not only because of more places to update, but because of a possibility of
forgetting to update the switches which could lead to runtime errors due to unhandled cases.
Fortunately, Scala designers thought about this by providing the <code>sealed</code> keyword, which instructs the compiler
that all case classes can be defined in the same module only. This unlocks pattern exhaustiveness analysis and the
compiler would warn about missing cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sealed</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>
<span>case</span> <span>class</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Expression</span>

<span>def</span> <span>eval</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Double</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What about adding new functions like <code>simplify</code> or <code>toString</code>? 
It requires to changle only <strong>one place</strong> – by adding the required methods. 
No changes to the existing code are needed!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>simplify</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>),</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>other</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>other</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>def</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>:</span> <span>Expression</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>e</span> <span>match</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Const</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"("</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>" + "</span> <span>+</span> <span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>"</span><span>)</span> 
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>


<p>The blog post I mentioned in the introduction stated that using polymorphism instead of
branching leads to more readable code. I find this statement far too general and actually very debatable.</p>

<p>First, even in their own example given by the author of that blog, the solution using branching was a lot
shorter and less complex than the solution using OOP. While brief code is not always more readable than a longer version of it,
in that case, I found branching to be very explicit and easy to follow. 
It is much easier to understand the control flow
in such a program because all targets are explicitly given in a single place. In the OOP solution, 
the actual implementations are hidden behind the interface and it is much harder to find them all without additional 
help of a good IDE with a “jump to implementations” feature 
(which fortunately often works well for statically typed languages, but I’ve seen IDEs sometimes 
struggle with dynamic languages like Python).</p>

<p>Second, in general case, branching has an advantage that the function logic may depend on more than
one object type or even the actual data. For example, in the example from this post, 
the transformation <code>a * (b + c)</code> =&gt; <code>a * b + a * c</code> would depend on 
both addition and multiplication. In the classic OOP solution, would you place it in the <code>Add</code> or in the <code>Mul</code> class? 
Neither seems right. Also, putting it into one of them creates a dependency on the other one. 
An expression simplifier with code scattered accross multiple classes heavily depending on each other 
would be hard to understand.</p>


<p>This is a blog on high performance programming, so the post would be incomplete without a 
section on performance. In theory, a sufficiently good compiler should produce the same
code regardless of the choice between branching or dynamic polymorphism, but is this the case in reality?
Compilers have limitations and often don’t generate the best result code possible.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a more realistic example this time.
Some time ago I was working on serializing/deserializing code in a database system.
I stumbled upon a set of classes that described data types. They all implemented 
a common interface defining methods for serializing and deserializing values of given data type
and also computing serialized data lenghts. The following Rust snippet is a huge simplification 
of that code, but it illustrates the concept:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>BoolType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>IntType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>4</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>DataType</span> <span>for</span> <span>LongType</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span> <span>8</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>data_type</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>data_type</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Given a reference to a <code>DataType</code> object, it is trivial to compute the data size associated with it, 
without knowing the exact static type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>t1</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>t2</span> <span>=</span> <span>LongType</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>v</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>DataType</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>&amp;</span><span>t1</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>t2</span><span>];</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 4</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data_len</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]));</span>  <span>// prints 8</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="performance-of-dynamic-dispatch">Performance of Dynamic Dispatch</h2>

<p>The implementation of the <code>data_len</code> function is actually very simple:</p>


<p>Wow! A single assembly instruction! 
It jumps to the address stored in the the vtable of the object pointed by the <code>rsi</code> register.
The target of the jump depends on the actual type of the object. Here is the code generated for <code>IntType.len</code>:</p>



<p>The codes for the other types differ only in the constant value.</p>

<p>These are only 3 instructions to return the result. Shouldn’t it be fast? 
Let’s measure this. Let’s put more random <code>DataType</code> objects …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>At Buffer, we’ve been using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/buffer/">Kubernetes since 2016</a>.  We’ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kops</a>, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: <strong>CPU limits</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-limits-and-throttling">CPU limits and Throttling</h2>
<p>It is s general recommendation to set CPU limits. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits">Google, among others, highly recommends it</a>. The danger of not setting a CPU limit is that containers running in the node could exhaust all CPU available. This can trigger a cascade of unwanted events such as having key Kubernetes processes (such as <code>kubelet</code>) to become unresponsive. So it is in theory a great thing to set CPU limit in order to protect your nodes.</p>
<p>CPU limits is the maximum CPU time a container can uses at a given period (100ms by default). The CPU usage for a container will never go above that limit you specified. Kubernetes use a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS Quota</a> to <strong>throttle</strong> the container to prevent the CPU usage from going above the limit. That means CPU will be artificially restricted, making the performance of your containers lower (and slower when it comes to latency).</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-if-we-dont-set-cpu-limits">What can happen if we don’t set CPU limits?</h2>
<p>We unfortunately experienced the issue. The <code>kubelet</code> , a process running on every node, and in charge of managing the containers (pods)  in the nodes became unresponsive. The node will turn into a <code>NotReady</code> state, and containers (pods) that were present will be rescheduled somewhere else, and create the issue in the new nodes. Definitely not ideal isn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-throttling-and-latency-issue">Discovering the throttling and latency issue</h2>
<p>A key metric to check when you are running container is the <code>throttling</code> . This indicate the number of time your container has been throttled. Interestingly, we’ve discovered a lot of containers having throttling no matter if the CPU usage was near the limits or not. Here the example of one of our main API:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-usage-limits.png" alt="Kubernetes pods CPU usage and limits"></p>
<p>You can see in the animation that the CPU limits is set at <code>800m</code> (0.8 core, 80% of a core), and the peak usage is at most <code>200m</code> (20% of a core). After seeing, we might think we have plenty of CPU to let the service running before it throttle right? . Now check this one out:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/cpu-throttling-low-usage.gif" alt="Kubernetes pods Low CPU usage, High limit, lot of throttling"></p>
<p>You can notice the CPU throttling occurs, even though the CPU usage is below the CPU Limits. The maximum CPU usage isn’t even near the CPU limits.</p>
<p>We’ve then found a few resources(<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">github issue</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFApeaGv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1204">zanado talk</a>,  <a href="https://medium.com/omio-engineering/cpu-limits-and-aggressive-throttling-in-kubernetes-c5b20bd8a718">omio post</a>) talking about how throttling lead to poorer performances and latency for your services.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we see CPU throttling while CPU usage is low?</strong>
The tldr is basically a bug in the Linux kernel throttling unecessarly containers with CPU limit. If you’re curious about the nature of it, I invite you to check Dave Chiluk’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE7QX98-kO0">great talk</a>, a <a href="https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/12/unthrottled-fixing-cpu-limits-in-the-cloud/">written version</a> also exists with more details.</p>

<p>After many long discussions, we’ve decided to remove the CPU limits for all services that were directly or indirectly on the critical path of our users.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an easy decision since we value the stability of our cluster. We’ve experimented in the past some instability in our cluster with services using too much resources and disrupting all other services present in the same node.  That time was a bit different, we understood more about how our services needed to be and had a good strategy to roll this out.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-keep-your-nodes-safe-when-removing-limits-">How to keep your nodes safe when removing limits ?</h2>
<p><strong>Isolating “No CPU Limits” services:</strong></p>
<p>In the past we’ve seen some nodes going to a <code>notReady</code> state, mainly because some services were using too much resources in a node.</p>
<p>We’ve decided to put those services on some specific nodes (tainted nodes), so those services will not disrupt all the “bounded” ones.  We have better control and could identify easier if any issue occurs with a node. We did this by tainting some nodes and adding toleration to services that were “unbounded”. Check <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/">the documentation</a> on how you can do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/buffer-k8s-infrastructure-nodes.jpg" alt="Buffer k8s nodes infrastructure"></p>
<p><strong>Assigning the correct CPU and memory request:</strong></p>
<p>The main worry we had was service using too much resources and leading to nodes becoming unresponsive. Because we now had great observability of all services running in our cluster (with Datadog), I’ve analyzed a few months of usage of each service we wanted to “unbound”. I’ve assigned the maximum CPU usage as the CPU request with a &gt; 20% margin. This will make sure to have allocated space in a node. If k8s won’t try to schedule any other service in that node.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/choose-cpu-request-based-on-max.png" alt="Chose CPU request based on max"></p>
<p>You can see in the graph that the peak CPU usage was <code>242m</code> CPU core (0.242 CPU core). Simply take this number and make it a bit higher to become the CPU request. You can notice that since the service is user facing, the peak CPU usage matches peak traffic time.</p>
<p>Do the same with your memory usage and requests, and you will be all set!
To add more safety, you can use the horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have room for it. Set an alert if your cluster do not have any room, or use the node austoscaler to add it automatically.</p>
<p>The downsides are that we lose in “<a href="https://wiki.openvz.org/WP/Containers_density">container density</a>”, the number of containers that can run in a single node. We could also end up with a lot of “slack” during a low traffic time.
You could also hit some high CPU usage, but nodes autoscaling should help you with it.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I’m happy to publish really great results after few weeks of experimentation, we’ve already seen really great latency improvements across all the services we’ve modified:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/kubernetes-cpu-limits/speedup-no-cpu-limits2.png" alt="faster-kubernetes-containers"></p>
<p>The best result happened on our main landing page (<a href="https://buffer.com/">buffer.com</a>) where we speed the service up to <strong>22x</strong> faster!</p>

<h2 id="is-the-linux-kernel-bug-fixed">Is the Linux kernel bug fixed?</h2>
<p>The bug <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=763a9ec06c4">has been fixed and merged into the kernel</a> for Linux distribution running 4.19 or higher (kudo again to <a href="https://twitter.com/dchiluk">Dave Chiluk</a> for finding and fixing that).</p>
<p>However, as for <em>September 2nd 2020</em>, when reading <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577">the kubernetes issue</a>, we can see various Linux projects that keep referencing the issue, so I guess some Linux distribution still have the bug and working into integrating the fix.</p>
<p>If you are below a Linux distribution that has a kernel version below 4.19, I’d recommend you to upgrade to the latest Linux distribution for your nodes, but in any case, you should try removing the CPU limits and see if you have any throttling.  Here a non exhausting list of various managed Kubernetes services or Linux distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian: The latest version <a href="https://erickhun.com/posts/kubernetes-faster-services-no-cpu-limits/%5Bhttps://www.debian.org/releases/buster/">buster</a> has the fix,  it looks <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1167353/accepted-linux-latest-419-105deb10u5deb9u1-source-amd64-into-oldstable-oldstable/">quite recent (august 2020)</a>. Some previous version might have get patched</li>
<li>Ubuntu: The latest version <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/">Ubuntu Focal Fosa 20.04</a> has the fix.</li>
<li>EKS has the fix since <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/175">December 2019</a>. Upgrade your AMI if you have a version below than that</li>
<li>kops: Since <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/9283">June 2020</a>,  <code>kops 1.18+</code> will start using <code>Ubuntu 20.04</code> as the default host image. If you’re using a lower version of kops, you’ll have to probably to wait the fix. We are currently in this situation.</li>
<li>GKE (Goggle Cloud) : The kernel fix was merged in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/release-notes#cos-stable-77-12371-141-0">January 2020</a>. But it does looks like throttling are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24356903">still hapenning</a></li>
</ul>
<p>ps: Feel free to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> if you have more precise information, I’ll update the post accordingly</p>
<p><strong>If the fix solved the throttling issue?</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsure if totally solved the issue. I will give it a try once we hit a kernel version where the fix has been implemented and will update this post accordingly. If anyone have upgrade I’m keen to hear their results.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you run Docker containers under Linux (no matter Kubernetes/Mesos/Swarm) you might have your containers underperforming because of throttling</li>
<li>Upgrade to the latest version of your distribution hoping the bug is fixed</li>
<li>Removing CPU limit is a solution to solve this issue, but this is dangerous and should be made with extra-care (prefer upgrading your kernel first and monitor throttling first)</li>
<li>If you remove CPU limits, carefully monitor CPU and  memory usage in your nodes, and make sure your CPU requests are</li>
<li>A safe way to is to use the Horizontal pod autoscaler to create new pods if the resource usage is high, so kubernetes will schedule it in nodes that have space.</li>
</ul>
<p>👉<strong>Hacker news update: lot of insighful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comments</a>. I’ve updated the post to have better recommendations. You should prefer upgrading your kernel version over removing the CPU limits. Be really mindful, set the proper CPU requests, add the necessary monitoring when you do this</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post helps you get performance gains on the containers you are running. If so, don’t hesitate to share or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24351566">comment</a> with always some insighful comments</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Supervised learning is perhaps the most common form of machine learning task in use nowadays.</p>
<p>This form of learning makes use of a labeled training dataset to create a model that predicts a target of interest. If this line makes absolutely no sense to you, don't worry. After reading this article you will have a clear understanding of supervised learning and its two most popular applications: regression and classification.</p>
<h2 id="trainingmachineswithexamples">Training machines with examples</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a process in which you teach a machine to predict a particular result by feeding it examples 'with the right answers'.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what are you trying to predict. You might want to create a program that classifies pet photos as <em>dog photos</em> or <em>cat photos</em>, or a program that predicts the prices of houses in different districts in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>After deciding the variable you are trying to predict (your <strong>target</strong>), it's time to gather data examples from the real world and <em>label them</em>. In our first example, we would start gathering photos with dogs and photos with cats and tagging them with the right category. This photo of a puppy is a dog photo, that photo of a cat playing with a laser is a cat photo, and so on for every example.</p>
<p>Before the training stage, you will set aside a percentage of your training set to test the performance of your models. Afterwards, you will feed your labeled examples into an algorithm that will learn to generalize a relationship between the inputs (the photos) and the targets (dog/cat), producing a model you can use to classify fresh images it has never seen before. In this context, this is what <em>training</em> means: teaching a machine to perform actions learned from training data.</p>
<p>You can evaluate how well the model performs on your training set, the one you put aside before training. If the results are satisfying, you can deploy the model into production and use it to solve the original problem. The following diagram shows a high-level view of the supervised learning process.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SupervisedLearning.png" alt="SupervisedLearning"></p>
<p>This is an example of a classification task.</p>
<p><strong>Classification</strong> and <strong>regression</strong> are the most common applications of supervised learning. If you are interested in a career in machine learning you will likely spend most of your time creating these types of models, so let's take a look at them.</p>
<h2 id="classifyingtheworld">Classifying the world</h2>
<p>A classifier is a model that tells you the <strong>class</strong>(category) an instance of your data belongs to. In the previous example, our instances were photos of pets, and the classes were <em>cat photos</em> and <em>dog photos</em>.</p>
<p>The training set for classification tasks is usually a collection of instances (individual instances of the phenomenon you are trying to model) with a <em>label</em> that specifies the class they belong to.</p>
<p>Classifiers can be further classified ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ) into different subtypes depending on the number of target classes (binary or multiclass) and how many categories an instance can belong to at the same time (single-label and multi-label), let's take a look at those.</p>
<h4 id="binaryclassifiers">Binary classifiers</h4>
<p>A binary classifier is a model that classifies examples into two possible classes. Classifiers are capable of telling you if an email is either <strong>spam</strong> or <strong>not spam</strong>, if a photo of a face is <strong>happy</strong> or <strong>sad</strong> or if a substance is <strong>harmless</strong> or <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
<p>The most common setup for binary classification is to have a positive class (<em>class</em>) and a negative class (<em>not-class</em>). In this sense, you can re-define the previous examples as spam/not-spam, happy/not-happy and dangerous/not-dangerous.</p>
<p>Some types of binary classifiers don't just tell you a result, but they also provide you a probability that the instance you are classifying belongs to the predicted class.</p>
<p>Binary classifiers are some of the most studied and used models in machine learning, and many other models build on top of them (like some forms of multiclass classifiers).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/BinaryClassifier.png" alt="BinaryClassifier"></p>
<h4 id="multiclassclassifiers">Multiclass classifiers</h4>
<p>As you might imagine from the title, a multiclass classifier is a model that classifies instances into many categories. Like in the previous case you can get the results as the probability of belonging to a particular class.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there is a difference depending on the number of classes an instance can belong to at the same time.</p>
<p>If the classes are mutually exclusive (an object can only belong to one class at a time) you are building a <strong>single-label multiclass classifier</strong>. If an instance can belong to more than 1 class at the same time then you need a <strong>multi-label classifier</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on the particular scenario, your choice of algorithms and evaluation methods will differ.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MulticlassClassifier.png" alt="MulticlassClassifier"></p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/MultilabelClassifier.png" alt="MultilabelClassifier"></p>
<h2 id="regression">Regression</h2>
<p>The goal of a regression model is to predict a continuous value. The training set for a regression problem is usually a collection of instances with the associated numeric value you are trying to predict.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of regression problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the price of houses in Amsterdam given the size of the house (in square meters), the year the house was built, the average income of the area in which the house is located, the number of bedrooms and the color of the mailbox.</li>
<li>Predict a person's likelihood developing diabetes given the height, weight, number of cigarettes smoked per day, average caloric intake, average hours of physical activity per week and amount of carbs consumed per day.</li>
<li>Predict the stock price of a company one year from now based on the number of Disney films released last year, the color of underwear the CEO wears with more frequency and the title of his/her aunt's favorite song.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regression tasks are extremely common in machine learning. If you decide to pursue a career in data science or ML engineering, many of the models you'll build are likely aimed to solve regression problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/11/SimpleRegressor.png" alt="SimpleRegressor"></p>
<h2 id="thecoreassumptionofsupervisedlearning">The core assumption of supervised learning</h2>
<p>Ok, now you have an idea of what supervised learning is and how the process works. In brief, you collect a lot of data relevant to the problem you are trying to solve and label it with the <em>correct answers</em>, or the expected result your model is trying to predict. Then, all this training data is fed into an algorithm that will generate a model that maps the inputs into classes(classification) or values(regression).</p>
<p>For this process to work, the information contained in the training set needs to have enough <strong>predictive power</strong> for the algorithm to find a correlation between the two sets.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to predict the likelihood a given person has to develop diabetes, you might want data like the BMI, genetic predisposition and dietary habits. All 3 with powerful correlation with the variable you are trying to find (likelihood to develop a disease, in this case). Other data, like favorite film, shoe size, and favorite headphone brand has less predictive power for this particular target, so it makes little sense to add it to the training set.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data gathered doesn't provide enough information to build a model that performs well, in this scenario you need to reformulate the problem or find data with better quality.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is a huge topic with lots of important concepts. The goal of this article was to present a high-level view of the topic. Hopefully, by now you have a better understanding of supervised learning, and we will be prepared to dig deeper in more elaborate topics in future articles.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        <iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTjjDo57B8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/releases/v07082020.png" alt="Example of a status server error message">

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀

<![CDATA[Two musings on the design of compiler warnings]]>

September 2, 2020 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/09/02/wparentheses/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today I finally write down some musings on two peripheral aspects of
compiler diagnostic design that I think are very important for certain kinds of warnings.
My first musing relates to <em>fixits</em>, and my second to <em>suppression mechanisms</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-fixit">What is a fixit?</h2>

<p>Most C++ compilers these days don’t just tell you <em>that</em> a problem occurred
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt"><code>ed</code>’s famous <code>?</code> prompt</a>),
and <em>what</em> the problem is (“expected identifier,” for example).
They’ll try to tell you <em>how to fix</em> the problem.</p>

<p>Compare GCC 4.1’s error messages with GCC 4.6’s. (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/KM8P9E">Godbolt.</a>)
For this input:</p>



<p>GCC 4.1 complains merely that you have put <code>multiple types in one declaration</code>.
GCC 4.6 more helpfully complains that it <code>expected ';' after struct definition</code>,
and points to the exact position where it believes a semicolon should be inserted.</p>

<p>GCC 7 goes even further, and suggests a <em>fixit</em> — a machine-readable “spellcheck suggestion”
that some IDEs are able to apply with a single click.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>test.cc:1:12: error: expected ';' after struct definition
 struct S {}
            ^
            ;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In medical terms, the compiler has gone from simply detecting the <em>symptom</em>
(“this declaration seems to contain two types, which isn’t valid C++”)
to producing a <em>diagnosis</em> of the disease (“I bet you forgot a semicolon somewhere”);
and a compiler that supports fixits is actually <em>prescribing a treatment plan</em>.
Each of these steps is a quantum leap beyond the previous one in terms of both user-friendliness
and implementation complexity.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-suppression-mechanism">What is a suppression mechanism?</h2>

<p>Suppression mechanisms relate to compiler <em>warnings</em>, not compiler errors.
Consider the following snippet (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/fTnao9">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if (argc = 1)
    puts("hello");
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Every mainstream compiler warns on this suspicious-looking code (GCC and Clang with <code>-Wall</code>; MSVC with <code>-W4</code>).
Here’s GCC’s diagnostic:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value [-Wparentheses]
    4 |     if (argc = 1)
      |         ~~~~~^~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that GCC doesn’t even bother to explain really what its diagnosis is;
it emits a passive-aggressive warning message that does nothing more than suggest how to
shut itself up!</p>

<p>The diagnosis, of course, is that frequently people mean to write <code>if (argc == 1)</code>
but their finger slips and they write <code>if (argc = 1)</code> instead, which unfortunately
is also valid C++ code. Every mainstream compiler has evolved the same way to deal with this:
if you really mean <code>=</code>, then you write an extra pair of parentheses around the expression, like so:</p>



<p>The extra pair of parentheses is what I’m calling a “suppression mechanism.”
It’s just an arbitrary way of silencing a warning diagnostic — telling the compiler
“no, I really <em>meant</em> to write this legal but unusual construct.”</p>

<p>Another well-known suppression mechanism is writing <code>(void)</code> in front of unused results
to silence <code>-Wunused-value</code> and <code>-Wunused-result</code> warnings (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WdrhrE">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[[nodiscard]] int foo();
void test(int x) {
    (void)x;
    (void)foo();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And a trivial suppression mechanism is implied by the name of the <code>-Wparentheses</code> warning:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: '&amp;&amp;' within '||' [-Wlogical-op-parentheses]
    return (a &amp;&amp; b || c);
            ~~^~~~ ~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here the compiler just wants you to add a pair of parentheses to clarify the precedence for the reader.</p>

<h2 id="musing-a-single-fixit-must-preserve-actual-behavior-or-likely-intent-but-cant-do-both">Musing: A single fixit must preserve (actual) behavior or (likely) intent, but can’t do both</h2>

<p>It’s easy for the programmer to “fix” diagnostics like <code>-Wunused-result</code> and <code>-Wlogical-op-parentheses</code>,
because they’re just asking the programmer to clarify intent that is already pretty clear:
<em>Yes</em>, I mean to discard this result. <em>Yes</em>, I mean to evaluate <code>(a &amp;&amp; b) || c</code>.</p>

<p>The more interesting diagnostics are the ones where the compiler believes it has identified a mismatch
between the code’s actual <em>behavior</em> and the programmer’s <em>intent</em>. Our <code>if (argc = 1)</code> example
above was like that. A more realistic example might be something like</p>



<p>Here it is almost certain that the programmer intended to write</p>



<p>However, the literal behavior of the code as written is equivalent to</p>



<p>When the compiler suggests a fixit for this warning, it has to choose: Should we suggest the fix
that changes the behavior of the code to what you probably meant to type — the “spellcheck” option?
Or should we show how to silence the warning while preserving the existing code’s behavior — the
“Add To Dictionary” option, if you will? (Or, continuing our medical analogy, there’s the “treatment”
option and the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_resuscitate">DNR</a>” option.)</p>

<p>Showing just the “treatment” option puts the compiler in the awkward position of “recommending” that you change
the behavior of code that is, after all, perfectly legal C++ already; blindly applying the fixit to
working code might break that code. But showing just the “suppression” option might encourage a programmer to
blindly apply the fixit to <em>broken</em> code, thus leaving the bug in place but making it harder to detect
in the future.</p>

<p>For certain kinds of warnings, Clang shows <em>both</em> fixits. Two examples of this in Clang 10
are (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/aWf9s6">Godbolt</a>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: using the result of an assignment as a condition without parentheses [-Wparentheses]
    if (x = foo())
        ~~^~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the assignment to silence this warning
    if (x = foo())
          ^
        (        )
note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
     if (x = foo())
          ^
          ==
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: &amp; has lower precedence than !=; != will be evaluated first [-Wparentheses]
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^~~~~~~~~~~
note: place parentheses around the '!=' expression to silence this warning
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
                    (        )
note: place parentheses around the &amp; expression to evaluate it first
    return (foo() &amp; mask != 0);
                  ^
            (           )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that in both cases, Clang decides to print the “suppression” option first
and the “treatment” option second.
But sometimes Clang prints the “treatment” option first and the “suppression” option second:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: size argument in 'strncmp' call is a comparison [-Wmemsize-comparison]
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ~~~~^~~
note: did you mean to compare the result of 'strncmp' instead?
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
           ^                    ~
                            )
note: explicitly cast the argument to size_t to silence this warning
    return strncmp(a, b, len &lt; 0);
                         ^
                         (size_t)( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: logical not is only applied to the left hand side of this comparison [-Wlogical-not-parentheses]
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^  ~~
note: add parentheses after the '!' to evaluate the comparison first
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                      (     )
note: add parentheses around left hand side expression to silence this warning
    return x == y &amp;&amp; !x == z;
                     ^
                     ( )
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, there are many more cases where Clang emits <em>only</em> the “suppression” option
as a fixit, leaving the programmer to figure out the “treatment” on their own. (GCC 10.2
emits a fixit for only the last of these four examples; and it’s the “suppression” option.)</p>

<p>Even in the absence of any machine-readable fixits, the phrasing of the warning message
itself can induce the human reader to think in terms of suppression or in
terms of treatment. A warning message can be phrased as “Please confirm that you meant X”;
or “You did X; did you mean Y?”; or even as “Your attempt to do Y failed.”</p>

<h2 id="musing-suppression-mechanisms-are-about-edit-distance-and-about-signaling">Musing: Suppression mechanisms are about edit distance, and about signaling</h2>

<p>Compiler warnings of the kind we’re discussing here are basically of the form
“You wrote X, but I think you meant Y.” This happens only when X and Y are
in some sense <em>close together</em>. Sometimes the “closeness” is semantic, not syntactic
(as when the programmer means to invoke copy elision but writes <code>return std::move(x)</code> instead).
But for our purposes today, let’s just think about <em>syntactic</em> closeness. You meant
to write Y, but a minor typographical slip caused you to write X. In the examples above,
the slips are things like “omit one <code>=</code>,” or “omit a pair of parens” or
“put <code>&lt; 0</code> inside the parens instead of outside.”</p>

<p>Take X=”equality-compare <code>!a</code> to <code>b</code>” and Y=”negate the sense of <code>a == b</code>.”
There are some pieces of code that clearly intend to express X, such as <code>(!a)==(b)</code>.
There are some that clearly intend to express Y, such as <code>a != b</code>.
But you wrote <code>(!a==b)</code>, which falls into a gray area: it’s not clear which of
X and Y you really intended to express.</p>

<p>The job of the compiler-diagnostic-developer is to create some separation between
the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly X”
and the space of inputs that the compiler considers “clearly Y.”
Essentially, we create an error-correcting code by deliberately increasing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">edit distance</a>
between pairs of inequivalent C++ programs — deliberately increasing the number of keystrokes
the programmer would have to screw up in order to transform a working (and warning-free)
C++ program into an inequivalent broken (yet warning-free) C++ program.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases where Y is more commonly intended than X, it should be relatively <em>easier</em>
to write Y than X. In our example that’s true even at the core-language level: <code>a != b</code> is
already easier to write than <code>!a == b</code>. But when we increase the distance between X-space and Y-space,
we shrink X-space by more than we shrink Y-space. If you really intend to express <code>!a == b</code>, we’ll force you
to retreat all the way to <code>(!a) == b</code>. This is kind of analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)">signaling principle</a>
in economics or evolutionary biology: Basically, if you want the compiler to accept your intent,
your code must adopt some cumbersome and frankly maladaptive ornamentation in order to <em>prove</em>
its worthiness to the compiler.</p>

<p>According to the prevailing theory of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">sexual selection in the animal kingdom</a>,
when a peahen is deciding whether to accept
a particular peacock, she uses …</p></div></div>

ESP32 is a series of dual-core up to 240Mhz, low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth/BLE.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/ac7ba2d12ae49bb808d323edae91463b7f97656872f7d24c91dab86d4ba1653d.jpeg"></p><p>Pwnagotchi is a tamagochi like device powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either through passive sniffing or by performing deauthentication and association attacks). This material is collected on disk as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including full and half WPA handshakes as well as PMKIDs. Or put quickly, it's a tamagochi who eats WiFi handshakes to be happy.</p><p>Hash Monster runs in a smaller size and cheaper platform superior to the Pwnagotchi in several aspects. While Pwnagotchi is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero and requires assembling a DIY kit with various components such as an eInk screen and an external powerbank, the Hash Monster works on directly on the tiny M5Stack device. M5 Stack couples an ESP32 with a small LCD display, buttons and internal battery. It’s a modular, stackable, scalable, and portable device which is powered with an ESP-32 core, which makes it open source, low cost, full-function, and easy for developers to handle ESP32 IoT product development. You can program M5Stack through Arduino, C++, Blockly or MicroPython to name a few. The complete development kit for M5 Stack just under $45 provides a friendly price and full-featured resources which makes it a good starter kit for you to explore ESP32. While the M5 Stack includes a built-in battery 110mAh, it can be upgraded with a stackable 700 mAh lipo battery extension module.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/615059260bcadb5085e71de543154bec6c52222f5d1efda91cdcafdbe403cce2.png"></p><p>The similarity between Pwnagotchi and Hash Monster is that they capture both PSK handshakes from WPA / WPA2 networks and PSK hashes contained in beacon frames with PMKID. A great advantage of PMKID cracking is that everything you need is available over the air even if there are no stations connected and only a single packet capture is required. Later we can crack these hashes with standard tools such as aircrack or hashcat, and thus obtain the credentials. Of course, we should only do this in networks that we manage ourselves or that we have permission to audit.</p><p><strong>The process.</strong></p><p>Hardware requirements:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3jFAnl8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">M5Stack CORE Development Kit</a> with built-in 110mAh Battery ($45)</li></ul><p>Optionally:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bit.ly/3gYtI48" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Extended Battery M5Stack Core Development Kit Capacity 700mAh Stackable Module</a> (USD$12)</li><li><a href="https://www.banggood.com/M5Stack-Multi-function-Digital-Watch-with-700mAh-Battery-for-M5Stack-ESP32-Core-p-1551727.html?rmmds=search&amp;cur_warehouse=CN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Smart Watch Module with 700mAh Battery for M5Stack ESP32 Core</a> ($15)</li></ul><p>The software installation is pretty straight forward:</p><p>1.Setup Arduino IDE environment.</p><p><em>M5Stack Arduino IDE Setup in 5 minutes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2es-l4z2Zg</a></em></p><p>2.

We will do this with two known tools – Aircrack-ng and Hashcat, which relies respectively on CPU and GPU power. We will be running these tools from linux, even though they are both found in a Windows version as well. Remember to use recent versions to benefit from the PMKID attack in addition to the traditional cracking of handshakes.</p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/adb3724e47a02d9fe14b83454cae422f882a9c99ccc78f0f2db6ef6e7a7f6f9b.png"></p><p>Aircrack-ng can be used for very basic dictionary attacks running on your CPU. Before you run the attack you need a wordlist. I recommend using the infamous rockyou dictionary file:</p><p># download the 134MB rockyou dictionary file</p><pre><code><code>curl -L -o rockyou.txt https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt</code></code></pre><p>Note, that if the network password is not in the wordlist you will not crack the password.</p><p># -a2 specifies WPA2, -b is the BSSID, -w is the wordfile</p><pre><code><code>aircrack-ng -a2 -b AC:FC:E3:C9:AB:C0 -w rockyou.txt 3.cap</code></code></pre><p>If the password is cracked you will see a KEY FOUND! message in the terminal followed by the plain text version of the network password.</p><p>Cracking an WiFi password using brute force attack for a long WiFi password without GPUs or Cloud help, will be a nightmare but if the password is short or you know the key pattern it will be "easily" cracked.</p><p>Here you have a small guide for linux (Ubuntu) to crack the WiFi password using the files stored on the SD_Card of the Purple Hash Monster using your computer.</p><p>First we need to install <strong>hashcat</strong></p><pre><code><code>sudo apt-get update</code><br>
<code> sudo apt install hashcat</code></code></pre><p>EAPOL/PMKID stored on the SD-Card are <em>pcap</em> files, we have to convert to <em>hccapx</em> format to work with hashcat. In terminal from the directory were we have the <em>pcap</em> file from the SD-CARD:</p><pre><code><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils/master/src/cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c</code><br>
<code> ./cap2hccapx 1.pcap 1.hccapx</code></code></pre><p>For example if we know that the wifi password has a lenght of 8 digits we can run the following command, and in few seconds we will have the WiFi Password :)</p><pre><code><code>hashcat --force -m 2500 -a 3 -1 ?d -o cracked 1.hccapx ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1</code></code></pre><p><strong>Final notes</strong></p><p>Although in my case I exclusively use the M5 Stack for the pocket monster hash, there are undoubtedly several projects that run on the M5 Stack and you will certainly want to take a look if you are interested in wifi and bluetooth security attack tools for this platform.</p><p>M5 Stack WiFi SSID Scanner by Elkentaro</p><p><a href="https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/elkentaro/M5_SSID_scanner_collector</a></p><p>Covid Sniffer: BLE COVID exposure app sniffer using M5 Stack</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/mschmidl/covidsniffer</a></p><p><img src="https://telescopecdn.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/37366466393830322d656263312d343530392d396463372d653761313033646136666237/02ee78aa44062073eb950642e19a44a548daf55d3217643f1a98cc84d37bc7d6.jpeg"></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><code>API</code> is the acronym for Application Programming Interface which defines interactions between multiple software architecture layers. Programmers carry out complex tasks easily using APIs in software development. Without APIs, a programmer's life would have been miserable with no proper(security, for example) access to data,  knowing unnecessary low level details etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to Web APIs, there are extremely useful  objects, properties and functions available to perform tasks as minor as accessing DOM to as complex as managing audios, videos, graphics, etc. </p>

<p>If you are from the web development background, you are using many of them already. Here is the list of very well known web APIs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API">Geolocation</a> </li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API">Drag &amp; Drop API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I am going to talk about 10 more web APIs that are not so popular. Lesser popular doesn't mean, they are not useful. You can use them in various use-cases of your project. Please have a look.</p>

<p>If you would like to jump into the source code or see the demonstration immediately, here are the quick links to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/atapas/demolab/tree/master/code/src/demos/web-apis">Link to the Source Code @GitHub</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://demo.greenroots.info/categories/web-apis/">Link to the Web API DemoLab</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Web APIs are nothing but the interfaces, functions, objects, properties written and exposed using vanilla JavaScript. However the usage of the web APIs is not limited to the vanilla JavaScript based application alone. It is very straightforward to use them with an Angular, React or Vue based applications as well.</p>
<p>All the examples I have used to demonstrate the web apis in this article are written using reactjs. You can find them in the github link mentioned above. Please feel free to fork, change and use!</p>

<p>A big (pain) point about  using a web API is, most of them are not standardized yet. It means, the support for a web API  may differ from one browser vendor to another. For example, You may find an API working with the Chrome browser but, not supported by Firefox or Edge browsers yet.</p>
<p>I would suggest a couple of ways to have a check on this,</p>


<p>Alright, time to get started knowing them. Hope you also find these useful.</p>
<h2 id="1-fullscreen-api">1. 📺 Fullscreen API</h2>
<p>Do you have the need to show any of the DOM elements in full-screen mode? The full-screen use-case is very demanding for gaming applications, online video platforms(like, youtube) etc. </p>
<p>The <code>Fullscreen API</code> provides methods to present a specific Element (and its children) in a full-screen mode. There is a method available to exit full-screen mode once it is no longer needed. Not only that, this API can also help to perform any actions when a DOM element transition into a full-screen mode or comes out of it.</p>
<p>In the example below, my favorite Santa Claus can get into the full-screen mode and come out of it with ease.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598715764074/fR7trCfsA.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="full_screen.gif"></p>
<p>In the code below, the <code>manageFullScreen()</code> function uses  the <code>requestFullscreen()</code> API on an element which is having an id called, <code>fs_id</code>. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> manageFullscreen = () =&gt; {
   <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'fs_id'</span>).requestFullscreen();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This element with id, <code>fs_id</code> is a <code>DIV</code> with a child element, i.e, the Santa Clause image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div className=<span>"column"</span>&gt;
  <span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"fs_id"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>Img</span> <span>fixed</span>=<span>{imageData.image.childImageSharp.fixed}</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"santa"</span> /&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;<span>StyledButton</span> 
         <span>onClick</span>=<span>{manageFullscreen}</span>&gt;</span>
            Enter Fullscreen with Santa
    <span>&lt;/<span>StyledButton</span>&gt;</span>

<h2 id="2-clipboard-async-api">2. 📋 Clipboard Async API</h2>
<p>What is a clipboard in comuping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The clipboard is a buffer that some operating systems provide for short-term storage and transfer within and between application programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are mainly three operations you can perform with the clipboard. They are, <code>copy</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>paste</code>. The Clipboard API provides the ability to respond to these three operations. </p>
<p>Interestingly, copying content to the clipboard is open as in, there is no need of a user permission. However, for pasting the content from the clipboard to the user application, the user needs to grant permission for it. It is achieved using another web API called, <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API">Permission API</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598716493747/PwPwDDK8Y.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of the copy-paste operation,</p>

<p>This is how to check if the feature is supported by the browser,</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (navigator.clipboard 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.read 
     &amp;&amp; navigator.clipboard.write) {
   setSupported(<span>true</span>);
} <span>else</span> {
   setSupported(<span>false</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the async API function for writing the content to the clipboard,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performCopy</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
      <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText);
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>`<span>${copyText}</span> copied to clipboard`</span>);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to copy: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Async API function to read the content from the clipboard and do something with it,</p>
<pre><code><span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>performPaste</span>(<span>event</span>) </span>{
   event.preventDefault();
   <span>try</span> {
       <span>const</span> text = <span>await</span> navigator.clipboard.readText();
       setPastetext(text);
       <span>console</span>.log(<span>'Pasted content: '</span>, text);
   } <span>catch</span> (err) {
      <span>console</span>.error(<span>'Failed to read clipboard contents: '</span>, err);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: With the inclusion of the <code>Clipboard Async API</code>, you can get rid of the usage of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">document.execCommad()</a> function as it is obsolete now.</p>

<h2 id="3-resize-observer-api">3. 🧐 Resize Observer API</h2>
<p>Do you want to take some actions based on the changes to the content or border box of a DOM element? Are you thinking of writing a handler by yourself? What if I tell you, there is already one provided by the web API implementation?</p>
<p>Here is a story about a dumb button. We use a range slider to resize the button. While the button gets resized, we also want to control the text color, without letting the button know much about it. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717277220/dITL6Nog2.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="resizer.gif"></p>
<p>First, create a button and specify an id so that, we can access the button later using the id.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;StyledButton id=<span>"dumbBtnId"</span>&gt;
   I am a Dumb Button
&lt;<span>/StyledButton&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we create a slider using the <code>range</code> input type from HTML5. A <code>resize()</code> function is invoked when the slider value changes.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
   <span><span>&lt;<span>input</span> 
         <span>onChange</span>=<span>{(event)</span> =&gt;</span> resize(event)} 
         type="range" 
         min={minRange} 
         max={maxRange} 
         defaultValue={rangeValue} /&gt;
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>resize()</code> function simply sets the width of the button as the slider range value so that, it can be resized dynamically.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> resize = event =&gt; {
   <span>const</span> value = event.target.valueAsNumber;
   setRangeValue(value);
   <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
   dumbBtn.style.width = <span>`<span>${value}</span>px`</span>;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good? Now for every range value change, the button gets resized. We have a <code>ResizeObserver</code> observing this change and change the color of the button text.</p>
<pre><code>useEffect(() =&gt; {
   <span>try</span> {
            <span>let</span> dumbBtn = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'dumbBtnId'</span>);
            <span>var</span> resizeObserver = <span>new</span> ResizeObserver(entries =&gt; {
                <span>for</span>(<span>const</span> entry <span>of</span> entries) {
                    
                    
                   entry.target.style.color = <span>'green`;
                }
      });
      resizeObserver.observe(dumbBtn);
   } catch(e) {
            setSupported(false);
            console.log(e);      
   }
}, [rangeValue]);</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="4-image-capture-api">4. 📷 Image Capture API</h2>
<p>There are some cool and useful APIs around user media like, audio, video etc. I love the <code>Image Capture API</code> which helps us to capture an image or grab a frame from the video devices(like webcam). Not only that, you can also perform actions on capturing an image or grabbing a frame.</p>
<p>First, get the user media access. In this case we are getting the webcam access.</p>
<pre><code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: <span>true</span>})
  .then(mediaStream =&gt; {
     <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'video'</span>).srcObject = mediaStream;
     <span>const</span> track = mediaStream.getVideoTracks()[<span>0</span>];
     setTrack(track);
  }).catch(error =&gt; {
     <span>console</span>.error(<span>` <span>${error}</span> is not yet supported`</span>);
     setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Just like the clipboard paste operation, a webcam media access permission has to be granted by the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717565379/MCRNY49Tl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Now Grab a frame and do something. In this example, I am just drawing the frame on a Canvas.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.grabFrame()
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#grabFrameCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I can also take a picture and do the similar thing.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> imageCapture = <span>new</span> ImageCapture(track);
    imageCapture.takePhoto().then(blob =&gt; createImageBitmap(blob))
      .then(imageBitmap =&gt; {
          <span>const</span> canvas = <span>document</span>.querySelector(<span>'#takePhotoCanvas'</span>);
          drawCanvas(canvas, imageBitmap);
    }).catch(error =&gt; {
          <span>console</span>.log(error);
          setError(error);
});
</code></pre>
<p>To stop the video streaming from the webcam, just call he method <code>stop()</code> on the running video track.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> videoOff = () =&gt; {
   track.stop();
 }
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598717833234/MPOxVZ92M.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="chrome_Umvi16wUlu.png"></p>
<p>Also watch out for the methods,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>getPhotoCapabilities()</code>: To get the ranges of available configuration options.</li>
<li><code>getPhotoSettings()</code>: To get the current photo configuration settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>Broadcast Channel API</code> allows communication between browsing contexts (windows, tabs, iframes) and workers on the <strong>same origin</strong>. Think of a use-case like, once you logout from an app running in a browser tab, you want to broadcast it to the app instances opened in other tabs of the same browser.</p>

        <p>With this year’s <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020">International Conference on Machine Learning&nbsp;(ICML)</a>
being over, it is time to have another instalment of this series.
Similar to <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/icml_tda_roundup/">last year’s post</a>, I shall cover
several papers that caught my attention because of their use of
topological concepts—however, <em>unlike</em> last year, I shall not
restrict the selection to papers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis">topological data analysis&nbsp;(TDA)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector:</strong> I might have missed some promising papers. Any
suggestions for additions are more than welcome! Please reach out

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04881">Learning Flat Latent Manifolds with VAEs</a>
by <a href="https://argmax.ai/team/nutan-chen">Nutan Chen</a>, <a href="https://www.argmax.ai/team/alexej-klushyn">Alexej Klushyn</a>,
Francesco Ferroni, <a href="http://bayerj.github.io/">Justin Bayer</a>, and
<a href="https://argmax.ai/team/patrick-van-der-smagt">Patrick van der Smagt</a>
discusses an interesting modification of variational autoencoders, viz.
an extended loss term that regularises the latent space to be
<em>flat</em>&nbsp;(i.e. having no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature">curvature</a>).
The main idea is to ensure that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor">Riemannian metric tensor</a>
is the identity matrix.</p>
<p>The ingenious implication of such a latent space is that the Euclidean
distance is a good proxy for the similarity between data points, whereas
this is <em>not</em> a priori the case for other latent spaces. It is interesting
to note that there is a ‘sibling’ paper to this one, which was published
at ICLR 2020, namely <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1g6xeSKDS">Mixed-curvature Variational Autoencoders</a>.
This paper presents an autoencoder whose latent space is a product of
Riemannian manifolds, whose curvature is either fixed or learnable.</p>
<p>I am glad to see that curvature is starting to attract more attention
from the machine learning community. It is such a fundamental property
of a manifold but can influence the validity of many calculations in
latent spaces. It also has some beneficial properties for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BylEqnVFDB">graph
classification</a>, but this is
maybe a better topic for a subsequent post!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10996">Graph Filtration Learning</a> by
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> is arguably<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> the first step
towards properly integrating topological features into neural networks
for graph classification! Briefly put, we developed a homological
<code>READOUT</code> function&nbsp;(to use the parlance of graph neural networks)
that gives rise to a learnable filter function—a <em>filtration</em>.</p>
<p>This concept might be unknown to some readers, but a filtration in this
context is a scalar-valued function on the vertices of a graph that
permits <em>sorting</em> it. Filtrations serve as the backbone for many
topology-based algorithms, primarily for the aforementioned <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>,
which permits us to study multi-scale topological
features&nbsp;(connected components, cycles, etc.) of an object.
Prior to this paper, filtrations were pre-defined or chosen based on
some target function, such as the vertex degree function of a graph. Our
approach changes this—leading to a filtration that is learnable in an
end-to-end fashion and thus specifically designed for a classification
problem.</p>
<p>We manage to achieve this by first initialising our filter function
based on a regular graph neural network; essentially, one level of
message passing between nodes is sufficient. This provides us with
a non-trivial filter function whose performance we can subsequently
adjust by calculating the topological features induced by said filter,
and vectorising the resulting representations. Since each of these steps
is differentiable<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the resulting function is also differentiable,
making it possible to adjust the filter for the best classification
results.</p>
<p>I would recommend this paper to anyone who is interested in learning
more about the benefits that a topology-based perspective brings to
certain application problems. Being able to learn the <em>right</em> topological features
to classify a set of graphs opens up exciting opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04805">Topologically Densified Distributions</a>
by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christoph_Hofer8">Christoph Hofer</a>,
<a href="https://www.uni-salzburg.at/index.php?id=213185&amp;L=1">Florian Graf</a>,
<a href="http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~mn/?q=content/overview">Marc Niethammer</a>, and
<a href="https://rkwitt.github.io/">Roland Kwitt</a> studies regularisation properties of
over-parametrised neural networks in the context of small sample-size learning.
This is achieved by studying the properties of latent
representations&nbsp;(the paper uses the term <em>internal representation</em>,
but this is equivalent). More precisely, generalisation properties are
analysed via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure">push-forward probability measure</a>
induced by the latent representation&nbsp;(or <em>encoding</em>).</p>
<p>The authors show that probability mass concentration around training
samples in the latent space is linked to the generalisation capabilities
of a model, but, even more exciting, such a concentration can be achieved by applying
topological constraints on samples from that space! In the context of
this paper, such constraints pertain to measuring the <em>connectivity</em> of
samples. This is achieved using <a href="https://christian.bock.ml/posts/persistent_homology/">persistent homology</a>, specifically,
by calculating a zero-dimensional Vietoris–Rips complex—if you are
not familiar with this term, just think of a minimum spanning tree.</p>
<p>What I particularly enjoyed about this paper is that it starts providing
solid answers to fundamental concepts in machine learning. All too often,
we remain in the realm of the empirical and just <em>observe</em> whether our
network generalises. This paper ventures into hitherto-unknown territories
and gives us a theoretical justification!</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00722">Topological Autoencoders</a> by
<a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/">Michael Moor</a>,
<a href="https://expectationmax.github.io/">Max Horn</a>,
<a href="https://bastian.rieck.me/">Bastian Rieck</a>, and
<a href="https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten.html">Karsten Borgwardt</a> deals with
regularising the latent space in terms of its topology. More precisely,
we preserve the topological features of the input data in the respective
latent space&nbsp;(on the batch level, respectively). While we restrict
our experiments to connected components for now&nbsp;(so no cycles
yet, even though our method generalises to higher dimensions),
our approach makes it possible to create latent representations
that ‘mimic’ the topological features of the input.</p>
<p>This leads to a nice plug-and-play loss term that can be easily
integrated into most architectures, and we can demonstrate that, among
others, it considerably improves the quality of a ‘vanilla’ autoencoder
architecture. To achieve this goal, we had to solve all kinds of
interesting adventures, one of them being how to make everything
differentiable. Interestingly, we end up with a similar necessary
condition for differentiability than for the graph filtration learning
paper, viz. the pairwise distances between different samples of the
input batch need to be <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>The coolest feature of our method is that it technically <em>only</em> requires
a distance metric between input samples<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, nothing more—no feature
vector representation or anything. It can thus conceivably be used to
represent the topology of any object you fancy&nbsp;(including
documents, images, and graphs).</p>

to this publication, you should take the time to read Michael’s <a href="https://michaelmoor.ml/blog/topoae/main/">blog post on our paper</a>.</p>

<a href="https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/shanahan_phiala.html">Phiala E.  Shanahan</a>,
and <a href="http://theoryandpractice.org/">Kyle Cranmer</a>
present a novel method for calculating normalising flows on more complex
spaces than the usual Euclidean ones. Specifically, as the title
implies, they develop methods for calculating such flows on tori and
spheres.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed about this paper is the smart way of constructing flows
iteratively: first, flows on the circle are being constructed&nbsp;(using
different concepts for defining a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism">diffeomorphism</a>, the most favourite of
mine being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Möbius transformation</a>).
Since a torus can be described as the Cartesian product of circles, this
is sufficient to describe flows on tori of arbitrary dimensions! Next,
the flows are generalised to higher-dimensional spheres.</p>
<p>While I am by no means and expert in normalising flows, I liked
reading this paper a lot. The theory is well-developed and it is another
one of those publications that shows you how to go beyond the boundaries
of what is currently possible. Moreover, I enjoyed the discussion of the
implementation details—it turns out that achieving numerical stability
here is another feat that deserves some mention!</p>

<p>This year’s ICML also featured an interesting array of topology-based
papers. Not all of them fit neatly into the field of topological data
analysis&nbsp;(TDA), but I am happy to see that the community is
starting to pick up this fundamental topic. I remain convinced that
a topology-driven perspective is needed to answer certain foundational
questions in machine learning. Here’s to the future of topology!</p>

September 1, 2020 | https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><img src="https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/c/fight.jpeg" alt="Fish"></p>
<p>In the early 70s, C was created at Bell Labs as a byproduct of the development of UNIX.
It quickly became one of the most popular programming languages.
But it was not expressive enough for Bjarne Stroustrup.
And so, in 1983, as a byproduct of his Ph.D. thesis, he extended C.</p>
<p>C with classes was born.</p>
<p>At the time, Bjarne Stroustrup understood that a programming language has many components,
not only the language, its compiler, but also a linker and libraries.
Offering a familiar tool also makes adoption easier.
In this historical context, it makes sense that C++ would be based on C.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 40 years later.</p>
<p>Both C and C++ are widely used in the industry.
But go 5 minutes on the Internet and C developers will tell you that C++ is the most horrific man-made creation,
while many C++ developers wait for the day when C finally burns in the hot flames of hell.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>On the surface, C and C++ cater to the same use cases: high performance, deterministic, native but portable code for the widest range of hardware and applications.</p>
<p>But C is proudly a low-level language. A nicer assembly.</p>
<p>From day one, C++ had magic. Dark witchcraft: destructors. Suddenly the compiler was doing things on its own.
It also had type inference very early on, but the developers of the mid-80s were not quite ready for that and Bjarne Stroustrup
was pressured into removing <code>auto</code>, until it was added back to C++11.</p>
<p>From then, C++ got more and more tools to build abstractions.
I don’t think it would be fair to say that C++ is a low-level or high-level language. It’s both, by design.
But building high-level abstractions while not sacrificing performance is hard.
C++ then needed tools to achieve that: <code>constexpr</code>, move semantics, templates, and an ever-growing standard library.</p>
<p>Fundamentally I think C trusts developers while C++ trusts compilers.
This is a massive difference that sharing the same native types or syntax for while loop cannot hide.</p>
<p>C++ developers blame C for all their lost limbs, while C developers probably think C++ is batshit crazy.
I imagine that is a fair perspective if you look at C++ through a C lense. C++ is pretty wild <em>as a superset of C</em>.
A seasoned C person looking at C++ expecting familiarity in C++ will not find it. C++ is not C.
This is enough to feed flamewars for generations.</p>
<p>But as much as I dislike C, I don’t have any legitimacy to make fun of it. See, I have some experience with C++ but I
wrote very little C. It was probably bad C.
A language is also its good practices, patterns, idioms, and these take years to learn. If you try to write C code like it’s C++ or C++ like it is C, you will have a bad time.
Knowing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnWhqhNdYyk">C doesn’t teach you C++</a>. Knowing C++ does not teach you C.</p>
<p>So can we all stop saying C/C++, regret the unfortunate naming, and sing kumbaya in harmony?
Not so fast.</p>
<p>See, despite being philosophically different from C, C++ is still somewhat a superset of C.
That is to say, you can include a C header in a C++ translation unit and that should compile.
And this is where it gets messy.</p>
<p>C++ is not an extension of C.
It is designed as a separate standard, by a different committee, different people.
Logically, people who like C++'s philosophy will get involved in the C++ community and the C++ standardization process
while other people might try to get involved with C.
Committees, whether its C’s or C++'s, only manifest intent and direction through their respective end-product: the standards; standards which are the fruits of numerous voting.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is difficult for a compiler to know that it is dealing with a C header or a C++ header.</p>
<p><code>extern "C"</code> is not used consistently and only affects mangling, but neither grammar nor semantics.
And headers only exists in the eyes of the preprocessor, for a C++ compiler, everything is a C++ translation unit, and therefore C++.
And yet, people include C headers in C++ and expect it to “just work” ™️.
Which it mostly does.</p>
<p>We can wonder then,</p>
<h2 id="how-c-maintains-c-compatibility-while-being-developed-by-different-people-in-different-places">How C++ maintains C compatibility while being developed by different people in different places?</h2>
<p>Badly, I’m afraid.</p>
<p>A coworker recently reminded me of Conway’s law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that logic, it would stand to reason that if the two committees don’t interoperate,
neither would the languages they produce.</p>
<p>C++ maintains a list of <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.iso">incompatibilities with C</a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/diff.library">its standard library</a>.
This list does not seem to reflect the many features that were added to C11 and C18 but are not valid C++ constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_of_C_and_C%2B%2B">Wikipedia</a> draws a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Listing incompatibilities isn’t sufficient to get a measure of incompatibilities between both languages.</p>
<p>Functions that exist in the C++ standard library but whose primary declaration is expected to come from C are difficult to make <code>constexpr</code>, and more difficult still to make <code>noexcept</code>.
C compatibility translates to performance costs and C functions are optimization barriers.</p>
<p>Many C constructs are valid C++ but should never pass a code review (<code>NULL</code>, <code>longjmp</code>, <code>malloc</code>, create/destroy functions, <code>free</code>, C  casts), etc.</p>
<p>These might not be bad C idioms, but they are bad C++. C++ has a stronger type system,
and unfortunately using C idioms punch a giant hole in that type system, and so C compatibility has a cost in terms of safety.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, C++ still care about C compatibility. Somewhat.
And interestingly C cares about C++. Somewhat.
Truth be told, C might care about C++ more than C++ cares about C.
So each committee cares somewhat about what the other does.
We care reluctantly.</p>
<p>See, C++ is aware of the many foundational libraries written in C, not only the <code>libc</code> but also <code>zip</code>, <code>png</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>openssl</code> (!), and countless others, which are used in many, many C++ projects.
We can’t break that.</p>
<p>But recently, especially over the past decade, C++ has become much bigger than C.
C++ has more users - and a much more active community: <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/11/21/">There Are No C Conferences</a>.
Maybe that’s why the C++ committee is now over 10 times the size of the C committee.</p>
<p>C++ then is a force to be reckoned with and the C committee has to consider not breaking C++.
To the point that if a standard would track another, these days, C++ leads and C follow.</p>
<p>C++ is now on a steady three years cycle come rain or shine, or deadly pandemics.
Meanwhile, C has a major release every decade or so.
This makes sense. As a lower-level language, C doesn’t need to evolve as fast.</p>
<p>The C landscape is also rather different from the C++ landscape.
C caters to more platforms and a lot more compilers.
Everybody and their dog is writing C compilers because the language has a surface area small enough to make that possible, whereas the C++ committee will only really consider 4 implementations, all of which are represented at every meeting.
As a result, many features in C are implementation-defined or optionally supported so that the variety of compilers that exist can claim conformance without doing much work, which I’m told pleases regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>C++ these days is more interested in portability than implementation freedom. Yet another difference of philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="so-your-proposal-breaks-c-compatibility">So, your proposal breaks C compatibility</h2>
<p>Parts of my <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2178r1.pdf">P2178</a> paper theoretically affects C compatibility.
In such cases, none of the options seems satisfactory.</p>
<p>You could be told that you have to first get your feature into C. Which means more meetings.
Meetings you might not be able to attend because C has strict <a href="https://thephd.github.io/follow-the-river-wg14-ithaca-2019">attendance rules</a> - Excluding individuals not willing to put down thousands of dollars to become ISO members.
This is because the C committee is forced to adhere strictly to ISO rules.</p>
<p>It might also take a decade if the standard just shipped.
And most importantly, it might go nowhere if the C committee doesn’t understand or doesn’t care about the particular problem you are trying to solve.
And they probably don’t have the bandwidth to deal with it.
And you may not have the bandwidth to deal with C. After all, you joined C++ to improve C++.
In fact, if the room invites you to “talk to the C committee”, it is likely your proposal is dead, even in the unlikely event that no one in the room was against it.</p>
<p>Another likely scenario is that the C committee accepts a version of a proposal that is slightly different from what exists in C++.
<code>true</code>? Let’s make that a macro. <code>char16_t</code> ? Let’s make that a typedef. <code>char32_t</code>? Not necessarily UTF-32. <code>static_assert</code> ? <code>_Static_assert</code>.</p>
<p>The list goes on. Should we blame C? Probably not. Their committee does what they think is best for their language.
The opposite is true too. In C++20 designated initializers were inspired by C’s but are slightly different because they would otherwise not fit with the C++ initialization rules.</p>
<p>I am part of the problem. C has VLAs. I would vote against a proposal to adopt that in standard C++, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-Kills-The-VLA">too many security issues</a>. A proposal to add <code>_Generic</code> to C++ would be over-my-dead-body. I am not sure if <code>_Generic</code> attempts to palliate to the lack of template or the lack of overloads, but C++ has both these features - from my point of view <code>_Generic</code> doesn’t fit into the big picture of what I imagine C++ to be.</p>
<p>Both committees seem also inconsistent in how much they care about the other language.
Sometimes we go to great lenghts (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/complex">std::complex</a>), sometimes we don’t care at all (<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/array">static array parameters</a>).</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Don’t forget that each committee is a bunch of people
voting at different times in different rooms and trying to control the outcome would defeat the purpose
of having a vote.
Putting people in the same room is not realistic either. ISO might object and the participation inbalance
would put C people at an enormous disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="c-compatibility-doesnt-matter-kinda">C compatibility doesn’t matter, kinda</h2>
<p>If you are a C developer, I imagine you see C as a neat programming language.
But for the rest of us, C is something else.</p>
<p>C is the universal, cross-language glue that ties it all together.</p>
<p>For C++ users, C is …</p></div></div>

<p>This is an exploratory post of what extensible unions (a.k.a. polymorphic variants) might look like in Elm. This mainly a post to plant a seed in the minds of the collective Elm community and is not a call to action that they need to be implemented in Elm (although I would really really really love if they were).</p>
<p>One-line headline: I think extensible unions not only fill in a missing abstract corner of Elm’s type system (rather than being a entirely novel extension to its type system), but also solve many real-world problems affecting Elm codebases today, all without compromising and indeed augmenting the Elm compiler’s excellent way of guiding users through refactors.</p>
<p>This post is jumping off a separate post <a href="https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/how-to-represent-many-subsets-of-an-enum/6088/22">here</a> with some folks who were interested in a deeper explanation of extensible unions/polymorphic variants.</p>
<p>This post ended up being <strong>really</strong> long, so I apologize for its length in advance, but I do hope that people find it useful.</p>
<p>Because of its length I’ll just lead off with a high-level summary.</p>
<p>Polymorphic variants or extensible union types are to normal Elm union types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyUnionType = UnionVariant0 | UnionVariant1 | UnionVariant2</code>) what records and extensible records are to normal Elm product types (e.g.&nbsp;<code>type MyProductType = ProductType TypeOfElement0 TypeOfElement1 TypeOfElement2</code>).</p>
<p>As such they allow for many of the same benefits that records and extensible records bring to input types of functions and modularizing Elm models, to output types of functions and modularizing Elm messages and update functions.</p>
<p>This post is split up into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#what-are-extensible-union-types">What are extensible union types</a>: A introduction to some pseudo-Elm to help familiarize people with what extensible unions are. If you already know what extensible unions/polymorphic variants are you can skip this. <strong>The crucial take away is that we already have the equivalent of extensible unions for products, i.e.&nbsp;extensible records. This is just filling in a hole for current union types.</strong></li>
<li><a href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-extensible-unions">What are the benefits of extensible unions (the basics)</a>: Walking through some basic, contrived cases where extensible unions can come in handy.</li>
<li><a href="#everyday-elm-cases">Everyday Elm cases</a>: A non-exhaustive list of case studies of where extensible unions can help in code you’re likely to see in real Elm codebases.
<ul>
<li>Reminding you when you forget certain output cases for decoding</li>
<li>Unifying different error types</li>
<li>Modular Elm code: Unifying NoMap, OutMsg, and Translator</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks and things-you-might-think-are-drawbacks-but-aren’t (a.k.a. literature review of other implementations)</a>: A dive into some cons and not-really-cons of extensible unions as well as how they’re implemented in other languages (mainly OCaml).</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s begin with a very short primer on union (a.k.a. sum types) and product types. We’ll approach them individually even though in Elm we can mix and match them together in a single type declaration. This hopefully will make some of the later presentation of extensible union types a little easier to follow.</p>
<p>Union types are those types that express an “or” relationship among its type constructors.</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>-- MyColor is Red *or* Green *or* Blue</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyColor</span> <span>=</span> <span>Red</span> <span>|</span> <span>Green</span> <span>|</span> <span>Blue</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Product types are those types that express an “and” relationship in its (single) type constructor.</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- MyUserType is a MyUser that consists of a String *and* another String (maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- a first and last name)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a><span>type</span> <span>MyUserType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These two kinds of types are dual, i.e.&nbsp;complements, to one another, where you’ll see each of them playing “opposite” roles in a lot of circumstances. We’ve already seen one example here, whereas a union type can have multiple type constructors, only one of which can be used at any given time for a single value (i.e.&nbsp;only one of <code>Red</code>, <code>Green</code>, or <code>Blue</code> can be in use for a single value of type <code>MyColor</code>), a product type has a single constructor with multiple fields, all of which must be filled in for a single value (for any value of <code>MyUserType</code> both strings must be provided to <code>MyUser</code>). Notice the inverted relationship between multiple and single between the two (i.e. multiple type constructors vs single type constructor and single variant in use vs multiple fields must all be filled in). This sort of “dual” inversion will show up a lot more later on.</p>
<p>Even though the two are complements to one another, statically typed programming languages in general seem to favor product types over union types. You see this with languages like Java that allow for the creation of product types (i.e.&nbsp;Java classes), but have no union types. Statically typed FP languages such as Elm address this imbalance by also allowing union types. This unlocks a host of data modeling goodies and is the core of how Elm allows us to create “correct by construction” models that make errors unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Elm, however, goes further than some other statically typed FP languages and bestows more power to product types through record types and extensible record types. These essentially are product types on steroids. To see that records are fundamentally product types, note that you could in theory replace every record type with a product type, it’d just make for really annoying code because all of a sudden your fields are all anonymous and position-based.</p>
<p>However, Elm, in a fashion that somewhat echoes Java’s choice to disadvantage union types, doesn’t provide equivalent power to union types. The rest of this post is an exploration in what that might look like if Elm did.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between extensible union types and normal union types, it’s perhaps illuminating to first consider the relationship between record types and normal product types.</p>
<p>Notice that Elm records differ from Elm’s normal product types by being</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Structural: Normal product types in Elm are nominal, that is name-based. Every product type you use must have been declared somewhere and is given an explicit, unique name that is used for typechecking. On the other hand record types are anonymous. Though they can be given a name with <code>type alias</code> that name is non-canonical (the same record type can be given multiple different names) and plays no role in typechecking. In other words <em>the structure of a record type is all that matters to the type checker, not its name.</em></li>
<li>Extensible: Normal product type signatures must specify all possible fields it supports. Extensible records only need to specify a subset of fields and then leave the others unspecified.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to make this clear, here are the three versions of a product type that Elm supports at the current moment.</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm product type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>SomeProductType</span> <span>=</span> <span>ProductTypeConstructor</span> <span>Int</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a><span>-- Normal Elm record, notice the type alias rather than type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>SomeRecord</span> <span>=</span> { <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>-- Extensible Elm record, notice the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>ExtensibleRecord</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> { <span>a</span> <span>|</span> <span>field0</span> : <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>field1</span> : <span>String</span> }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Extensible union types introduce these two features, namely making a type structural and extensible, to union types. I find actual code to often be hepful here, so I’m going to introduce some hypothetical Elm syntax here.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>-- Normal Elm sum type</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a><span>type</span> <span>User0</span> <span>=</span> <span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>|</span> <span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type, again note that this is a type alias</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User1</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7"></a><span>-- Hypothetical extensible union type actually using the extensible portion,</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8"></a><span>-- note the type variable</span></span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9"></a><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User2</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s go over <code>User1</code> and <code>User2</code> in more detail. Names prefixed with a an <code>@</code> symbol such as <code>@RegularUser</code> are extensible union tags. These play an analogous role to field names in a record type. That is <code>@RegularUser Int</code> is an independent type in the same way <code>{ field0 : Int }</code> is an independent type, rather than just a value like <code>RegularUser Int</code>.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>@</span><span>SomeVariantTag</span> <span>MyType</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>      <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>{ <span>recordField</span> : <span>MyType</span> }</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a>  <span>^</span> <span>tag</span> <span>name</span>    <span>^</span> <span>tagged</span> <span>type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Likewise, just like record field names can be used as the value level to directly create a value, extensible union tags can be used at the value level to directly create a value.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> : <span>User1</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>-- Equivalently</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @RegularUser Int or @AdminUser String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a><span>-- or</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a><span>-- someRegularUser : @AdminUser String or @RegularUser Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a><span>-- Notice just like for record fields the order doesn't matter</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a><span>-- This is different from a normal sum type where Result String Int is</span></span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a><span>-- different from Result Int String</span></span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a><span>someRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we could also have assigned this type</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>someOtherRegularUser</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> : <span>@</span><span>Blah</span> <span>String</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>Blahblah</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a><span>lotsOfIrrelevantVariants</span> <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now let’s leave aside why all these type signatures work other than to hand-wave it and say they all make sense if you think of “or”. We’ll return to that in just a bit when we look close at extensible types. Instead, let’s look at how to actually work with extensible unions.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the only thing you can do with a product type is pull out its fields. On the flip side, fundamentally the only thing you can do with a union type is pattern match on its variants with a case statement.</p>
<p>This remains true for extensible unions, which have their own associated case statement for pattern matching on them, introduced by <code>case#</code> instead of <code>case</code> (you could unify them as a single <code>case</code> statement, but I’m separating them for clarity here).</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>toInt</span> : <span>@</span><span>RegularUser</span> <span>Int</span> <span>or</span> <span>@</span><span>AdminUser</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span>toInt</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>case</span><span>#</span> <span>user</span> <span>of</span></span>
