<p>The software has poured into almost all areas of our lives throughout the
years. It remembers phone numbers of our loved ones, it finds the best route to
a well-reviewed restaurant we want to eat in, and many many more things. This
ever-presence of software engineering in our day-to-day things brings all
kinds of questions on what is ethical and what is not.</p>
<p>The topic of ethics is significant for us programmers (developers) who
produce living and breathing pieces of code every day. Those pieces of code can
change and affect other people’s lives. So, is being ethical in your work worth
it? And what to do when presented with questionable requirements from your
superiors?</p>
<p>These are all hard questions and topics, but let’s try to break them together.</p>
<h2 id="to-bully-or-to-be-bullied"><a href="#to-bully-or-to-be-bullied" aria-label="to bully or to be bullied permalink"></a>To Bully, or To Be Bullied</h2>
<p>I recently came about a tweet where a company was being called out for planning
to build features that would do surveillance on their users. Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The surveillance regime marches on. This is Clockify promising a road map of ever-more oppressive and dehumanizing tracking of employees. If we're just being HONEST here, I'd like to see this blown into a million bits. Source code encrypted and the key lost. Just awful. <a href="https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp">https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>A company named Clockify, which provides time-tracking features to their users,
exposed a road-map where they will do screenshots and GPS tracking of their
users. Of course, somebody took the picture in the tweet out of context. The
idea was to provide these features to only some portion of their users who
would pay for them. I am not saying it to justify the features they
are adding, just trying to put more context into the conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of watching over someone while they work is appalling to me,
and I would never work or run a company that does this. What’s more
intriguing to me is the dilemma of what do you do when you work for such a company. We will
always have some persona on social media that will bash the shit out
of ideas like user surveillance, but what can a ground-level developer like
you and me do in this situation?</p>

<p>Let’s say you work in that company, and someone asked you to build a feature that
tracks what users do on their computers. Would you stand up and say a hard ‘no’
to the management? Or, would you nod your head and leave a 👍 reaction.
Answering this question is hard. But to make it a bit easier, I would like to
remind you that even as an engineer, you can be held accountable, even though
you are not the ‘mastermind’ behind all of it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to scare you or anything, but did you know that Volkswagen’s
engineer got sentenced to more than three years in prison for being involved in a
scheme that allowed VW to sell diesel cars that generated more pollution than
it was allowed? You can read all about it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-sentencing/vw-engineer-sentenced-to-40-month-prison-term-in-diesel-case-idUSKCN1B51YP">here</a>.
You decide if it was worth it for that guy.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-oath"><a href="#taking-the-oath" aria-label="taking the oath permalink"></a>Taking the oath</h2>
<p>No matter what job you do as a developer. You had to start somewhere. Some
folks took the university route. Some did the online courses at
home and honed their craft. But no matter what you did, rarely anyone had a
class or a course to them a thing or two about ethics.</p>
<p>In other professions, such as have their documents with core values and
standards. The most famous one is, of course, the Hippocratic oath medical
doctors need to take. Doctors promise to care responsibly for their patients
and learn ethics as part of their education. It is crucial for doctor’s
patients to feel confident that the doctor has their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>We should have something similar in our line of work but applied
more often. There are a couple of examples where people put together documents
that describe what ethics for software engineers is. For example, the world’s
largest educational and scientific computing society - ACM - has a
<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
Check it out, it is an interesting read.</p>
<p>I am not saying that enforcing all computing professionals to take some oath
will drop the surveillance or other unethical software to drop to
zero. People will try to go out of the way whatever we do. What we need to do
instead is to teach about ethics in computer science <strong>more</strong> since our actions
can impact the world more than ever.</p>
<h2 id="field-studies"><a href="#field-studies" aria-label="field studies permalink"></a>Field studies</h2>
<p>An interesting thing I found is that StackOverflow asked a couple of questions
about ethics in 2018 (now two years ago). It turns out that most of the developers
(58.5% to be precise) back then said that they would refuse to write code for
an unethical purpose. Also, a huge portion (almost 80%) said that developers have an
obligation to consider the ethical implications of their code, which is relieving.</p>
<p>Alongside these numbers of ethics awareness, there were a lot of ethical grays.
Devs are not entirely sure who would they report ethical problems. Furthermore,
developers think differently about who is ultimately responsible
for the unethical code. Right there, in those two spots, I see a lot of room for
improvement. There is potential to educate companies and teams and have go-to
persons to report unethical claims in establishments.</p>
<p>I wonder how the survey would perform if the same questions get asked this year. If
you’re interested in the survey, you can check it out
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#ethics">on StackOverflow here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-is-it-worth-it"><a href="#so-is-it-worth-it" aria-label="so is it worth it permalink"></a>So, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on who you ask. If you are a person responsible for a company’s income,
your best interest is to see trends on charts go in the upwards
direction. How you do it, it might now be the most ethical way, but you are
still crushing it. Or are you?</p>

<p>I am going back to the example of the Clockify (or Hubstaff, or any other time-tracking)
product. The new features that go over the ethics will probably be the most
expensive ones, and could provide more profit for the company. Is that a good
thing? Not always, I believe. If you’re chasing to increase those fancy
acronyms (ARR and MRR) and do not care about the ethics (and the world) - then
I think it is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, the income will come quicker, but the broader impact on the world can be
detrimental. Imagine if all the time-tracking companies will slowly move to
this approach and that surveillance will become the norm in these apps.</p>
<p>So, in the end, no, I <strong>do think being ethical in your work is worth it</strong>. Maybe
not in a quantifiable way or in a way where you can plot a chart and show it to
your manager. Definitely, the actions you decide to take or not to take can
impact those around you. I feel that the fact that we can influence other
people’s lives is something we, as programmers, often overlook. And we shouldn’t
do that, because what’s most important to remember is that we are all in this
together.</p>
<h2 id="action-points"><a href="#action-points" aria-label="action points permalink"></a>Action points</h2>
<p>Where to go now? I recommend reading or going through a couple of resources here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics">Programming ethics on Wikipedia</a> - provides a good summary</li>
<li><a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> - in-depth example of an ethics code</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> - great book overall</li>
<li><a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ethical-programming-professional/">What It Takes To Be an Ethical Programming Professional</a> - an insightful blog post</li>
<li>If going through an online course is your thing, maybe try one of those</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, being ethical won’t be easy, and it won’t look great at times. The
most critical takeaway from this post is to spend time to set up your ethical
boundaries. From then on, it is easier to have conversations and ask questions
like - “is this in the best interest of our users?” and “how does this affect
our organization’s reputation?“.</p>
<p>I hope this post brought some insight or, at least, reminded you that something
like ethics still exists in our profession. If you like topics like these,

December 15, 2020 | https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/">archive.org</a>

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'

}

  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {

  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'

    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''

}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params

  param=''

    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;

<p><a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">Mypy</a> is an optional static type checker for Python. It's been around since 2012 and is gaining traction even since. One of the main benefits of using a type checker is getting errors at "compile time" rather than at run time.</p>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking is a common feature of type checkers, and a very useful one! In this article I'm going to show you <strong>how you can get mypy to perform exhaustiveness checking!</strong></p>

<h2 id="exhaustiveness-checking"><a href="#exhaustiveness-checking">Exhaustiveness Checking</a></h2>
<p>Say you have a system to manage orders. To represent the status of an order, you have the following enum:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You also have the following code to process an <code>Order</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the order is ready, you ship it; and when it's shipped, you charge it.</p>
<p>A few months go by and your system becomes big. So big in fact, that you can no longer ship orders immediately, and you add a new status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
<span>    <span>Scheduled</span> <span>=</span> <span>'scheduled'</span>
</span>    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you push this change to production, you run a quick check with mypy to make sure everything is OK:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Mypy does not see anything wrong in this code, Do you? The problem is that <strong>you forgot to handle the new status in your function</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to make sure you always handle all possible order statuses is to add an assert, or throw an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled status "{status}"'</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, when you execute the function with the new status <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>, you will get a runtime error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>)</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Unhandled</span> <span>status</span> <span>"OrderStatus.Scheduled"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way to with deal with cases like this is to go over your test suite and add scenarios in all the places that use order status. But... if you forgot to change the function when you added the status, what are the chances you'll remember to update the tests? That's not a good solution...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking in Mypy</strong></p>
<p>What if mypy could warn you at "compile time" about such cases? Well... it can, using this little magic function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NoReturn</span>
<span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>def</span> <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled value: {value} ({type(value).__name__})'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you dig into the implementation, try to use it to see how it works. In the function above, place <code>assert_never</code> after you handled all the possible order statuses, where you previously used <code>assert</code> or raises an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, check the code with Mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal[OrderStatus.Scheduled]"</span><span>;</span>
expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
Found <span>1</span> error in <span>1</span> file <span>(</span>checked <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Amazing! <strong>Mypy warns you about a status you forgot to handle!</strong> The message also includes the value, <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>. If you use a modern editor such as VSCode you can get these warnings immediately as you type:</p>
<figure><img alt="mypy Error in VSCode" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-python-mypy-exhaustive-checking.png"><figcaption>mypy Error in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now go ahead and fix your function to handle the missing status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Pending</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'schedule order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>
</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check with mypy again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! You can now rest assure you handled all order statuses. The best part is that you did that with <strong>no unit tests</strong>, and there were <strong>no runtime errors</strong>. If you include mypy in your CI, the <strong>bad code will never make it into production</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enumeration-types"><a href="#enumeration-types">Enumeration types</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section you used mypy to perform exhaustiveness check on an <code>Enum</code>. You can use mypy, and <code>assert_never</code> to perform exhaustiveness check on other enumeration types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Union</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Union</code> type represents several possible types. For example, a function that casts an argument to <code>float</code> can look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>
</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check the function with mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"float"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whoops... you forgot to handle the <code>float</code> type in the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>):</span>
</span><span>        <span>return</span> <span>num</span>
</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! mypy is happy...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Literal</strong></p>
<p>Another useful type is <code>Literal</code>. It is included in the built-in <code>typing</code> module since Python3.8, and prior to that it is part of the complementary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/" rel="noopener"><code>typing_extensions</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>Literal</code> is used to type primitive values such as strings and numbers. <code>Literal</code> is also an enumeration type, so you can use exhaustiveness checking on it as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing_extensions</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

<span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>'G'</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_color_name</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>Color</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'R'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Red'</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'G'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Green'</span>
    <span># elif color == 'B':</span>
    <span>#     return 'Blue'</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Checking the code without the commented part will produce the following error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal['B']"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very handy indeed!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="type-narrowing-in-mypy"><a href="#type-narrowing-in-mypy">Type Narrowing in Mypy</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what <code>assert_never</code> can do, you can try and understand how it works. <code>assert_never</code> works alongside <strong>"type narrowing"</strong>, which is a mypy feature where the type of a variable is narrowed based on the control flow of the program. In other words, mypy is gradually eliminating possible types for a variable.</p>
<p>First, it's important to understand how various things translate to a <code>Union</code> type in mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[int, None]</span>

<span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[Literal['string'], Literal[42], Literal[True]]</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Suit</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Clubs</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♣"</span>
    <span>Diamonds</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♦"</span>
    <span>Hearts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♥"</span>
    <span>Spades</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♠"</span>

<span>Suit</span>
<span># ~Equivalent to Union[</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Clubs],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Diamonds],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Hearts],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Spades]</span>
<span># ]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To display the type of an expression, mypy provides a useful utility called <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#reveal-type" rel="noopener"><code>reveal_type</code></a>. Using <code>reveal_type</code> you can ask mypy to show you the inferred type for a variable at the point it's called:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span># Revealed type is Union[Suit, None]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the function above, the reveled type of <code>suit</code> is <code>Union[Suit, None]</code>, which is the type of the argument <code>suit</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you haven't done anything in the function, so mypy is unable to narrow down the type. Next, add some logic and see how mypy narrows down the type of the variable <code>suit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span>    <span># Revealed type is Suit</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After eliminating the option of suit being <code>None</code>, the revealed type is <code>Suit</code>. Mypy used your program's logic to narrow the type of the variable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the type <code>Suit</code> is equivalent to the type <code>Union[Literal[Suit.Clubs], Literal[Suit.Diamonds], Literal[Suit.Hearts], Literal[Suit.Spades]]</code>, so next, try to narrow down the type even more:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

<span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After checking if <code>suit</code> is <code>Suit.Clubs</code>, mypy is able to narrow down the type to <code>Suit.Clubs</code>. Mypy is also smart enough to understand that if the condition does not hold, the variable <em>is definitely not</em> <code>Clubs</code>, and narrows down the type to <code>Diamonds</code>, <code>Hearts</code> or <code>Spades</code>.</p>
<p>Mypy can also use other conditional statements to further narrow the type, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Diamonds or Spades"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Hearts]</span>
</span><span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The B-Tree mechanism stays the same, but the values that are being sorted are now for example <code>28-182</code>.</p><p>This explains why the index wouldn’t help with trying to run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>In the tree, values like <code>28-182</code> are not sorted by height. They are sorted by age, and then for every individual age they are sorted by height.</p><p>On the other hand, the index would help us with this query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>AND</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tldr-too-long-didnt-read">TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read)</h3><ul><li>B-Tree is the default index in many databases.</li><li>Is it so popular because it’s fast, efficient and flexible.</li><li>It makes operations like <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> or even <code>LIKE</code> faster.</li><li>A rule of thumb would be: if you need to speed up the above operations, use a B-Tree index unless there is a specific reason not to.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/">https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/</a></li><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284</a></li></ul><h2 id="hash-indexes">Hash indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase-1">Usecase</h3><p>We’re only querying using the <code>=</code> operator and we’re having very specific scaling/performance issues (e.g. our table is huge and a B-Tree would be too large to fit in memory). We want to index:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Souleymane Laurence'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a Hash index on the <code>name</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_name <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> <span>USING</span> HASH (name);
</code></pre></div><p>This time, we need to specify it explicitely by adding <code>USING HASH</code> to our statement.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work-1">How does it work</h3><p>Let’s think of our <code>user</code> table as a Java array for one second. We consider the position in the array to be equivalent to a <code>tid</code> in Postgres:</p><p>That’s how we’d naively lookup the users having the name <code>Souleymane Laurence</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java">User<span>[]</span> userTable <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> i<span>;</span>
List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> foundTids <span>=</span> <span>new</span> ArrayList<span>&lt;&gt;();</span>

<span>// Iterating over the rows of our table to find our values in the array.
</span><span></span><span>for</span> <span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 0<span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> userTable<span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>if</span> <span>(</span>userTable<span>[</span>i<span>].</span><span>name</span> <span>==</span> <span>"Souleymane Laurence"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
		foundTids<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is slow because we have to go over all the entries of the table one by one (remember, they could be hundreds of millions in a database).</p><p>Now couldn’t we find a way to remove this big for loop and predict in advance where are our rows going to be located in the array? Yes! And it’s called a <strong>hash function</strong>.</p><p>A hash function is capable of taking any input and translating it into a smaller subset of values:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Returns an int between 0 and 256. Always the same for the same input.
</span><span></span>hash_function_256<span>(</span><span>"Souleymane Laurence"</span><span>)</span>
<span>-&gt;</span> 147
</code></pre></div><p>We could use this as an array position! We just need to rearrange our table first:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java">User<span>[]</span> userTable <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> i<span>;</span>
List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[]</span> hashIndex <span>=</span> <span>new</span> List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[</span>256<span>];</span> <span>// 256 hash values
</span><span></span>
<span>// Iterating over the rows of our table to populate our index.
</span><span></span><span>for</span> <span>(</span>i <span>=</span> 0<span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> userTable<span>.</span><span>length</span><span>;</span> i<span>++)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>int</span> hash <span>=</span> hash_function<span>(</span>userTable<span>[</span>i<span>].</span><span>name</span><span>)</span>
	hashIndex<span>[</span>hash<span>].</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We just created our own hash index. Let’s now run our query again:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>// Our new index.
</span><span></span>List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;[]</span> hashIndex <span>=</span> <span>{...}</span>

<span>int</span> hash <span>=</span> hash_function_256<span>(</span><span>"Souleymane Laurence"</span><span>)</span>
List<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> foundTids <span>=</span> hashIndex<span>[</span>hash<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s it, and that was quick as hell 🔥. Back to SQL:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'Souleymane Laurence'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/hash.png" alt="hash"></p><h3 id="tldr">TLDR</h3><ul><li>The hash index was never very popular for a few reasons:<ul><li>Before Postgres 10, hash indexes were not properly supported. In particular they were not recorded in the write-ahead log so they could not be recovered after a failure/incident.</li><li>They only index the <code>=</code> operator and also don’t help with sorting. They’re not very flexible and for <code>=</code>, the B-Tree does the job very well too.</li></ul></li><li>So why should you use a hash index? Probably you shouldn’t. But they are smaller in size and can be faster than B-Trees so they can be useful under certain conditions. The read time being constant (<code>O(1)</code> vs <code>O(log n)</code> for B-Trees), they could for example benefit us for a high throughput of lookups by ID on a huge table.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation-1">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/442776">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/442776</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@jorsol/postgresql-10-features-hash-indexes-484f319db281">https://medium.com/@jorsol/postgresql-10-features-hash-indexes-484f319db281</a></li></ul><h2 id="gin-generalized-inverted-index">GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)</h2><h3 id="usecase-2">Usecase</h3><p>GIN indexes are mostly useful for indexing multi-valued columns (e.g. arrays, full-text search).</p><p>Let’s add a <code>favorite_colors</code> column to our users:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMN</span> favorite_colors TEXT[];
</code></pre></div><p>We want to be able to index a query that looks up users that have <code>red</code> and <code>blue</code> in their favorite colors:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> favorite_colors <span>@&gt;</span> <span>'{red,blue}'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We now create a GIN index:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_favorite_colors <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> <span>USING</span> GIN (favorite_colors);
</code></pre></div><h3 id="how-does-it-work-2">How does it work</h3><p>Spoiler alert: GIN indexes are actually custom B-Trees where the multi-valued columns (arrays for example) are flattened 😱.

So it’s perfect for a Raspberry Pi, but also for a server or a desktop usage.<br>By the way, the FreeBSD FAQ is pretty clear about this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Can FreeBSD replace my current operating system?<br></strong>For most people, yes.</p><cite><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#:~:text=the%20FreeBSD%20Handbook.-,1.2.,any%20purpose%20without%20strings%20attached." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBSD documentation</a></cite></blockquote><p>We’ll see in the next parts how to install it on your Raspberry Pi, but it’s also a solid system for your computer or on server.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD has been adopted by many companies over the world.<br></strong>I already told you about Pfsense, but other brands like IBM, Apple or Sony are using parts of the FreeBSD code (for example, the PlayStation 4 system is a fork from FreeBSD).<br>Some NAS operating systems are also based on FreeBSD (FreeNAS for example).</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_vs_Linux"></span>FreeBSD vs Linux<span></span></h3><p>As I told you in introduction, <strong>FreeBSD is not a Linux-based system</strong>.<br>Systems on Linux, are all using the same kernel and basic drivers, and then add many applications to offer a specific solution at the end.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD don’t use this base, they develop and release everything, including the kernel and drivers.</strong><br>However, the differences while using it are minimal (I will show you the main ones).<br>But you may have some commands working differently on Linux and FreeBSD.</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_strengths"></span>FreeBSD strengths<span></span></h3><p>So, why do I need to try FreeBSD if it’s almost the same thing?<br>As always when I test systems, the main goal here is to experiment, and see how it works. So you’ll get more details at the end.</p><p>But in theory, <strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span>FreeBSD is a minimal system that should be faster, more secure and with less compatibility issues than most Linux systems</strong>.<br>We’ll see now if this is true for the Raspberry Pi version 🙂</p><h2><span id="Install_FreeBSD_on_Raspberry_Pi"></span>Install FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi<span></span></h2><p>In this part, we’ll see how to install a basic FreeBSD system on your Raspberry Pi.</p><h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_4"></span>Raspberry Pi 4<span></span></h3><p>During writing this tutorial, <strong>the Raspberry Pi 4 is not yet supported on the RELEASE version</strong> (12.x). But it works on CURRENT version (13.x).</p><p>So, if you have a Raspberry Pi 4, consider taking the latest version available. Currently, the 13.x and above are the only working for Raspberry Pi 4.<br>Unfortunately, if t’s a CURRENT version, it’s a debug one, with less stability and performances issues. But for a test it’s ok.</p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-leader-1"></span>The other option is to use a custom firmware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4"

<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident. </strong></p><p>Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising "fabricated and false" accusations, "with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>The year was 1996, and it’s the 11th of November. Macarena is topping the charts, Bill Clinton wins his second presidential term, and an article in a very peculiar e-zine is published which would change the world of information security forever. The publication in question was Phrack, an e-zine for and by hackers. The article in question was Aleph One’s “Smashing the Stack for fun and profit”, thus began what many regards as the golden age of software exploitation.</p>
<p>Smashing the stack for fun and profit was the first-ever article to in detail describe the buffer overflow vulnerability. Sure, buffer overflows were already being exploited in the wild prior to the release of Aleph One paper, but it had never been documented to this extent before. A lot has happened since the golden days. We have 64 bit-systems, compiler protections, kernel protections, and so on. While the examples from the paper aren’t possible without some dangerous compiler tweaks, the essence of the stack-based buffer overflow is still the same.</p>
<h2>Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>So, what is a buffer overflow? An easy way to explain it is to imagine a spreadsheet containing a list of items. Each item has an id, a name, and a price. Imagine has implemented a very poor system for updating the items.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if someone entered in a bunch of A’s while updating the name? Since this terrible spreadsheet app lacks bounds checking on the name, the value of name overflows into the price field. Now the price of the third item is 9 A’s. If we think a little more creatively about this, this means that we are able to write anything we want to the price field by carefully crafting a payload, that allows us to set the price to 1. Now that would be bad for business.</p>
<p>Ok, now we know the essence of what a buffer flow is, but what about the stack?</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>Imagine a stack of plates, you can put (push) another plate on top of the already stacked plates, and you can remove a plate (pop) from the stack. I won’t go into great detail about how it works, but what you need to know is that each program executed by the operating system has its own stack, but instead of dinner plates the stack stores stack frames. You see, every time a program calls a function, it pushes a new stack frame on the stack. This frame contains the parameters for the function, its variables, and data needed to get back to the previous frame.</p>
<h2>The Return Pointer</h2>
<p>An important part of data needed to return from the function is the return pointer. It stores the memory address for where to resume execution after a function has been called. You can think of this part of the stack frame as the price field from the spreadsheet example. If you can overwrite the return pointer, you may redirect the code flow of the program.</p>
<h2>Exploitation</h2>
<p>But how do we redirect the code flow? The classic way, as described in smashing the stack, is to use shellcode. Shellcode is raw machine code, which typically executes a command shell. The attack creates the payload, by figuring out how much input is needed in order to overflow the return pointer. This is typically done by trial and error with the aid of a debugger. Next, the attacker uses the debugger to find the location of where the shellcode will end up in memory. If the exploit is successful, it will overflow the return address with the location of the shellcode, start executing the shellcode.</p>
<p>Now a lot has happened since the 90s, and the buffer overflow like it is presented in smashing the stack for fun and profit is no longer exploitable on modern systems. However, as application hardening evolved so did the techniques for exploitation.</p>
<p>The first defense against these sorts of attacks was NX, non-executable stack. This mitigation prevents code being executed in regions of the stack meant for data. This mitigation prevents the use of shellcode on the stack, but from this a very clever trick was discovered.</p>
<h2>Return-To-Libc</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the return pointer has to point to a valid memory address. We cannot redirect code execution to somewhere on the stack, as it is marked as non-executable. But what if we point it to somewhere that already exists? Enter the return-to-libc technique. The concept is simple, we jump to a already existing function that will allow us to get code execution. There's multiple way to do this, but the most popular is to jump to the c library function <code>system()</code>.</p>
<p>We can't jump directly into <code>system()</code>, as it needs to be called with a useful string such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. In order to pull this off, we can leverage program instructions that modify cpu registers or the stack, as long as they are followed by a return instruction. The return instruction moves the stack pointer, meaning that we can chain together multiple instructions, as it will return into the next memory address we supply on the chain. These instructions are known as gadgets. By using this technique, we can write the string <code>bin/sh</code> in the register that is used as the first function parameter (on 32-bit systems, functions parameters are pushed onto the stack instead).</p>
<h2>ROP</h2>
<p>Actually, we don't even need access to library functions at all. If we chain together enough gadgets in a clever way, we can execute directly by using a system call. This is known as return-oriented programming (ROP) and is actually Turing complete! Meaning we can make the program to behave in any way we desire. Some people have actually implemented programming languages that run on top of a vulnerable program using return-oriented programming!</p>
<h2>Stack Cookies, ASLR and PIE</h2>
<p>Further attempts were made to stop exploitation, but they only succeed at making exploitation more involved. Like stack cookies, a special numeric value placed before the return pointer. If you corrupt this value, execution will terminate. However, these can be leaked and in some cases brute-forced.</p>
<p>Next we have ASLR, or address space layout randomization. This mitigations offsets memory addresses with a random value. This can be defeated by leaking addresses in order to calculate the offset.</p>
<p>The last one we're going to cover is Position Independent Executables or PIE for short. This mitigation is used in combination with ASLR. PIE randomly shuffles each section of the program i.e., we no longer know where anything is in memory. This makes leaking a lot more complicated, but it is defeatable by getting the right memory leaks.</p></section></article></div></div>]]>

I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<h3><a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/intermediatepythongithubio/latest/intermediatepythongithubio.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>

<p> Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>



<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap. The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><p>Nexus is a library originally authored by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/tgriesser">Tim Griesser</a> that allows developers to build code-first and type-safe GraphQL APIs. Prisma has been a core contributor to the library for over two years and has helped shape its evolution.</p><p>Today, we're happy to announce that we've released Nexus 1.0.</p><p>This release is the culmination of outstanding community feedback and contributions, years of battle-testing Nexus in production, and responding to lessons learned in creating an excellent developer experience for those building GraphQL APIs.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Prisma's products are no longer GraphQL-centric. You can use Prisma in a REST API, a GraphQL API, or in any other setting where you want to access a database in Node or Go. Although we contribute to Nexus, it is not necessary to use it alongside Prisma. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Find out more</a> about what Prisma offers and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus"><a href="#what-is-nexus" aria-label="what is nexus permalink"></a>What is Nexus?</h2><p>Nexus offers a way to build code-first GraphQL APIs in Node. The code-first approach to building a GraphQL API is in contrast to the (potentially more common) schema-first approach.</p><p>Most developers that are new to building GraphQL APIs start out by taking the schema-first approach that has been popularized by companies like Apollo and their Apollo Server offering.</p><p>With the schema-first approach, writing the GraphQL API requires a set of <strong>type definitions</strong> and accompanying <strong>resolvers</strong>. A simple schema-first server might look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
type Query <span>{</span>
  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  posts<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
      title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
      body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.</p><p>Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL APIs. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus, schemas and resolvers are written in the same spot using code.</p><p>Refactoring the Post example above to Nexus would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> objectType<span>,</span> queryType<span>,</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

          body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre><p>There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus, including:</p><ul><li>Schema and resolver co-location</li><li>SDL and type generation</li><li>No need for extra tooling</li></ul><h3 id="schema-and-resolver-co-location"><a href="#schema-and-resolver-co-location" aria-label="schema and resolver co location permalink"></a>Schema and Resolver Co-location</h3><p>When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.</p><p>As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.</p><p>With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.</p><h3 id="automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation"><a href="#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation" aria-label="automatic type and schema definition language generation permalink"></a>Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation</h3><p>One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.</p><p>Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the <code>makeSchema</code> call.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span>
<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-to-nullability"><a href="#changes-to-nullability" aria-label="changes to nullability permalink"></a>Changes to Nullability</h3><p>In previous versions of Nexus, fields were treated as non-nullable by default. This differed from other GraphQL API frameworks which would treat fields as nullable unless otherwise specified. The Nexus authors took this approach because allowing fields to be non-nullable by default posed some long-term risks for API development.</p><p>The default nullability for fields has now been inverted in Nexus so that we can align with GraphQL best practices and expectations, specifically from the authors of GraphQL.</p><p>At Nexus 1.0, you need to explicitly make fields non-null:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>The code for the <code>Post</code> object type above uses a property called <code>nonNull</code> which offers a bit more flexibility for specifying that fields should be non-null. It's useful for situations where the chaining API is not ideal, such as expressing deeply-nested types and when programmatically creating non-nullable types.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> queryType<span>,</span> stringArg<span>,</span> nonNull <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>nonNull</code> function accepts an argument which can be used to specify the type for a type or argument.</p><p>While fields are now nullable by default, it's possible to change this behavior either globally or at the type level in your Nexus API.</p><div><pre><code><span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  </header>

  <p><em>This article belongs to a series of articles about caching. The code in this article can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease">my Github repo</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">Use TLA+ to Verify Cache Consistency</a>.</em></li>
  <li><em>Redis Implementation for Cache and Database Consistency. (This one)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">last article</a>, we introduced an algorithm (described in paper <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/memcache-fb.pdf">Scaling Memcache at Facebook</a>) that can do a better job to maintain the data consistency between cache and database. We also used TLA+ to model the algorithm and verified it. In this article, we are going to implement the algorithm in real world for Redis. The implementation is very simple and doesn’t need to change Redis itself. It’s implemented it by using Redis script. However, it’s much harder to verify the correctness. In order to do it, I used <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> to test it. If you look at the language analysis for the Github repo, you can see most of them are tests. The Redis script implementation, which is written in Lua, is only 5.1% of the project.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>We’ve described the algorithm in the previous article and even write a TLA+ model for it. But just make it easier for the readers, I’ll briefly describe the algorithm here again. Basically, whenever the client get a value from cache, it will be assigned a unique ID (lease) for the key. When the client writes back a new value, it needs to provide the  key’s newest lease ID. And delete the key will also invalidate all its leases.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation uses <a href="https://redis.io/commands/eval">Redis script</a>, which is written in Lua. It can implement multiple operations and make them atomic. In theory, this can also be done by client, but Redis script provides a consistent implementation across different clients and makes it easier to use. The algorithm is easy, so the implementation is also straight forward. The implementations are under <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease/tree/master/scripts">scripts directory of the repo</a>. These scripts also works for Redis cluster (but I didn’t use Jepsen to test it under cluster mode). Here is an example implementation for get:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span>local</span> <span>key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>'</span></span>..KEYS[<span>1</span>]..<span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>'</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span><span>local</span> <span>token</span> = ARGV[<span>1</span>]
<span> <a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a></span><span>local</span> <span>value</span> = redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>get</span><span>'</span></span>, key)
<span> <a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span><span>if</span> <span>not</span> value <span>then</span>
<span> <a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a></span>    redis.replicate_commands()
<span> <a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a></span>    <span>local</span> <span>lease_key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>lease:</span><span>'</span></span>..key
<span> <a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a></span>    redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>set</span><span>'</span></span>, lease_key, token)
<span> <a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span><span>false</span>, token<span>}</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a></span><span>else</span>
<span><strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span>value, <span>false</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a></span><span>end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After load the script, you can use it like this:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>redis-cli evalsha &lt;script_sha1&gt; 1 &lt;key&gt; &lt;uniq_id&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will return <code>value, nil</code> if there is value for the key, or <code>nil, lease</code> if there is no value.</p>

<p>One optimization here is, if we have value for the key, we will not store the lease. That’s because in our use case, if we can get the value, we will not get it from database and write back to the cache. This avoids a lot of memory overhead.</p>

<p>Another important decision I made is, when get the value, the client needs to provide a unique ID instead of let Redis provide one. This is because I cannot find a good way to generate unique ID in Redis cluster. In a single instance, it’s easy: just use a key and inc the value each time. You can still generate unique IDs for different keys on a cluster, but it adds a lot of memory overhead. So I decided to let clients provide it. Luckily, it’s not hard, basically every language has UUID implementation and that’s good enough.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>It’s easy to implement something, but very hard to make sure it’s correct. We can use TLA+ to model the algorithm and explore the state space, or use mathematical method to proof the correctness in theory. But once we implement the algorithm, it’s something different. We cannot make sure it’s exactly the same as what we’ve proofed. That’s why I find using Coq to implement, proof and generate real code is fantastic. But in this case, it’s not implemented in Coq, so we must find some other way to test it. By testing, we still cannot make sure it’s 100% correct, we can just explore as many situations as we can and make sure the system doesn’t behaves in a way we don’t expect.</p>

<p>The tool we use here is <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a>. It provides lots of tools to make it easy to test distributed systems. It can generate many concurrent requests, import different kinds of failures (host down, network partition, clock drift, and so on) to the system, record all the requests and responses, and check the history at the end.</p>

<p>Here is the test case I write: for each client, generate random read and write operations. For read operation, read from cache first, if the value is not found, read from database and write back to the data. For write operations, write to the database and delete the key from cache. Then after all the read and write operations, check whether the data in cache and database are the same. The test case is very simple, it implemented the way we would use the cache.</p>

<p>By providing different arguments to the test command, you can run the test case with raw Redis get/set/del operations, or use get/set/del operation implemented by the scripts. You can also import cache failure during the test.</p>

<p>If we run the test with raw Redis operations, we can find the test is failed. In the last article, we discussed that using plain get/set/del cache operations cannot guarantee cache consistency, so this is expected. If we run the test with our scripts, we can find the test passed. If we run the test with cache system failure, we can see the test failed, which is also expected from last article. The inconsistent because of cache failure can be resolved by clean up cache data after restart. But if the client is failed, it will have the same problem (I didn’t write the test case for this because it’s hard to test client failure in Jepsen), but it’s not a very good idea to cleanup cache in this case. Because client fails all the time, cleanup cache will make operations slow. The best way might be to setup an expire time so the data can be consistent after the key is expired.</p>

<p>Even though all the test result is expected, it doesn’t make sure the implementation is correct, since there are still many situation I didn’t test, like Redis cluster, network partition, database failure and so on. So welcome to add new test cases and break the system!</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Einstein has once confidently pointed out that under the assumptions of special relativity, matter, anything that has weight, cannot travel faster than constant light speed $c$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to use two mathematical approaches to show that why this is the case.</p>

<h3 id="relativistic-momentum-approach">Relativistic Momentum Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Relativistic-Momentum-Relativistic-Mass/">post</a>, I have derived the expression of relativistic momentum.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
p &amp;= m_r v \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass which does not change with velocity.</p><p>

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]

</p><p>Newtonâ€™s second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
F &amp;= \frac{dp}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(m_r v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(\gamma m_0 v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d(\gamma v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{v^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (-2) v^{-3} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (v^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}}  \frac{dv}{dt} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could easily see that if we apply a constant force to matter, as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \rightarrow \infty$, the apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt} \rightarrow 0$, meaning that the apparent acceleration becomes smaller with the constant force applied on the matter. When $v = c$, to make the matter travel faster than light, you would need to have a tiny apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt}$. However, in this time, since $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} = \infty$, we would need to apply infinity large force $F$ to the matter, which is not plausible.</p>

<h3 id="mass-energy-equivalence-approach">Mass-Energy Equivalence Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Mass-Energy-Equivalence-Derivation/">post</a>, I have also derived the mass-energy equivalence.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
E &amp;= m_r c^2 \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 c^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass.</p>



<p>We could easily see that as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, the Lorentz factor $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$, and the total energy of the matter $E \rightarrow \infty$. Based on the energy conservation, we would need to supply infinity energy to the matter to archive velocity $c$, which is not plausible.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018, we noticed that there was something that set Google apart from other big tech companies. Everybody was talking about how to regulate these tech companies, and everybody had pretty good plans for how to do it — for every company besides Google. In our opinion, it was because nobody really seemed to understand what Google does, or how they do it. So, for the past two years, we’ve been researching and analyzing Google. Through this work, we’ve found some really compelling evidence about what powers Google’s monopoly, so much so that <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/2020/10/07/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report/">Congress referenced this work as part of their recently released Big Tech Antitrust Report</a>. The big ideas that we have is that that crawling the web is a natural monopoly, that Google has control of that monopoly, and that once you understand why this is true and what it means it becomes pretty clear about what sorts of regulations should be taken to reign in Google’s power over the internet. </p>
<p>We have published on this website the economic arguments that we have developed that we think help people understand the foundations of Google and how to regulate<a href="https://knuckleheads.club/understanding-google/"> </a>them. Up until now we have done all this work in private, reaching out to and meeting with regulators on an individual basis. With the publishing of an article about this work in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">The New York Times</a>, we are publishing this research for everyone to read and opening up the club for people to join and participate in researching Google’s monopoly. We have a <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/whats-next/" data-type="page" data-id="2518">solid plan for the next year</a> about how to finish this research and work with legislators and governments to get legislation drafted and introduced to regulate Google’s web crawling advantages. If you find yourself agreeing with what you read on this website and get caught up imagining a better future where the internet isn’t just five big tech companies all cutting deals with each other, please consider <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/join-the-club/" data-type="page" data-id="2444">joining the Knuckleheads’ Club</a> and helping us fight to win a better world. </p>
<p>So, with all that said as an introduction, let’s dive into what Google is exactly. </p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>China’s largest retailer, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business. “A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>JD chose Vitess for scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. “We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data,” says Liu.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in&nbsp;the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.</p>

<h3>China’s largest retailer and the world’s third-largest Internet company by revenue, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business.</h3>



<p>The company also owns China’s largest e-commerce logistics infrastructure, which covers an incredible 99% of the country’s population and has achieved delivery rates of more than 90% of orders delivered same- or next-day.</p>



<p>“A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu, who leads the Technological Infrastructure Department responsible for driving innovation in containerized infrastructure and developing the hyperscale, containerized, Kubernetes-based platform that powers all facets of JD’s business. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<p>The company previously used JProxy, a cobar-based database middleware system for MySQL database management. After a thorough evaluation process, Liu says, “we eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data.”</p>

<p>Being a very early adopter of Vitess—and with one of the largest and most complex deployments of the technology, to boot—came with some challenges. “The re-sharding process was initially manual, the performance was poor, and the orchestrator could fail in large clusters with more than 5,000 instances,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make sure that Vitess would work at JD’s scale, Liu’s team made numerous improvements and changes, including bug fixes and new functionalities and features. They have also developed performance optimization and automated management tools for the company’s JDOS Kubernetes platform. Among them:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>JTransfer, an online data synchronization and transmission tool that migrates data from JD’s traditional MySQL databases to the Vitess cluster in real time. All topology information in Vitess is stored in etcd.&nbsp;</li><li>BinLake, a MySQL collection tool for real-time collection of Binlog in Vitess and traditional MySQL database services, and publication of the collected Binlog to the Message Queue (JMQ) service. Integrated with Vitess, “BinLake provides intelligent and highly available binlog collection services in clusters,” says Liu. “If there is resharding or failover in Vitess, Binlake will automatically adjust the database instance of the binlog.”</li><li>Mole, a Vitess management system with a GUI console, which improves Vitess service management. “With Mole, we can easily create, reshard, monitor, and back up Vitess’s keyspaces,” says Liu.</li></ul>



<p>“Most of our improvements have been contributed back to the Vitess code base for other developers in the community to benefit from,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, “Vitess helped the team grow their technical knowledge and strength in the areas of scalable management and elastic database,” says Liu. “The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community. With CNCF’s endorsement, Vitess can gain increasing awareness, attract more end users and bring together developers to the project. This is very beneficial for Vitess and its end users, which is important to us.”</p>



<p>Liu and his team are excited about the future of Vitess. In addition to migrating its systems to the newly-released Vitess 3.0 (which Liu calls “a significant improvement”), they’re working on developing some common functions for the latest version and developing a more complete operations and maintenance monitoring system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For other organizations considering Vitess, Liu offers this advice: “The most value can be derived from Vitess when it is used in concert with Kubernetes. Before using Vitess, it is imperative to perform more testing and research to determine if Vitess is the right solution for your business, and to better understand what adjustments you might have to make to integrate it with your existing systems.”</p>



<p>For JD, Kubernetes, Vitess, and other cloud native technologies have been a game-changer. “Modern service platforms need to be scalable and extremely efficient and agile,” says Liu. “Cloud native technology is well-suited to handle these ever-changing environments. It offers flexibility, efficiency, scalability, independence, continuous integration and delivery for software services, all of which further enhance the quality of software services and resource efficiency. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard and cloud native is a sure thing to bet on for the future.”</p>

		<p>Well the news is out, I won’t explain the method for reasons, but our code warriors have a new fight. After requesting the SU password, they were told flat out it doesn’t exist and referred to the manual by the vendor. Taking that argument to the telco ombudsman got the same response. If there were one and you wanted to change it for security reasons, it looks like you can’t and with the vendors denying it’s existance, there’s no help coming.</p>
<p>So, the password for the SU account that doesn’t exist…</p>

This blog post is my answer.</p><p>Big O notation (example: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a notation used to describe the time it takes code (example: a function) to execute on a given input (example: an array of integers). A fancy term often used to describe the time it takes code to execute is "time complexity". If you come across the term "time complexity", think "The speed of the code".</p><p>Big O notation is in the form <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(f(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a <em>function</em> of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, meaning for every possible value of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> outputs exactly one answer, and that answer does not change.</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>addOne</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>This article provides practical tips on how to optimize the loading speed of your website. Some advice specifically aims at users of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the blog-enabled static site generator. However, the basic ideas also apply to other tools and should therefore be easy to transfer.</p> <p>Note: This is an article written by and for the occasional web developer. If you’re a professional full-time web developer, you might know much of the content. I still encourage you to continue reading, though!</p> <h2 id="why-care">Why Care?</h2> <p>Why should you care about performance? We’ve got tiny supercomputers in our pockets, so who cares? And aren’t static websites such as those generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> super fast out of the box? Well, not so fast.</p> <p>Performance matters a lot, and tiny improvements can make a vast difference. According to research from Google, the speed it takes to load a page has an impact of around 75% for user experience, clearly above other criteria such as ease of use or attractiveness:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/speed_impact.jpg" alt="Impact of Speed on UX"></p> <p>If you would like to learn more, have a look at this talk from Google’s 2019 I/O conference:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLjxXPHuIJo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> <p>When it comes to static websites the situation surely is not as bad as in other cases. Remember Flash, anyone? However, investigating performance more closely reveals opportunities for optimization even for static sites.</p> <h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h2> <p>First, we need to measure performance before we can optimize it. My current tool of choice is Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a>. You can either run it in a browser through <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a> or online at Google’s <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> pages.</p> <p>Lighthouse not only analyzes raw performance but also provides insight into how well your website performs according to</p> <ul> <li>Accessibility</li> <li>Best practices</li> <li>Search engine optimization</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I got for an older version of my site using Chrome Dev Tools:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_old.jpg" alt="Performance results on old website"></p> <p>That’s quite a bit of red and orange. In contrast, this is what I get after optimization, using <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> this time:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_results.jpg" alt="Performance results on current website"></p> <p>Read on to see how you might get there as well.</p> <h2 id="minification">Minification</h2> <p>Low-hanging fruits first.</p> <p>A straightforward way to reduce the size of your pages is to minify the HTML code. Just like other text-based formats, HTML can be minified by reducing white space, comments, newlines, or optional closing tags.</p> <p>There is a Jekyll plugin that exactly does that job for you: <a href="https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html">jekyll-compress-html</a>. The usage is super simple:</p> <ol> <li>Download the <code>compress.html</code> file from the repository</li> <li>Copy it to the <code>_layouts</code> folder of your Jekyll website</li> <li> <p>Edit your top-level layout file (usually <code>default.html</code>) to have the following front matter:</p>  </li> </ol> <p>This will change your HTML code from something nicely formatted and human-readable to something much more compact. Here is a comparison before and after enabling minification:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/compress_before_after.png" alt="HTML minification example"></p> <p>This saves about 1K in size on a random HTML page of mine. Doesn’t sound too impressive, but Lighthouse already shows some improvement.</p> <h2 id="only-include-what-you-need">Only Include What You Need</h2> <p>From here on things get slightly more complicated, but the gain in speed is also significantly greater. Hang tight.</p> <p>Depending on your Jekyll setup, you eventually include a <em>lot</em> of additional assets like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, or custom fonts. Chances are that you only need a subset of them.</p> <p>I use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build this site (see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">this post</a>), which depends on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Both libraries are quite heavyweight. Turns out I only need a fraction of them, offering an excellent opportunity for size reduction.</p> <h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3> <p>I compile my own version of Bootstrap using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass</a>, see this <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">post</a> for details. Therefore, I can easily configure which CSS modules to include from the Bootstrap distribution. Here is my top-level <code>bootstrap.scss</code> file with all unused modules commented out:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>@import</span> <span>"functions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"variables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"mixins"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"root"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"reboot"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"type"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"images"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"code"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"grid"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"tables"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "forms"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "buttons"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"transitions"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "dropdown"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "button-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "input-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "custom-forms"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"nav"</span><span>;</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"navbar"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "card"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "breadcrumb"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "pagination"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "badge"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "jumbotron"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "alert"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "progress"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "media"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "list-group"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "close"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "toasts"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "modal"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "tooltip"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "popover"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "carousel"; */</span>
<span>/* @import "spinners"; */</span>
<span>@import</span> <span>"utilities"</span><span>;</span>
<span>/* @import "print"; */</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s more than half of the modules, and I’m sure I could optimize this even further after more careful investigation.</p> <h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3> <p>The Bootstrap JavaScript code depends on jQuery, which is quite a heavy library providing a lot of functionality. The good news is: As long as you are only using the CSS part of Bootstrap, you are fine <em>not</em> to include it.</p> <p>Check if you really need the Bootstrap JavaScript modules. If not, just remove the corresponding <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for both from your template and watch your performance score improving.</p> <p>In my case, I still use jQuery to retrieve comments on blog posts via GitHub, see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2018/10/23/blog-comments-using-github.html">here</a> for details. However, instead of including jQuery by default on all pages, I now only include it on blog posts using the comment functionality:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.issue and site.github_comments_repository %}
...
<span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"/js/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
...
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I admit that it is still overkill include jQuery just to retrieve some data from GitHub. I’m sure there are more lightweight alternatives. Can you recommend one? Leave a comment below!</p> <h3 id="mathjax">MathJax</h3> <p>Many technical blogs include support for <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a convenient way to typeset mathematical formulas in your posts. Again, this is quite a heavy dependency pulling in lots of JavaScript code.</p> <p>Similarly, the solution is to use conditional inclusion: Only include MathJax when you really need it. Here, a dedicated front-matter variable in posts needing MathJax support will do the trick:</p> <div><div><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Fancy Post With Lots of Math
mathjax: true
---
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Next, change your layout or include file (depending on where you actually include MathJax) to check for the variable being defined:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.mathjax %}
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/x-mathjax-config"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!--</span> <span>your</span> <span>config</span> <span>here</span> <span>--&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note the <code>async</code> attribute above to enable asynchronous loading of the script. This eventually enhances performance in case you actually use MathJax.</p> <h2 id="deferred-loading">Deferred Loading</h2> <p>As shown above, adding the <code>async</code> attribute to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags is one way to improve page load time for scripts that you absolutely have to load. Using the <code>defer</code> attribute is another alternative. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script">script</a> HTML element documentation for more information.</p> <p>Another commonly used technique is to defer the loading by placing your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the very end of the document. However, you should not need this anymore when using the <code>async</code> or <code>defer</code> attributes.</p> <p>For more information on how to eliminate render-blocking resources, please see the corresponding Google Developers <a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/">page</a>.</p> <h2 id="inline-critical-css">Inline Critical CSS</h2> <p>Another optimization technique is to <em>inline</em> CSS code directly into the HTML document instead of loading an external script. The key point is to inline only <em>critical</em> CSS styles needed to render the first paint and make the core functionality work.</p> <p>I adopted a simple version of this by using an online critical path CSS <a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/">generator</a>. This takes your website URL and the full CSS code as input and generates a small set of critical CSS styles to include directly in your HTML header.</p> <p>The resulting CSS looks far from being optimal, but for the moment it works fine. I am sure there are better alternatives out there. Maybe you know something that integrates well with Jekyll? Comment below, or drop me a <a href="mailto:dsieger@posteo.de">mail</a>.</p> <h2 id="asynchronous-loading-of-css">Asynchronous Loading of CSS</h2> <p>Another tweak I applied was to defer loading of the full CSS files using a <del>hack</del> creative solution based on the media attribute.</p> <div><div><pre><code> <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span>
       <span>href=</span><span>"style.css"</span>
       <span>media=</span><span>"print"</span>
       <span>onload=</span><span>"this.media='all'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that this requires inlining of critical CSS, otherwise you will get ugly “Flashes of Unstyled Content” (FOUC). See the full <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-way-to-load-css-asynchronously/">description</a> at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2> <p>Custom web fonts are popular and available to everyone through services like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. However, ask yourself if you really need them.</p> <p>As an alternative, consider using a system font stack relying on fonts already installed on the user’s system. This offers significant performance gains since</p> <ul> <li>there are no font files to transfer and load</li> <li>the browser likely has the fonts cached</li> </ul> <p>All major operating systems include somewhat decent fonts these days, so this really is an alternative. Plus, the system fonts match the look and feel of the operating system, so users are used to it.</p> <p>Here’s one way to use system fonts:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>-apple-system</span><span>,</span> <span>BlinkMacSystemFont</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Roboto</span><span>,</span> <span>Helvetica</span><span>,</span> <span>Arial</span><span>,</span> <span>sans-serif</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Apple Color Emoji"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI Emoji"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Segoe UI Symbol"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>However, if you are like me and want more precise control over the fonts being used, there are some guidelines to do this efficiently:</p> <ul> <li>Host the fonts yourself if possible. This avoids additional connection requests and/or name resolution.</li> <li>Use <code>font-display: swap</code> in the <code>@font-face</code> definition to make sure text remains visible while the browser loads the fonts.</li> <li>Reduce the size of the font files by sub-setting. Only include the glyphs for the languages you are using.</li> <li> <p>Pre-load essential font files by adding appropriate special tags to your header:</p> <div><div><pre><code>  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"preload"</span>
        <span>href=</span><span>"/font.woff2"</span>
        <span>as=</span><span>"font"</span>
        <span>type=</span><span>"font/woff2"</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ul> <p>Last remark: Popular icon font sets such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> are quite heavy as well. The latter contains something around 1000 icons (depending on your version), and I doubt you really need all of them. Consider creating a customized version containing only the icons you actually use. …</p></div></div>

<li><strong>Leela Chess Zero</strong>, a descendant of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, searches much fewer positions (40 000 per second), using a deep convolutional neural network (trained through millions of games of self-play) to evaluate positions. It has a different search methodology, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo tree search</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neural network employed by Leela Chess Zero is itself fascinating, using <a href="https://lczero.org/dev/backend/nn/">an architecture</a> similar to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01507.pdf">SE-ResNet</a> image classification model. This residual tower of squeeze-and-excitation layers feeds into separate ‘value’ and ‘policy’ heads, for evaluating the position and deciding what to do next, respectively.</p>
<p>However, I want to talk more about the general strategy of searching much fewer positions and expending more effort on each position. In particular, this major difference between Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero is reflected in two of the <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/software">many search programs</a> used to find spaceships in Conway’s Game of Life and related cellular automata:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <strong>ntzfind</strong>, originally written by a pseudonymous author ‘zdr’ and enhanced by Matthias Merzenich, Aidan Pierce, and Tom Rokicki, is a depth-first tree search which uses a huge in-memory lookup table to find all possible choices for the next row based on previous rows.</li>
<li>The new program <strong>ikpx2</strong>, adapted from <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2018/03/11/a-rather-satisfying-winter/">the program I wrote to find the first elementary knightship</a>, is more analogous to Leela Chess Zero in that its search tree is much smaller, but the amount of work done at each node is much greater.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo.png 768w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-300x300.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logo-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></p>
<p>In particular, ikpx2 uses a SAT solver to perform a deep lookahead to determine whether the current partial spaceship can be fully extended for several* more rows, and is therefore not close to a ‘dead end’. By comparison, ntzfind can only rule out a partial by performing a depth-first traversal of the entire subtree.</p>
<p>*this is configurable, but a typical value is 30.</p>
<p>The SAT solvers used are Armin Biere’s <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat">kissat</a> and <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical">CaDiCaL</a>. Kissat is more optimised than CaDiCaL, but doesn’t support incremental solving yet. As such, ikpx2 tries to learn (using basic reinforcement learning, specifically a multi-armed bandit model) which SAT solver is more appropriate for a given task. Theoretically, we could add additional state-of-the-art SAT solvers such as Mate Soos’s <a href="https://www.msoos.org/2020/07/cryptominisat-5-8-0-released/">cryptominisat</a>, and use a more powerful reinforcement learning model (such as a neural network) to evaluate the subproblem and decide which solver to use.</p>
<p>Having this ‘shallow tree with heavy leaves’ means that the current search progress can easily fit entirely within memory. Also, parallelism is easy: we keep a priority queue of tasks (partial spaceships) and have many CPU threads which do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove a task from the queue;</li>
<li>solve it using SAT solvers;</li>
<li>communicate the results back to the main orchestrating thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results that are sent back to the main orchestrating thread are partials that have been extended (for 30 or so rows). A small initial segment of those rows are added to the in-memory tree as nodes; the remaining rows are not, as otherwise we’d end up with the same full unpruned search tree used by ntzfind and therefore our advantage is completely annihilated.</p>
<p>What happens to the remaining rows? Instead of merely discarding them, we take the entire extended partial and simulate it in the cellular automaton! Sometimes these partials evolve into an object that the main search couldn’t have found: for example, the tail might have a higher period than the rest of the spaceship, or leave a trail of debris behind. This idea seems to have first been explored by Paul Tooke in 2001, before being rediscovered 20 years later in the context of ikpx2.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>One of the early new ikpx2 search results using Paul Tooke’s idea was this partial, which evolves into a period-528 puffer engine:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/p528.gif" alt="" width="536" height="134"></p>
<p>Similarly, here is a novel period-21 spaceship found by John Winston Garth. He ran ikpx2 to look for 2c/7 spaceships; within 3 days of running on 12 CPU threads, it had both rediscovered David Eppstein’s <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Weekender">weekender</a> and found <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/object/xq21_7dfxg88gxfd7zw123u2222u321zzweh1r4w4r1hezssoy6ossz12y821/b3s23/">a wholly new period-21 attachment</a> that clings to its tail:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Doodah.gif" alt="" width="418" height="562"></p>
<p>The user ‘iNoMed’ then discovered that two of these could interact to produce an exhaust that can be perturbed by a nearby weekender to emit a forward-moving glider every 42 generations:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rake.gif" alt="" width="198" height="250"></p>
<p>Another feature of ikpx2 is its ability to find objects which have different components of different symmetries. Here, for example, is a spaceship with a symmetric head, asymmetric thorax, and symmetric abdomen. The tail is high-period, again having arisen from simulating a partial rather than from direct SAT solving:</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/symmetry.gif" alt="" width="550" height="120"></h3>
<p>Somewhat disappointingly, ikpx2 has not succeeded in finding any new spaceship velocities in the standard Life rules. I tested it on the same input as the original ikpx used to find Sir Robin; ikpx2 was able to find the same result approximately 50x faster (in terms of core-hours elapsed).</p>
<p>There was a recent near-miss, which would be a (2,1)c/7 spaceship were it not for a single extra cell born in generation 7 (the left configuration, with or without the indicated green triplet, gives rise to the right configuration with the frustrating red tetraplet):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png" alt="" width="961" height="321" srcset="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost.png 961w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-300x100.png 300w, https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/almost-768x257.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px"></p>
<p>The existence of near-misses such as this one makes me hopeful that it will eventually find a (2,1)c/7 spaceship given more time.</p>
<h3>Other cellular automata</h3>
<p>Unlike the original version of ikpx, this version is able to search a wide family of related cellular automata. In particular, it extracts the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine%E2%80%93McCluskey_algorithm">prime implicants</a> from the cellular automaton rule (regarded as a 9-input 1-output boolean function) and uses that to encode the mechanics of the rule into the SAT problems.</p>
<p>In particular, two invocations of ikpx2 were sufficient to find the following growing knightship in the rule Day&amp;Night: one invocation to find the fast (2,1)c/5 frontend which stretches a thick oblique line, and another invocation to find a slower (2,1)c/6 tail which consumes it:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/growing.gif" alt="" width="164" height="341"></p>
<p>Here’s an 11c/22 spaceship in a nonstandard rule found by lemon41625, which is an even better demonstration of the symmetry switching. The discovery consists of odd-symmetric, asymmetric, and even-symmetric components with a high-period exhaust:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lemon_11c22.gif" alt="" width="588" height="116"></p>
<h3>Source code</h3>
<p>The source code for ikpx2 is <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/ikpx2">open-source</a> (released under an MIT licence) so you can experiment with it yourself. It’s currently x86_64-specific, because it has <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera/">apgsearch</a> as a dependency (in order to quickly simulate the partials and examine whether they evolve into anything remotely interesting).</p>

so that once it's built for the first time, we don't need to rebuild it any more. The integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> will be broken
when the assumption does not hold.</p><p>In this release, we fix the integrity of <code>bsb -make-world</code> which allows user to change the dependencies.
The fix is well implementend that people who don't do such modifications will not pay for it.</p><p>This is one of the highest desired feature request based on the
<a href="https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-compiler/issues/4361#issuecomment-739538789" rel="noopener noreferrer">user feedback</a>, so we will expand a bit here why it is tricky
to implement it without compromising performance.</p><p>In ReScript compilation scheme, dependencies as packages are treated as a blackbox,
changes of dependencies should be <em>transitive</em>. The is due to that we have cross module
optimizations and the binary interface itself is a hash of its dependencies.
So for a package dependency chain: A -&gt; B -&gt; C, if A changes and B does not change, C still needs get rebuilt.
Because the intermediate output of B may still change due to the change of A.
To make things worse, each package comes with an installation process which is a shell script, so re-installation will make the
package look like freshly built.</p><p>In this release, we track the installation in the build graph as well, and we calculate the hash of the installation of dependencies and put it in the
dependent's command line flags for building binary artifacts. Such strategy benefits in such aspects: </p><ul><li><p>The calculation of the hash of installation is almost free since it is just one stat, we don't need track all dependencies' artifacts.</p></li><li><p>The introducion of such hashing does not appear in parsing, so that the changes of dependencies will never trigger re-parsing.</p></li><li><p>Once the package installation is a nop, the transitive rebuild graph will be cut off so that we can save some unneeded rebuild.</p></li><li><p>When people make changes to the depdendencies, if such changes don't change the package interface, it will not trigger the build of its dependents.</p></li></ul><h3>Introducing <code>pinned-dependencies</code><span><span><a href="#introducing-pinned-dependencies"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="introducing-pinned-dependencies"></a></span></span></h3><p>To make <code>bsb -make-world</code> more pratical, we also introduce a new concept called: <code>pinned-dependencies</code>.

Note such field only make sense in toplevel's configuration.</p><h3>More robust handling of removal of staled output<span><span><a href="#more-robust-handling-of-removal-of-staled-output"><svg height="0.8em" width="0.8em" viewBox="0 0 20.003 19.944"><path d="M11.927 7.908a4.819 4.819 0 00-3.968-1.3 5.091 5.091 0 00-2.921 1.508L1.47 11.684a4.82 4.82 0 00.192 7.122 4.994 4.994 0 006.76-.4l3.7-3.776a.109.109 0 00-.067-.184s-.649.029-1.132.006a10.116 10.116 0 01-1.35-.226.308.308 0 00-.243.088l-2.529 2.609a2.733 2.733 0 01-3.583.319 2.64 2.64 0 01-.247-3.951l3.755-3.753a2.7 2.7 0 013.654-.073.108.108 0 00.15 0l1.4-1.4a.114.114 0 00-.003-.157z"></path><path d="M8.076 12.036a4.822 4.822 0 003.967 1.3 5.089 5.089 0 002.922-1.509l3.568-3.568a4.818 4.818 0 00-.192-7.121 5 5 0 00-6.761.4l-3.7 3.777a.108.108 0 00.067.183s.648-.028 1.132-.006a10.151 10.151 0 011.35.226.3.3 0 00.243-.088l2.529-2.608a2.732 2.732 0 013.581-.319 2.638 2.638 0 01.249 3.95l-3.755 3.754a2.706 2.706 0 01-3.654.073.107.107 0 00-.15 0l-1.4 1.4a.113.113 0 00.004.156z"></path></svg></a><a id="more-robust-handling-of-removal-of-staled-output"></a></span></span></h3><p>When people delete or rename rescript files, it will introduce dangling staled output, for example, renaming <code>src/A.res</code>

<p>Modern languages like Python, NodeJS, and Go make it easy to handle
concurrent requests for multiple customers at the same time by using threads or goroutines.</p>

<p>Such services seem very cost effective because one process can handle hundreds or thousands
of tenants. However, this efficiency comes at a hidden, steep price. When language runtime
scheduling breaks down, one tenant can cause an outage for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="concurrency-made-simple">Concurrency made simple</h2>

<p>Go makes it trivial to handle concurrency.</p>

<p>Here is an example from <a href="https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1">A Tour Of Go</a> that
launches two goroutines that work independently of each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
	<span>"fmt"</span>
	<span>"time"</span>
)

<span>func</span> <span>say</span>(<span>s</span> <span>string</span>) {
	<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>i</span> &lt; <span>5</span>; <span>i</span><span>++</span> {
		<span>time</span>.<span>Sleep</span>(<span>100</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>.<span>Millisecond</span>)
		<span>fmt</span>.<span>Println</span>(<span>s</span>)
	}
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
	<span>go</span> <span>say</span>(<span>"world"</span>)
	<span>say</span>(<span>"hello"</span>)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Go runtime makes sure that each goroutine gets its fair share of CPU and memory.
It gives the impression that both run in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># GOMAXPROCS sets system threads to 1</span>
<span># This sets up the go language runtime to use one system thread across</span>
<span># all goroutines. Removing this setting will introduce some parallelism,</span>
<span># but will not solve the problems described in this article.</span>
$ GOMAXPROCS<span>=</span><span>1</span> go run main.go
world
hello
hello
world
...</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="language-runtimes-and-multi-tenancy">Language Runtimes and Multi-Tenancy</h2>

<p>Let’s implement a sample Go SaaS that fetches the contents of a URL
for multiple tenants in parallel:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
    <span>"sync"</span>
)

<span>// fetch in our example performs some SaaS work for a tenant,
</span><span>// in this case it gets the URL contents from the internet
</span><span></span><span>func</span> <span>work</span>(<span>wg</span> <span>*</span><span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>, <span>tenant</span> <span>int</span>, <span>url</span> <span>string</span>) {
    <span>defer</span> <span>wg</span>.<span>Done</span>()
    <span>// Don't ignore errors in real code, folks, and close the response body
</span><span></span>    <span>re</span>, <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>url</span>)
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> {
        <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) error -&gt; -&gt;  %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>err</span>)
        <span>return</span>
    }
    <span>defer</span> <span>re</span>.<span>Body</span>.<span>Close</span>()
    <span>fmt</span>.<span>Printf</span>(<span>"Tenant(%v) -&gt; %v\n"</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>re</span>.<span>Status</span>)
}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>// https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sync</span>.<span>WaitGroup</span>{}
    <span>url</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"http://www.golang.org/"</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>tenant</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>; <span>tenant</span> &lt; <span>3</span>; <span>tenant</span><span>++</span> {

</span><span></span>        <span>go</span> <span>work</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>wg</span>, <span>tenant</span>, <span>url</span>)
    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish
</span><span></span>    <span>wg</span>.<span>Wait</span>()
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>My computer runs the program in no time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run simple/main.go 
Tenant<span>(</span>2<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>1<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK
Tenant<span>(</span>0<span>)</span> -&gt; <span>200</span> OK</code></pre></div>
<p>We can imagine that the Go runtime executes the program in the following order:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle0</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle0</span>, <span>goroutine0</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine0</span>)

<span>goroutine0</span> = <span>call</span> <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>args</span>(<span>1</span>, <span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handle1</span> = <span>http</span>.<span>Get</span>(<span>"http://golang.org"</span>)
<span>handles</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>handle1</span>, <span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>sleepingGoroutines</span>.<span>Add</span>(<span>goroutine1</span>)
<span>...</span>
<span>// main program waits until any function returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>...</span> 
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
<span>// main program waits until any other handle returns data from the internet
</span><span></span><span>handle</span> = <span>epoll</span>(<span>handles</span>)
<span>// Continue execution of goroutine 0
</span><span></span>print(<span>response</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>This parallelism and blocking call is an illusion created by a combination of the use of the asynchronous
<a href="https://kovyrin.net/2006/04/13/epoll-asynchronous-network-programming/">epoll</a> Linux function
and Go’s built in runtime scheduler. <code>epoll</code> can efficiently handle thousands of network sockets at once.</p>

<p>The Go runtime activates a smart scheduler to handle <code>go</code> statements - goroutines.
It makes sure that every goroutine gets its share of CPU time and suspends
execution when the function is waiting on network or file input/output.
It’s not unusual to have tens of thousands of goroutines in the system
and see the Go runtime handle the requests well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a more detailed intro to the Go scheduler, take a look at this article
from <a href="https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part2.html">Ardan Labs</a>.</p>

<p>This makes Go a great language for handling concurrent network requests
that constitute the bulk of an average software as a service program that reads and writes to a database
or an external service.</p>

<h2 id="when-fair-scheduling-breaks-down">When fair scheduling breaks down</h2>

<p>Language runtimes do not have full control and visibility into
the resource allocation that is done by the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>This is where the multi-tenancy service promise of fair scheduling breaks down.</p>

<p>Take a look at this number-crunching service that computes factorials on demand:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>

)

<span>// This implementation has a problem, but our code review did not catch it -

        <span>b</span> <span>*=</span> <span>i</span>
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>b</span>
}

}

<span>func</span> <span>main</span>() {
    <span>// wg waits for a collection of goroutines to finish

    }
    <span>// wait for all goroutines to finish

}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, you would not observe the same efficient parallelism.</p>

<p>My execution prints:</p>

<p>Because of the inefficient factorial implementation that took a lot of iterations
and number crunching, tenant 0 consumed all the CPU time and degraded performance for the others.</p>

<p>We can fix the factorial function and add code that limits the possible input numbers.
However, our service has just suffered an outage due to a bug in the code for all our customers,
<a href="https://goteleport.com/resources/videos/workflow-access-pageduty-slack/">PagerDuty</a> is ringing and we are not sleeping again.</p>

<h2 id="a-real-world-example">A real-world example</h2>

<p>I made up our factorial example, but let’s create a real world one using
decompression bombs.</p>

<p>Decompression bombs are specially crafted archives that are small, but expand
into files ranging from tens to thousands of times their size.</p>

<p>They are specifically designed to take down your service. Anyone can download
one <a href="https://bomb.codes/bombs">from the internet</a>.</p>

<p>Some archives use simple techniques like compressing very large files
filled with zeroes. They take advantage of the fact that compression algorithms
represent a huge file with zeroes with a version of <code>repeat billion zeroes here</code>.</p>

<p>More <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_fifield_0.pdf">sophisticated approaches</a>
explore compression techniques in depth and craft evil files
that can explode to petabytes of disk space. The danger is real and lots of programs are
vulnerable on the internet right now.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the effect of such archive on a multi-tenant service.
Our new service unpacks the archive and counts the number of words in a file:</p>

<h2 id="resource-isolation-with-cgroups">Resource isolation with cgroups</h2>

<p>The core of the problem is that CPU time is limited. Programming language runtimes lack
the control and context required to efficiently distribute the CPU time per goroutine.</p>

<p>There is no great solution in the modern programming language runtime that solves

<p>I’ve worked in startups my whole career, first as a software engineer, then as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and most recently <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">as a founder</a>. In that time, the most common question I get from non-technical founders has been, “How can I find a CTO or technical co-founder?”</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-startup-cto-do">What Does a Startup CTO Do?</h2>
<p>First, it’s important to understand that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup CTOs have a very unique role</a>. They are responsible for <em>everything</em> in the software product from writing code for your MVP to hiring engineers to company-wide security. Being a startup CTO is hard - you’re basically doing 13 jobs at once.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qmBywUb.jpg" alt="13 responsibilities of a startup CTO"></a></p>
<p>That said, everyone at a startup is doing a lot, so CTOs aren’t really special. My point is that you aren’t <em>just</em> looking for a software engineer or <em>just</em> an engineering manager. You need someone with a hybrid set of hands-on and higher-level thinking skills. The CTO role is a really difficult one to fill.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for more reading material, I’ve assembled a list of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my favorite books for startup founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="tips-for-finding-a-cto">Tips for Finding a CTO</h2>
<p>While it’s difficult, it’s clearly not impossible for non-technical founders to find a CTO.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">my last two startups</a>, I was the first engineering hire, and I know dozens of others technical co-founders and CTOs in Chicago alone. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as putting together a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-interview-questions">list of interview questions</a> and posting a job listing. After having conversations with several of my CTO friends, I put this list of tips together for non-technical founders looking to attract a technical co-founder or CTO.</p>
<h3 id="1-hone-your-vision">1. Hone Your Vision</h3>
<p>With rare exceptions, technical co-founders are likely not the visionaries. We tend to be more execution-focused, but we are still attracted to founders who have a strong vision for why their product needs to exist. People who join early stage startups <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/11/18/the-millennial-startup-revolution/#51b08ce7622d">tend to be idealists</a>. We know the world doesn’t work the way it should, and we want to be out there making it right.</p>
<p>Founders who have a clear vision that is aligned with something their CTO cares about will get a huge leg up.</p>
<h3 id="2-hone-your-business-plan">2. Hone Your Business Plan</h3>
<p>On the other hand, few engineers are going to be sold on vision alone. The biggest mistake I’ve seen startups make is overbuilding before they validated their market. So when founders approach me, one of the first things I ask is, “How are you going to make money?” followed closely behind, “What have you done to prove that this works?”</p>
<p>Consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreyhaines/">Corey Haines</a> presents it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) What’s your business model?</p>
<p>2) What does “traction” mean with respect to that business model?</p>
<p>3) What is your current traction in that context, and how has it grown over the past couple months?</p>
<p>4) What is your plan for accelerating that traction (give the context of the business model)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your technical founder will know the value he or she brings, so you’ve got to prove yours. As the non-technical founder,
the burden is on you to prove that the business model works.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wedrzaz.jpg" alt="A good CTO will ask about your business plan"></p>
<h3 id="3-the-product-is-not-your-biggest-barrier">3. The Product is Not Your Biggest Barrier</h3>
<p>If you had true market validation, investors would pour money into your startup and you could hire
the best tech talent in the world. Unfortunately, a lot of <a href="http://humbledmba.com/please-please-please-stop-asking-how-to-find">non-technical founders think they must have a working app</a> in order to validate their idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can’t sell [your idea] without an MVP, what makes you think you can sell it with one? Honestly, the difference is smaller than you’d think.” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshsymonds/">Josh Symonds</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get creative: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/creating-a-tech-startup-without-a-developer">build the MVP yourself</a>, sell a prototype, build a huge email list of interested buyers, or hire a contractor to build your first version.</p>
<p>I joined The Graide Network because the two non-technical founders had built a business generating real revenue off email and spreadsheets. Hustle in the face of not having a product is extremely attractive.</p>
<h3 id="4-technical-talent-is-in-high-demand">4. Technical Talent is in High Demand</h3>
<p>Most software engineers with more than 5 years of experience have little trouble finding a job. The trick here is to narrow your market so that your startup can stand out.</p>
<p>Limit your search to engineers who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know and trust you personally,</li>
<li>Have founded or been part of a startup before,</li>
<li>Done open source projects in your problem space, or</li>
<li>Work in the industry you’re interested in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most co-founders <a href="https://blog.close.com/the-secret-to-successful-and-lasting-co-founder-relationships/">knew each other long before they started a company together</a>, so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a random person on the internet who shares your vision. Limit your efforts on people who meet specific interest areas and you’re more likely to at least start a conversation.</p>
<h3 id="5-play-the-long-game">5. Play the Long Game</h3>
<p>Once you start having meetings, don’t lead with, “So, do you want to build my startup?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do ‘this thing’ for equity because you love it” usually means “because <em>I</em> love it” - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/griffincaprio/">Griffin Caprio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Start small, ask their advice, get to know them. Ask for introductions, mention that you’re keeping an eye out for a technical co-founder, but remember, your business shouldn’t depend on it. Tell them about the success you’re having, the challenges your facing, and see what gets them excited.</p>
<p>End every meeting asking if there are other engineers you could talk to who might know about your startup’s problem space.</p>
<h3 id="6-put-skin-in-the-game">6. Put Skin in the Game</h3>
<p>By taking a job with a startup, an engineer is forgoing most of their guaranteed salary in exchange for a piece of a fledgling company. <strong>Level the playing field by putting your money into the business.</strong></p>
<p>$50,000 might not pay a full-time engineer’s salary in many places in the United States, but it might be enough to attract a CTO to moonlight for you. If you can’t get that kind of money together, make pre-sales, borrow money, or raise money. You’re unlikely to find a technical co-founder who will work for free from day one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIkXBf3.jpg" alt="Put skin in the game"></p>
<h3 id="7-success-attracts-talent">7. Success Attracts Talent</h3>
<p>Finally, <strong>keep moving forward</strong>.</p>
<p>Never use your lack of technical skill as a reason not to move your startup forward. The longer you stick with it, the more you’ll learn, and the more likely you are to find a level of success that becomes attractive to a technical co-founder.</p>
<p>Whether you measure your startup’s success by fundraising, revenue, or users, find a way to move your key metrics forward until your future CTO can’t ignore you.</p>

		<span>Thingamagig is a Raspberry Pi-based, voice-controllable, IoT multi-effects processor and jam-along automation hub for electric guitar. I began building it in July 2019 and it’s now available for purchase on Amazon as of a couple of weeks ago.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>As </span><span><a href="https://thingamagig.com/story.html">you may recall</a></span><span>, this entire project began from a desire to add extreme automation to the at-home guitar playing experience - the ability to quickly and easily play famous covers without all the friction of amps, pedals, knobs, switches and presets.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>What’s the main innovation? </span><span>Thingamagig knows the musical composition itself.</span><span>&nbsp;Thus, during playback, it can manipulate and automate:</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>tones, crafted by a studio engineer and loaded from a central repository</span></li>
		<li><span>effects and loopers</span></li>
		<li><span>tempo, key and mix</span></li>
		<li><span>lyrics/chords (scrolling on screen in perfect time)</span></li>
		<li><span>external MI (guitars, vocal effects, etc)</span></li>
		<li><span>and especially </span><span><a href="https://youtu.be/OEPoqMXZWQI">coordinated lighting as seen in this prototype video</a></span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span>While </span><span>the last two bullets didn't make the MVP cut due to cost and complexity, the first 4 did, and combined with an Alexa interface (instant song call-up and guitarists’ hands are usually busy), I’m proud of the result. I love to play it and believe other people will, too. </span>

<![CDATA[Raft does not Guarantee Liveness in the face of Network Faults]]>

December 14, 2020 | https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Last month, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world/">Cloudflare published a postmortem</a> of a recent 6-hour outage caused by a partial switch failure which left <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> unavailable as it was unable to establish a stable leader. This outage has understandably led to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1332711011451867139">discussion online</a> about exactly what liveness guarantees are provided by the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus algorithm in the face of network failures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">original Raft paper</a> makes the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Consensus algorithms] are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement implies that consensus algorithms such as Raft should tolerate network failures (also known as <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/">omission faults</a>) as long as they do not impact communication between the majority of servers.
In this post, we will consider whether Raft can guarantee liveness, and specifically whether it can establish a stable leader, if a network fault means that some servers are no longer connected to each other.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-guarantee-liveness-in-the-presence-of-network-failures">Does Raft guarantee liveness in the presence of network failures?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Raft, as described in the original paper, does not guarantee liveness in all such cases. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is only connected to server 2 and server 5 is only connected to server 3. Initially, server 3 is the leader. Server 4 is not connected to the leader so it will timeout, increment its term and send a RequestVote RPC to server 2. Server 2 will update its term and then force server 3 to do the same and thus step down. Eventually, a new leader will be elected (either server 1, 2, or 3) but either server 4 or server 5 (or both) will not be connected to the leader and thus will timeout, updating its term and forcing the leader to step down. This system will not be able to establish a stable leader.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%201.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>Partially connected servers 4 and 5 constantly interrupt the elected leader.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to guarantee liveness, Raft must ensure that if a leader is up and connected to a majority of responding servers then it will not be forced to step down. Fortunately, section 9.6 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Diego Ongaro’s thesis</a> suggests how this can be achieved using <strong>PreVote</strong>. PreVote requires potential candidates to run a trial election to test if they can win an election before incrementing their term and running a normal election using RequestVote. A server only pre-votes for a potential candidate during the PreVote phase if it would vote for it during a normal election, and importantly, if it has not received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader with in the election timeout. PreVote fixes the problem have we described as servers 4 and 5 will not update their terms as they will not receive pre-votes from the majority of servers.</p>

<p>An alternative fix is to require servers to ignore RequestVote RPCs if they have received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader within the election timeout. This was suggested in section 6 in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> as mitigation for liveness issues during reconfiguration. However, we will focus on PreVote instead.</p>

<h2 id="so-does-raft-with-prevote-guarantee-liveness-then">So, does Raft with PreVote guarantee liveness then?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately not. In fact, PreVote introduces new liveness issues to Raft. Consider the following example. We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is connected only to server 2 and server 5 has failed.</p>

<p>Initially, server 4 is the leader. It was elected before its links to the other servers (except server 2) failed. Server 4 is now unable to make progress as it is not connected to a majority of servers. Servers 1 and 3 will not hear from the leader so they will timeout and begin the PreVote phase. Neither server will complete its PreVote phase as server 2 will not pre-vote for either server as it still receives regular AppendEntries from the leader (server 4). This system will not able to elect a new leader and the old leader will not be able to make progress.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%202.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>The leader, Server 4, suffers partial network faults but does not step down. Server 2 does not timeout, severs 1 and 3 will fail PreVote because of server 2.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be addressed by requiring leaders to actively step down if they do not receive AppendEntries responses from a majority of servers. This optimisation is sometimes referred to as CheckQuourm and related matters are mentioned in section 6.2 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Ongaro’s thesis</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/3866">raft discussions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-with-prevote-and-checkquorum-guarantee-liveness">Does Raft with PreVote and CheckQuorum guarantee liveness?</h2>

<p>Yes. If there is no leader, then an election (or series of elections) will occur and eventually, a server will be elected leader. To be elected leader, the server must be connected to a majority of servers as it received votes from a majority of servers in the PreVote and RequestVote phases.</p>

<p>CheckQuorum ensures that if the elected leader is no longer connected to a majority of responding servers, it will step down and allow a new leader to be elected.</p>

<p>There will always be at least one server that can win an election. This is the server (or servers) with the most up-to-date log (logs) within the subset of servers which are all online and connected to a majority of responding servers. PreVote ensures that once a leader from this set has been elected, the system will be stable as it will not be forced to step down.</p>

<p>Serverless or Kubernetes? The <em>“TL;DR”</em> answer to the question is, <em>“it depends”</em>. The longer answer is, it depends on a number of factors, which we will try to address in this article.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-just-on-premise-bare-metal-or-vm-servers">Why not just on-premise, bare-metal or VM servers?</h4>
<p>If your organisation is just running a single monolithic legacy application built by a single team, there is probably nothing wrong with bare-metal or VM’s. Many teams will invoke this rationale for keeping the Status Quo. But, unless you work for a small, single product company with just one small development team, this is likely not valid.</p>
<p>Most organisations will have more than one team, more than one piece of software that they deploy. The rationale of a single team or multiple isolated teams should therefore not dictate what makes sense for the entire organisation. If you have multiple teams or multiple applications/services, moving to either Serverless or Kubernetes will start to make sense for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardising deployment technology (lowers development cost).</li>
<li>Automating infrastructure management (lowers operational cost).</li>
<li>Shifting operational work to service providers (such as AWS, Google or Azure, further lowering operational costs &amp; risks).</li>
<li>Shifting capital expenditure to operational expenditure (pay-as-you-go vs upfront investment).</li>
<li>Improved resource utilisation by not paying for idle servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two additional considerations when shifting from “legacy” models of working. Firstly, there will be some retraining of internal staff on-the-job. Any change in technology requires up-skilling. The other side of this is recruitment should become easier: as you standardise on technologies that are widely used in the market, the pool from which you can draw skilled individuals become bigger. And it naturally follows that onboarding new employees becomes cheaper and faster.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-serverless-instead-of-kubernetes">When should we use Serverless instead of Kubernetes?</h4>
<p>We will preface our recommendation here with this:</p>
<p>We would suggest using Serverless in every use-case, which does not strictly fit the criteria of using something else. When circumstances do not push us strongly away from Serverless, as described in the Kubernetes section, we believe the benefits heavily outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>We would also state that this recommendation specifically holds true for the Amazon Web Services flavour of Serverless. While Azure and Google Cloud also have Serverless offerings as of this being written in late 2020, the AWS offering has a higher level of maturity, combined with the breadth of functionality to implement almost any kind of system imaginable.</p>
<p>We see five specific motivations making Serverless a good option:</p>
<h5 id="time-to-market-is-a-priority">Time-to-market is a priority</h5>
<p>You want to enable developers to iterate quickly and focus on putting new and improved functionality in front of users without being constrained by access to environments or infrastructure. Once past the initial learning curve, the productivity of a FaaS approach is quite impressive. Further, if you follow our <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/serverless-distributed-system-productivity/">five practices for Serverless productivity</a>, the cycle from code change to change deployed in an environment can be near instantaneous.</p>
<h5 id="you-want-to-shift-operational-effort-to-enabling-business-innovation">You want to shift operational effort to enabling business innovation</h5>
<p>Good DevOps skills are hard to come by. Serverless does not eliminate the need for it either. We still need these skills for CI/CD automation, observability, security and setting system constraints. But since we no longer need to babysit resources such as disks, servers or networks, the effort is significantly reduced. This allows us to better put to use the skills and people we already have - their efforts will be shifted from fire-fighting and operations to enabling business &amp; developer productivity.</p>
<h5 id="your-use-case-translates-well-to-being-implemented-using-faas--an-event-driven-approach">Your use-case translates well to being implemented using FaaS &amp; an event-driven approach</h5>
<p>An absolute pre-requisite is that your system can be implemented with stateless functions with an event-driven approach. Outside of a small number of use-cases, this should generally not be a problem for any modern system.</p>
<h5 id="you-prefer-operational-cost-scaling-with-use--utility-0-use--0-cost">You prefer operational cost scaling with use &amp; utility: 0 use = $0 cost</h5>
<p>Especially for startups and new products in established companies, the near 0 cost of unused Serverless code is very appealing. No need to sweat about wasting money on running infrastructure for code that may not be used, nor if there is a sudden surge in popularity.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-an-unpredictable-load-profile">Your system has an unpredictable load profile</h5>
<p>Capacity planning is difficult and either takes great effort, or devolves to guesswork. Serverless removes 90% of the need for this.</p>
<p>The elastic scaling means we primarily need to concern ourselves with the provisioned quotas of our system for the various services we use. While still technically capacity planning, and not quite the “unlimited scalability” promised by some Serverless proponents, it is very close. Some educated guesses and back-of-the-envelope calculations will ensure you have the right quotas set. This is much easier than trying to size Kubernetes clusters correctly with number of nodes, node sizing, disks etc, not to mention that you still won’t pay much at all for any excess capacity you may have provisioned.</p>
<p>With near infinite elastic scaling and close to 0 overhead cost, you can sleep easier at night.</p>
<h4 id="when-should-we-use-kubernetes-instead-of-serverless">When should we use Kubernetes instead of Serverless?</h4>
<h5 id="you-are-building-stateful-components">You are building stateful components</h5>
<p>If your system is made up of stateful components, for instance in-memory caches and other type of services that rely on some internal state, they are unsuitable to be built as Serverless functions. FaaS requires a heavy emphasis on stateless services/functions.</p>
<h5 id="you-have-long-running-tasks">You have long running tasks</h5>
<p>AWS lambda has an upper limit of 15 minutes runtime, after that a function will be terminated whether it is done or not. If you have long running batch-job type tasks, Serverless may be entirely unsuitable. Likewise, even if it is possible to break down a job into smaller parts that fit within the constraints, the data-transport cost (in time, and money) may exceed any benefit from running Serverless.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-real-time-or-low-latency-requirements">Your system has real-time or low-latency requirements</h5>
<p>You do not have control of the infrastructure, the precise resource allocation provided, or even concurrency in a Serverless model. If your system has real-time, or very low-latency requirements, non-Serverless solutions are preferable. Many are likely going to say <em>“we want low latency!"</em>, but this does not automatically mean Serverless is unsuitable. Serverless can be very fast, but, if consistent &lt;50ms response times for API’s are business critical, Serverless is not suitable. There are however very few cases in real life where &lt;50ms response times are crucial, and I’d venture a guess in many existing systems, those sort of response times are also the exception rather than the norm. As a side note, if requirements are truly real-time, this is an indicator your system may be more suited for running on bare-metal.</p>
<h5 id="for-existing-systems-which-are-not-easily-migrated-to-serverless">For existing systems, which are not easily migrated to Serverless</h5>
<p>It is often easier to “lift-and-shift” systems in their entirety by putting them in Docker containers. If a service is truly stateless, it may be possible to work around this particular issue by the use of so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)">“shims”</a>, which wrap the API’s of the libraries the existing system uses. Shims may be useful even with Greenfield Serverless projects, in order to reduce vendor lock-in and keep the target runtime flexible.</p>
<p>Existing systems that are not easily migrated, are highly likely to fit one of the previous three criteria mentioned.</p>
<h5 id="your-system-has-even-predictable--high-load-over-time">Your system has even, predictable &amp; high load over time</h5>
<p>While Serverless gives you the ability for elastic scaling and costs that scale with the utility of the system, it is not necessarily cheaper under all circumstances. If you have a high and predictably even load 24/7/365, running on Kubernetes or traditional infrastructure may actually be cheaper.</p>
<p>If we inspect the concept of “even” load, we quickly notice that this is actually rarely the case with most systems. Business applications have peaks during office hours. eCommerce might peak during busy holiday periods. Trading system loads are highly coupled to trading hours, with open and close particularly peaky. Finally, it may turn out the direct cost of Serverless is higher than Kubernetes, but this may still be offset by lower operational costs in human effort.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-vendor-lock-in">What about vendor lock-in?</h4>
<p>We have made a pretty firm recommendation on AWS Serverless, IF you decide to go Serverless. But what about vendor lock-in? Is this not a genuine concern?</p>
<p>Yes, but one that is often overblown. Firstly, as we mentioned, the lock-in can be reduced with the use of shims. Your application code should not be littered with AWS libraries. Ideally references to AWS code should be isolated behind shim/facade libraries. The availability of open source shims for many popular languages and libraries is also growing.</p>
<p>Secondly, vendor lock-in is everywhere we look in IT: If you use Java or the JVM, you are tied to the future whims of Oracle. If you use Golang, it’s Google. If you choose Kubernetes, Google, Red Hat and a few other vendors have an outsized influence. Whether you pay those vendors or not, there is a web of vendor lock-in around almost every IT decision you have ever made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given competition in the space, what you pay today is likely the most you will ever pay. With Azure, GCP and other breathing down the neck of AWS, they are in no position to indiscriminately hike prices. If they do, someone else will swoop in and eat their lunch. AWS are under more competitive pressure in 2020 than they were in 2010. It is unlikely to ease anytime soon. The pressures of commoditisation are real.</p>
<h4 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h4>
<p>As we have mentioned in a <a href="https://chaordic.io/blog/from-punch-cards-to-serverless/">previous post</a>, we believe Serverless &amp; Kubernetes will live side-by-side in the future, with the lines blurring over time.</p>
<p>Things change quickly: in 2018, AWS Serverless was not yet ready for prime-time other …</p></article></div></div>

<p><em>As companies increasingly leverage data to power digital products, drive decision making, and fuel innovation, understanding the health and reliability of these most critical assets is fundamental. For decades, organizations have relied on data catalogs to power data governance. But is that enough?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debashis1saha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Debashis Saha</em></a><em>, VP, Engineering at AppZen, formerly at eBay and Intuit, and </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrmoses" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Barr Moses</em></a><em>, CEO and Co-founder of Monte Carlo, discuss why data catalogs aren’t meeting the needs of the modern data stack, and how a new approach – data discovery – is needed to better facilitate metadata management and data reliability.</em> </p>



<p><em><strong>Interested in learning more about Monte Carlo’s approach to data catalogs and metadata management? <a aria-label="Request a demo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://marketing417822.typeform.com/to/D11gk1a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Request a demo</a>.</strong></em></p>



<p>It’s no secret: knowing where your data lives and who has access to it is fundamental to understanding its impact on your business. In fact, when it comes to building <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-like-a-product/">a successful data platform</a>, it’s critical that your data is both organized and centralized, while also easily discoverable.</p>



<p>Analogous to a physical library catalog, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data catalogs</a> serve as an inventory of metadata and give users the information necessary to evaluate data accessibility, health, and location. In our age of <a href="https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/self-service-business-intelligence-BI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-service business intelligence</a>, data catalogs have also emerged as a powerful tool for data management and data governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, for most data leaders, one of their first imperatives is to build a data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the bare minimum, a data catalog should answer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Where should I look for my data?&nbsp;</li><li>Does this data matter?&nbsp;</li><li>What does this data represent?</li><li>Is this data relevant and important?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I use this data?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Still, as data operations mature and data pipelines become increasingly complex, traditional data catalogs often fall short of meeting these requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s why some of the best data engineering teams are innovating their approach to metadata management – and what they’re doing instead:</p>



<h3>Where data catalogs fall short</h3>



<p>While data catalogs have the ability to document data, the fundamental challenge of allowing users to “discover” and glean meaningful, real-time insights about the health of your data has largely remained unsolved.</p>



<p>Data catalogs as we know them are unable to keep pace with this new reality for three primary reasons: (1) lack of automation, (2) inability to scale with the growth and diversity of your data stack, and (3) their undistributed format.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Increased need for automation</h4>



<p>Traditional data catalogs and governance methodologies typically rely on data teams to do the heavy lifting of manual data entry, holding them responsible for updating the catalog as data assets evolve. This approach is not only time-intensive, but requires significant manual toil that could otherwise be automated, freeing time up for data engineers and analysts to focus on projects that actually move the needle.</p>



<p>As a data professional, understanding the state of your data is a constant battle and speaks to the need for greater, more customized automation. Perhaps this scenario rings a bell:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before stakeholder meetings, do you often find yourself frantically pinging Slack channels to figure out what data sets feed a specific report or model you are using – and why on earth the data stopped arriving last week? To cope with this, do you and your team huddle together in a room and start whiteboarding all of the various connections upstream and downstream for a specific key report?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ll spare you the gory details, but it probably looked something like this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ph5m59aRfL8owiafVZisgcTG1f0-zrOXWZObUv243HS9i3Gb1uSXXEv9bWOmROiTV8cL2GhNivW5hk8P9SQG3v6NploRM15l7f9s5R6xfbIBxAjPvHCLteV65jQqhhOcT8aXDD0Z" alt="" width="800" height="497"><figcaption><em>Does your data lineage look like a storm of lines and arrows? That makes two (hundred) of us. Image courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this hits home, you’re not alone. Many companies that need to solve this dependency jigsaw puzzle embark on a multi-year process to manually map out all their data assets. Some are able to dedicate resources to build short-term hacks or even in-house tools that allow them to search and explore their data. Even if it gets you to the end goal, this poses a heavy burden on the data organization, costing your data engineering team time and money that could have been spent on other things, like product development or actually using the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Ability to scale as data changes</h4>



<p>Data catalogs work well when data is structured, but in 2020, that’s not always the case. As machine-generated data increases and companies invest in ML initiatives, unstructured data is becoming more and more common, accounting for <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3406806/ai-unleashes-the-power-of-unstructured-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 90 percent of all new data produced</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-data-platform-choosing-a-cloud-data-warehouse-3de66862f41c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Typically stored in data lakes</a>, unstructured data does not have a predefined model and must go through multiple transformations to be usable and useful. Unstructured data is very dynamic, with its shape, source, and meaning changing all the time as it goes through various phases of processing, including transformation, modeling, and aggregation. What we do with this unstructured data (i.e., transform, model, aggregate, and visualize it), makes it much more difficult to catalog in its “desired state.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, rather than simply <em>describing</em> the data that consumers access and use, there’s a growing need to also <em>understand</em> the data based on its intention and purpose. How a producer of data might describe an asset would be very different from how a consumer of this data understands its function, and even between one consumer of data to another there might be a vast difference in terms of understanding the meaning ascribed to the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, a data set pulled from Salesforce has a completely different meaning to a data engineer than it would to someone on the sales team. While the engineer would understand what “DW_7_V3” means, the sales team would be scratching their heads, trying to determine if said data set correlated to their “Revenue Forecasts 2021” dashboard in Salesforce. And the list goes on.</p>



<p>Static data descriptions are limited by nature. In 2021, we must accept and adapt to these new and evolving dynamics to truly understand the data.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Data is distributed; catalogs are not&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Despite the distribution of the modern data architecture (see: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-data-mesh-and-how-not-to-mesh-it-up-210710bb41e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data mesh</a>) and the move towards embracing semi-structured and unstructured data as the norm, most data catalogs still treat data like a one-dimensional entity. As data is aggregated and transformed, it flows through different elements of the data stack, making it nearly impossible to document.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png" alt="" width="623" height="482" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.png 623w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px"><figcaption><em>Traditional data catalogs manage metadata (data about your data) at the ingest state, but data is constantly changing, making it hard to understand the health of your data as it evolves in the pipeline. Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Nowadays, data tends to be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/self-describing-messages#:~:text=A%20message%20that%20contains%20data,consists%20of%20tag%2Fvalue%20pairs." target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-describing</a>, containing both the data and the metadata that describes the format and meaning of that data in a single package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since traditional data catalogs are not distributed, it’s near to impossible to use as a central source of truth about your data. This problem will only grow as data becomes more accessible to a wider variety of users, from BI analysts to operations teams, and the pipelines powering ML, operations, and analytics become increasingly complex.</p>



<p>A modern data catalog needs to federate the meaning of data across these domains. Data teams need to be able to understand how these data domains relate to each other and what aspects of the aggregate view are important. They need a centralized way to answer these distributed questions as a whole – in other words, a distributed, federated data catalog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in the right approach to building a data catalog from the outset will allow you to build a better data platform that helps your team democratize and easily explore data, allowing you to keep tabs on important data assets and harness their full potential.</p>



<h3>Data Catalog 2.0 = Data Discovery</h3>



<p>Data catalogs work well when you have rigid models, but as data pipelines grow increasingly complex and unstructured data becomes the golden standard, our understanding of this data (what it does, who uses it, how it’s used, etc.) does not reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that next generation catalogs will have the capabilities to learn, understand, and infer the data, enabling users to leverage its insights in a self-service manner. But how do we get there?&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png" alt="" width="624" height="486" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5.png 624w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image5-300x234.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px"><figcaption><em>Data discovery can replace the modern data catalog by providing distributed, real-time insights about data across different domains, all while abiding by a central set of governance standards.&nbsp;</em> Image courtesy of Barr Moses.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In addition to cataloging data, metadata and data management strategies must also incorporate data discovery, a new approach to understanding the health of your distributed data assets in real-time. Borrowing from the distributed domain-oriented architecture proposed by Zhamak Deghani and Thoughtworks’ <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>data mesh model</strong>,</a> data discovery posits that different data owners are held accountable for their data as products, as well as for facilitating communication between distributed data across different locations. Once data has been served to and transformed by a given domain, the domain data owners can leverage the data for their operational or analytic needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data discovery replaces the need for a data catalog by providing a domain-specific, dynamic understanding of your data based on how it’s being ingested, stored, aggregated, and used by a set of specific consumers. As with a data catalog, governance standards and tooling are federated across these domains (allowing for greater accessibility and interoperability), but unlike a data catalog, data discovery surfaces a real-time understanding of the data’s current state as opposed to it’s ideal or “cataloged” state.</p>



<p>Data discovery can answer these questions not just for the data’s ideal state but for the current state of the data across each domain:&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span>15 Nov 2020</span></p><p>This post is a reflection on being part of making a maturing infrastructure organization for nearly five years.</p>

<p>When I joined Production Engineering at Shopify, it was barely 30 people. We went for a team dinner around that time and I remember how my manager paid for it with his credit card because points. Now we are at &gt;200 people, and at the last pre-pandemic offsite we had a huge ballroom booked for the dinner. Clearly it wasn’t billed to an individual’s credit card.</p>

<p>Through my there years there, I’ve seen how we’ve solved scalability and growth by introducing boundaries and new levels of abstraction.</p>

<p>Now that I’m noticing this pattern at other companies too, I believe that managing layers of abstraction is the key tool to solving scalability problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-of-scaling-redis">The story of scaling Redis</h2>

<p>As the most of other Ruby on Rails shops, we’ve been running job queues on Redis with the <a href="https://github.com/resque/resque" target="_blank">Resque</a> gem (you might have also worked with Sidekiq which is Resque’s successor). Both of those libraries are built on top of Redis, a key-value database written in C that also provides primitives like List and Hash. As a database, Redis keeps those lists/queues in memory for you, and dumps them to the disk every once in a while if you have persistence enabled.</p>

<p>The way how Resque (or Sidekiq) API is designed, you can grab Redis client by calling <code>Resque.redis</code> and query that Redis directly for any other operations. This is convenient, and having hundreds of developers at Shopify at that point, it was easy for everyone to start dumping non-jobs data to Redis, thanks to the ease of access to <code>Resque.redis</code> in the Rails app.</p>

<p>The side effect of this easy-to-use API was that Redis became overloaded not only by the throughput of background jobs, but also by all arbitrary features where people have plugged <code>Resque.redis</code> to store ephemeral keys like throttles or inventory data.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #1</strong>: easy to access APIs can get harmful, especially when it’s designed for a smaller scale and misused at a larger scale.</p>

<p>We introduced separate Redis instances for all non-jobs features, and for a while <code>Resque.redis</code> was only used for jobs.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v1.png" width="474" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<p>But because <code>Resque.redis</code> didn’t go away as a public API (even though its use was verbally discouraged), a new pile of features have developed that were writing to <code>Resque.redis</code>, mostly because that was a developer habit.</p>

<p>It took us significant amount of efforts to completely remove <code>Resque.redis</code> as a public accessor (see <a href="https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/" target="_blank">shitlist driven development</a>) and move to not exposing Redis clients directly anywhere. Instead of giving Redis access directly, we provide a few Ruby classes that wrap Redis access, like <code>ActiveJob</code>, <code>Throttle</code> or <code>DisposableCounter</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson #2:</strong> it’s going to be much easier to scale a data store when the subset of operations is limited and its clients are not exposed directly to developers.</p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-connection">Proxies and connection</h2>

<p>It’s important to say that <a href="https://redis.io/topics/benchmarks#:~:text=Redis%20is%2C%20mostly%2C%20a%20single,on%20several%20cores%20if%20needed" target="_blank">Redis is single-threaded</a>, which means that it doesn’t employ more than a single CPU. Its authors recommend scaling by introducing more Redis instances running on other CPUs and making your app somehow shard the data across multiple Redis instances - or by using <a href="https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec" target="_blank">Redis Cluster</a>.</p>

<p>Also, the more client connections are open to Redis, the busier will be that single CPU. We started to notice that connection limits and CPU load were coming to be the two biggest bottlenecks in keeping the platform up.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://kirshatrov.com/2020/04/27/scaling-mysql-stack-part-4-proxy/" target="_blank">did for the rest of stores</a> like MySQL and memcached, we went with introducing a TCP proxy in front of Redis that would <a href="https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/09/27/multiplexing-mux-in-proxysql/" target="_blank">multiplex</a> client &lt;-&gt; backend connections and reduce the pressure on Redis’ CPU. It’s incredible how much  room you can buy for scalability by putting a proxy in front of Redis/MySQL/memcached.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v2.png" width="458" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<h2 id="proxies-and-scalability">Proxies and scalability</h2>

<p>Now all operations to Redis went through a proxy and every feature like jobs or throttles had its own Redis. But every Redis was still single-threaded, and once we had extra load on jobs or on throttles, that Redis would max out on CPU and some operations would get queued and time out. We had to horizontally scale Redis for each feature.</p>

<p>The beauty of having a proxy in front of a database is that you now you can make changes to the backend without having to change clients. Thanks to <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank">Envoy proxy</a>, we’ve been able to swap a single Redis behind the proxy with a pool of multiple Redis instances, and partitioning operations by a key.</p>

<p><img src="http://kirshatrov.com/assets/post-images/org-layers/v3.png" width="516" alt="VS Code devcontainer feature"></p>

<h2 id="layers-of-abstraction">Layers of abstraction</h2>

<p>We’ve had no abstractions at first and developers used to call the Redis client directly for any operations. <strong>We went away from giving the Redis client to providing primitives that work with Redis underneath.</strong></p>

<p>Later we <strong>moved away from making the application connect to Redis directly to giving them something that looks like Redis</strong>, but is actually a proxy that forwards commands to multiple Redis instances managed by infrastructure teams. That abstraction will also allow us to swap those backends on the proxy with another database like <a href="https://keydb.dev/" target="_blank">KeyDB</a> in we wanted to.</p>

<p>These two steps have abstracted Redis access from the application code and decoupled code from the infrastructure, which was the key to making something scale for both the load and the number of developers.</p>

<p>You can see the similar pattern with <a href="https://vitess.io/">Vitess</a>, which makes the client believe that it’s speaking to MySQL while it’s actually speaking to a Go service that applies certain logic and forwards those MySQL queries elsewhere. Used by YouTube, Github and Slack, Vitess is gaining its popularity as a way to horizontally scaling database access without increasing the complexity on the client.</p>

<p>I believe that the increasing amount of abstractions is the reasonable price to pay for scalability. <strong>It works the other way around too</strong>: if some parts of your stack are abstracted and some are not, those that are not abstracted will be the first to become a scalability bottleneck.</p>

<p>14 Dec 2020</p>
<p>Itâ€™s 2020. If you arenâ€™t using a password manager yet, <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">drop everything youâ€™re doing and switch to one</a>.</p>

<p>Using password managers is a <em>very</em> good idea. Up until last year, I was using Chromeâ€™s password manager, and it worked well, for the most part. However, I wanted something more dedicated, since I had started to see obvious issues with it (no concept of â€œmasterâ€� password, no special characters in password generators, no cross platform support, etc.). I searched around for password managers, and most reviews recommended options like Dashlane, 1password, Lastpass, etc. Figuring that there wouldnâ€™t be much difference between these options, I decided to give Dashlane a try. After all, everyone did say â€œyou canâ€™t go wrong with any of theseâ€�. Boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>The more I used Dashlane, the more puzzled I became at some of the design decisions the company chose to make. I ran into some bugs that are not only deal breakers, but are outright security issues. Since I had paid for a year of Dashlaneâ€™s premium subscription, I decided to give it a chance anyway. After having none of those issues go away after 11 months, I decided to just give up and switch to Bitwarden yesterday. In a couple of hours, all my issues magically went away. Here are my gripes with Dashlane:</p>

<p>One of the things that annoyed me the most with Dashlane was the â€œauto loginâ€� feature. If youâ€™re on a websiteâ€™s login page and Dashlane has only one login for that, itâ€™ll simply fill the credentials in, and then <strong><em>click the submit buttom for you</em></strong>. The first time it happened to me I was so confused I had no idea what happened. This is just straight up no-no in my books. Software should never do things for you unless you specifically configure it to do that. It should merely suggest and serve helpful suggestions, never do actions on your behalf. Not only that, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You canâ€™t click the â€œRemember meâ€� checkbox or interact with the page in any way.</li>
  <li>Some sites have a login page on their home screen, and this feature just makes you jump directly without even asking if you <em>want</em> to log in in the first place.</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s no global switch to turn off this feature. You literally have to open each password item in the Dashlane app and turn it off. Needless to say, for hundreds of passwords, this feasible at all.</li>
</ul>


<p>Dashlaneâ€™s password fill in popup would just randomly not appear sometimes, both in the extension, and on my Android device, requiring me to open the app and manually copy the password from there. Besides being annoying, this is a very serious security concern, since the only time the password fill in pop up should not appear <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/45067/211865" target="_blank">is when youâ€™re on a phishing site</a>.</p>

<p>I even got phished because of this once. Someone messaged me an invite to their Steam account, but the URL was staemcommunity.us (Notice the â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜eâ€™ flipped. Also, Steam doesnâ€™t have a .us domain, but it looked official enough for me in that moment). The page was a 1:1 replica of the steam page, and Dashlane refused to show the password popup. Rolling my eyes, I opened the dashlane app, copied my username and password and even submitted the form. Thankfully, the minute I submitted it I realized something was wrong (the page told me that my username/password combo was incorrect, which it couldnâ€™t possibly be), and I figured out I was phished, and changed my credentials quickly. This would have never happened had Dashlaneâ€™s popup been more reliable for me.</p>

<h3 id="no-desktop-app-support-for-linux">No Desktop App support for Linux</h3>
<p>I solely use <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!OS</a> for everything, including gaming. Imagine my disppointment when I found that Dashlaneâ€™s desktop app only supports Windows and Mac. Without the app, you canâ€™t use Dashlaneâ€™s VPN (why would you pay for premium then?). You also canâ€™t use features like password export.</p>

<p>To shift to Bitwarden, I literally had to download Windows 10, create a virtual machine, install the app, then use the export feature. <em>Why doesnâ€™t the web app have such a basic utility feature?</em></p>

<h3 id="no-ability-to-lock-extension-on-sleep">No ability to lock extension on sleep</h3>
<p>Whenever I lock/put my device to sleep, I want to extension to lock itself too, otherwise there really isnâ€™t any point to having a master password. Dashlane has no such feature. Anyone who can someone get in my machine also suddenly has access to all my passwords. Bitwarden, a free service, has that feature.</p>

<h3 id="broken-password-export">Broken Password Export</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Dashlane offers to export all your stored information in a JSON so you can shift to some other (read: better) password manager. However, after migrating to Bitwarden, I noticed that it wasnâ€™t working well with subdomains. My first instinct was to blame Bitwarden, but upon inspecting the JSON export of my information, I found out that Dashlane had grouped together passwords for all subdomains into the domain. For example, the passwords for <code>abc.example.com</code> and <code>pqr.example.com</code> were stored in the JSON as 2 different passwords for <code>example.com</code>. Morever, none of my â€œSecure Notesâ€� had made it in the export. Iâ€™m going to have to manually spend some time to clean up this mess.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Just use Bitwarden. Itâ€™s free, and the premium plan is 1/5th the price of Dashlane, and it is much more usable and has more features than Dashlane.</p>

<p>The price of bitcoin is headed back over $19,000 again. What will it take to push it past $20,000—more tethers? More institutional buying? Or maybe, more crypto journalists proclaiming (without evidence) that tethers are fully backed? Here’s the news: </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy wants more, more, more</h2>



<p>Michael Saylor, the new crazy god of bitcoin institutional buying, continues his bitcoin buying spree. He seems really, really confident the price of BTC will go up. </p>



<p>Saylor’s publicly traded company MicroStrategy currently owns 40,824 bitcoins—because no sense using all that excess cash for buying back a ton of stock or paying a big dividend. Better off to gamble it on crypto. </p>



<p>Now the firm is actually going into debt to buy bitcoin. After completing a $650 million bond offering, MicroStrategy plans to plow all the proceeds into buying more bitcoin. (<a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-completes-650-million-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes">Microstrategy PR</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-completes-650-million-bond-sale-to-finance-next-bitcoin-purchase">Cointelegraph</a>)</p>



<p>Citibank isn’t impressed. Analyst Tyler Radke downgraded MicroStrategy (MSTR) from neutral to sell, calling the recent rally—MSTR went up after its first few BTC buying announcements—”overextended” and a possibly “deal-breaker” for software investors. (<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/87054/citi-microstrategy-stock-downgrade-bitcoin">The Block</a>)</p>



<h2>Tether: Ain’t no stopping us now</h2>



<p>Tether is now at <a href="https://archive.is/wip/aITvG">$20 billion worth of tether</a>—that’s assets, but circulating supply is soon to follow—and there is no evidence whatsoever to conclude that there is $20 billion in real cash behind all those tethers.&nbsp;Why? Because the company has never had a formal audit. &nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5023" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/piles-of-money/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg" data-orig-size="600,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="piles-of-money" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=600" alt="" width="384" height="288" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=384 384w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/piles-of-money.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Still, last month, The Block’s Larry Cermak <a href="https://twitter.com/ahcastor/status/1338273950078398465">defended tethers</a> as being “either fully backed or very, very close,” telling folks “everything is in order now.” He based that on conversations he claimed to have had with “third-parties” who told him they had successfully redeemed several hundred million in tethers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cermak is not the only one to buy the Tether line of B.S. </p>



<p>In December 2018, after <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/crypto-mystery-clues-suggest-tether-has-the-billions-it-promised">looking at Tether bank statements</a>, Bloomberg’s Matt Leising also reported that Tether appeared to be fully backed. He was wrong.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, in the previous two months, the DOJ froze five NY bank accounts <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/05/02/the-us-government-wants-man-at-the-center-of-massive-cryptocurrency-scheme-held-without-bail/">belonging to Reginald Fowler</a>, who ran a shadow banking service for Tether/Bitfinex’s Panamanian payment processor. And in November, the NYAG, having serious concerns about Tether’s finances, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company">issued subpoenas to Bitfinex and Tether</a> asking for details on their banking. Finally, in April 2019, Tether admitted it was only <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents">74% backed</a>. And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?  </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2020/12/13/tether-is-too-big-to-fail-the-entire-crypto-industry-utterly-depends-on-it/">blog post</a>, David Gerard explains why Tether is “too big to fail.” Essentially, it’s keeping the entire BTC market afloat. If Tether were to get the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a>, the price of bitcoin is unlikely to ever recover. </p>



<p>Thus, “the purpose of the crypto industry, and all its little service sub-industries, is to generate a narrative—so as to maintain and enhance the flow of actual dollars from suckers, and keep the party going,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NYAG: Tether documents forthcoming</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, there’s been a new document filing in the NYAG Tether probe.<a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG"> </a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">letter</a> to the Supreme Court, NYAG says Bitfinex/Tether are cooperating on document production and the parties expect to finalize things “in the coming weeks.” These documents, of course, consist of everything NYAG asked for in its original November 2018 subpoena—information that will shed light on the Tether and Bitfinex’s shadowy dealings since 2015. </p>



<p>A part of me wants to get excited about this news, but another part says, wait a minute. In the past when Tether’s operators said they were going to hand documents over, they simply handed over material that was already public information. They also have a <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/">long history</a> of shenanigans, so let’s just wait and see.  </p>



<h2><strong>How to turn USDT into cash&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Jorge Stolfi, a computer scientist from Brazil, shared on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/kbf5jj/yes_here_we_are_holy_shit_weve_done_it_our_boi/gfmqa1o/">Reddit</a> a “mainstream theory” on what could be happening behind-the-scenes at Tether—specifically, how Tether’s operators could convert USDT into cash for their own personal use. Remember, this is totally unproven. It is just a theory. (The “triad,” by the way, refers to Tether CSO Phil Potter, CEO and <a href="https://archive.is/DfBMP">man of mystery</a>&nbsp;J.L. van der Velde,&nbsp;and CFO Giancarlo Devasini. They are the same operators behind sister company Bitfinex.)</p>



<p>He writes:</p>



<ol><li>The owners of Tether Inc (which I will call “the Triad”) print billions of USDT without any backing.</li><li>The Triad deposits those USDT into Bitfinex (which they own too).</li><li>The Triad uses those USDT to buy BTC and other cryptos from other Bitfinex clients, attracted by the better price.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the BTC to their private wallets.</li><li>The Triad moves all or some of those BTC to other exchanges that handle real currencies, such as USD, EUR, JPY, etc.</li><li>The Triad sells those BTC for real money.</li><li>The Triad withdraws the real money into their personal bank accounts.</li></ol>



<p>This is a theory. This is not proven. But the point is, when you have no checks and balances in place along with massive loopholes in oversight, <em>anything</em> can happen. We <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/">saw this</a> already with QuadrigaCX—the Canadian crypto exchange that went bankrupt after the founder disappeared (aka “died in India”), taking along with him hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  </p>



<h2>Coinbase loses half critical security team</h2>



<p>After NYT reporter Nathaniel Popper <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html">reported</a> about discriminatory complaints at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712">new information came out</a>. Among those who recently resigned to protest the exchange’s new internal policies, were four of the seven people on Coinbase’s critical security team—aka the “key management team.” </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>New detail on how the turmoil at Coinbase has hit the company's efforts to secure its Bitcoins.</p><p>Among the people who resigned this fall – to protest new internal policies – were 4 of the 7 people on the most critical security team, the "key management team," sources told me.</p></div>— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/1336072433091059712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The key management team is responsible for securing the cryptographic keys to Coinbase’s cold wallets, where the majority of the company’s crypto is held—somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 billion. </p>



<p>“No job is more fundamental to the company’s success,” Popper said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s security chief <a href="https://twitter.com/SecurityGuyPhil/status/1336082099376287745">shot back</a>, saying Coinbase’s security team is managed by several teams with redundancy built in. Of course, he wants us to believe everything is fine, but not everyone is convinced. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOL what "most of the key management team for Coinbase's cold wallets quit" is absolutely not a "nothingburger"</p>— Tony “Abolish (Pol)ICE” Arcieri 🦀 (@bascule) <a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1336091775367188481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>MassMutual invests in BTC</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has a new institutional investor: MassMutual. The Springfield-Mass insurance firm purchased $100 million worth of BTC for its general investment account, which totals $235 billion. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/massmutual-joins-the-bitcoin-club-with-100-million-purchase-11607626800">WSJ</a>)</p>



<p>MassMutual purchased the bitcoin through NYDIG, a New York-based fund management company, which has  $2.3 billion worth of crypto under management. MassMutual also acquired a $5 million minority equity stake in NYDIG.</p>



<p>The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days. Remember, bitcoin miners are selling their 900 newly minted bitcoin per day for $17 million, at current BTC prices. Investors will never see that money again. Bitcoin doesn’t make any real profits on its own—just investor money going in one end, out the other. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been writing JSON-REST APIs in Python for a number of years, and over that time I've found the tooling has greatly improved. To show you how you can benefit I'm going to show you how I've evolved. However, if you want to skip to the tooling I use today take a look at <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a>.</p> <p>Writing JSON-REST APIs in Python using Flask/Quart has always been pleasent. Yet communicating the API structure (routes, data, etc) to third parties and to my future self has not been. It is also difficult to guarantee that the API works as the documentation says it does. This has resulted in isses, bugs and misuse, in production I'd love to have avoided.</p> <p>I think I would have avoided these if the APIs I wrote,</p> <ul> <li>ensured that any data received or sent matched the communicated structure,</li> <li>communicated their structure using standardised documentation, specifically <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a>,</li> <li>were setup such that linting checks informed me if I made any mistakes,</li> <li>took less effort to write (whilst acheiving these aims).</li> </ul> <h2 id="initial-flask-setup">Initial Flask setup</h2> <p>This is a simple example of how I used to write a Flask APIs,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which works very nicely, but meet none of my aims. Both myself and third party user would have to read the code to understand what is sent and returned by the API.</p> <p>It also does not help to know when the wrong data has been sent. For example <code>due</code> should be a date but if it isn't the <code>create_todo</code> function will raise a <code>ValueError</code> resulting in the API returning a 500 response. It should return a 400 response so that the third party and I can tell that it is an error with the data rather than a server or programming issue.</p> <h2 id="flask-with-docstrings">Flask with docstrings</h2> <p>In an attempt to solve the documentation problem experienced with the simple Flask setup I tried the <a href="https://sphinxcontrib-httpdomain.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">sphinx autohttp extensions</a>,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    <span>"""Create a TODO task.

    .. :quickref: Create a TODO.

    :reqheader Accept: application/json
    :&lt;json string task: task description
    :&lt;json string due: todo due date
    :&gt;json int id: todo unique identifier
    :&gt;json string task: task description
    :&gt;json string due: todo due date
    :resheader Content-Type: application/json
    :status 201: post created
    """</span>
    data = request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> jsonify(todo), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which enables documentation to be created by manually specifying the data structures in the docstring.</p> <p>Whilst this helps with the documentation it has the same issues as the simpler Flask example, in that it doesn't validate the data sent to the route, nor the data returned. It also doesn't help with any linters, for example a simple typo like <code>data["duo"]</code> would only raise an error during testing, or worse in production.</p> <p>The bigger issue though, is writing the docstring documentation as it is time consuming, boring work that I (and my colleagues) would forget to do. Over time this lead to the documentation being wrong leading to distrust and lack of use.</p> <p>I eventually stopped using this technique and reverted to the simpler example as this documentation ended up actively misleading. It also became clear that the winning documentation standard was OpenAPI, rather than sphinx documentation.</p> <h2 id="aside-switch-to-quart">Aside switch to Quart</h2> <p>It was around this time in that I switched from writing APIs in Flask to writing them in <a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart">Quart</a>. The snippets onwards in this article will now assume Quart, but the only difference is the use of async/await keywords, you can remove them to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <p>I wrote Quart as I wanted to start using the <code>async</code> <code>await</code> keywords and libraries. You can remove <code>async</code>, <code>await</code> from the examples to get a Flask equivalent.</p> <h2 id="jsonschema-decorators">JSONSchema decorators</h2> <p>The data sent and received in the APIs I write is formatted as JSON. This means a <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSONSchema</a> could be used to describe the structure and used to validate that any data matches it. This allows me to write decorators that accept JSONSchemas to validate request and response data,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> functools <span>import</span> wraps
<span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> Any, Callable, Dict

<span>import</span> fastjsonschema
<span>from</span> quart <span>import</span> abort, make_response, request


<span><span>def</span> <span>validate_request</span>(<span>schema: Dict[<span>str</span>, Any]</span>) -&gt; Callable:</span>
    <span>"""This validates the request JSON.

    If there is no JSON in the body, or the JSON doesn't validate this
    will trigger a 400 response.
    """</span>
    validator = fastjsonschema.<span>compile</span>(schema)

    <span><span>def</span> <span>decorator</span>(<span>func: Callable</span>) -&gt; Callable:</span>
<span>        @wraps(func)</span>
        <span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>wrapper</span>(<span>*args: Any, **kwargs: Any</span>) -&gt; Any:</span>
            data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
            <span>try</span>:
                validator(data)
            <span>except</span> fastjsonschema.JsonSchemaException:
                abort(<span>400</span>)
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>return</span> <span>await</span> func(*args, **kwargs)

        <span>return</span> wrapper

    <span>return</span> decorator

<span><span>def</span> <span>validate_response</span>(<span>schemas: Dict[<span>int</span>, Dict[<span>str</span>, Any]]</span>) -&gt; Callable:</span>
    <span>"""This validates the response JSON.

    The schemas are keyed by status code.
    """</span>
    validators = {
        status: fastjsonschema.<span>compile</span>(schema)
        <span>for</span> status, schema <span>in</span> schemas.items()
    }

    <span><span>def</span> <span>decorator</span>(<span>func: Callable</span>) -&gt; Callable:</span>
<span>        @wraps(func)</span>
        <span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>wrapper</span>(<span>*args: Any, **kwargs: Any</span>) -&gt; Any:</span>
            result = <span>await</span> func(*args, **kwargs)
            response = <span>await</span> make_response(result)
            <span>if</span> response.status_code <span>in</span> validators:
                validators[response.status_code](<span>await</span> response.get_json())

            <span>return</span> response

        <span>return</span> wrapper

    <span>return</span> decorator
</code></pre> <p>These can then be used, for example,</p> <pre><code><span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(</span>
    {
        <span>"type"</span>: <span>"object"</span>,
        <span>"properties"</span>: {
            <span>"due"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>, <span>"format"</span>: <span>"date"</span>},
            <span>"task"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>},
        },
        <span>"required"</span>: [<span>"due"</span>, <span>"task"</span>],
        <span>"additionalProperties"</span>: <span>False</span>,
    }
)
<span>@validate_response(</span>
    {
        <span>201</span>: {
            <span>"type"</span>: <span>"object"</span>,
            <span>"properties"</span>: {
                <span>"due"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>, <span>"format"</span>: <span>"date"</span>},
                <span>"id"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"number"</span>},
                <span>"task"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"string"</span>},
            },
            <span>"required"</span>: [<span>"due"</span>, <span>"id"</span>, <span>"task"</span>],
            <span>"additionalProperties"</span>: <span>False</span>,
        },
    }
)
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>create_todo</span>():</span>
    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_id = create_todo(data[<span>"task"</span>], data[<span>"due"</span>])
    todo = {<span>"id"</span>: todo_id, <span>"task"</span>: data[<span>"task"</span>], <span>"due"</span>: data[<span>"due"</span>]}
    <span>return</span> todo, <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>The JSONSchemas can then be used as the documentation either when developing or to create an openapi specification of the API for third parties.</p> <p>This solves the validation and documentation problems, whilst ensuring that the documentation stays correct. It is however just as painful to write as the sphinx docstrings (although now it cannot be ignored). It also doesn't help linters understand what we are doing with the data.</p> <h2 id="dataclass-decorators">Dataclass decorators</h2> <p>To gain help from the linting tools the data needs to be defined in a structure they understand. Conveniently Python 3.7 shipped dataclasses which we can use to define the structure and will enable IDEs and linters to alert me of any issues. By altering the decorator to <a href="https://github.com/s-knibbs/dataclasses-jsonschema">convert</a> the dataclass to a JSONSchema allows a dataclass to be used instead,</p> <pre><code><span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>() -&gt; Todo:</span>
    data = <span>await</span> request.get_json()
    todo_data = TodoData(**data)
    todo_id = create_todo(todo_data.task, todo_data.due)
    <span>return</span> Todo(<span>id</span>=todo_id, task=todo_data.task, due=todo_data.due), <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>which is actually quite pleasant code to write and actually makes it quicker (with the IDE autocompletion) than any of the previous examples.</p> <p>I have been experimenting with the code to make the dataclass decorators work for a while, and it isn't the easiest. Thankfully I recently came across <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/dataclasses/">pydantic's dataclasses</a> which validate the arguments, and can generate schemas for documentation.</p> <h2 id="quart-schema-conclusion-">Quart-Schema (Conclusion)</h2> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart-schema">Quart-Schema</a> is a Quart extension that provides the validation decorators and auto-generated documentation. The example in this article in full is,</p> <pre><code><span>from</span> datetime <span>import</span> date

<span>from</span> pydantic.dataclasses <span>import</span> dataclass
<span>from</span> quart <span>import</span> Quart
<span>from</span> quart_schema <span>import</span> QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>TodoData</span>:</span>
    due: date
    task: <span>str</span>

<span>@dataclass</span>
<span><span>class</span> <span>Todo</span>(<span>TodoData</span>):</span>
    <span>id</span>: <span>int</span>

<span>@app.route("/todo/", methods=["POST"])</span>
<span>@validate_request(TodoData)</span>
<span>@validate_response(Todo, 201)</span>
<span>async</span> <span><span>def</span> <span>index</span>(<span>data: TodoData</span>) -&gt; Todo:</span>
    todo = <span>await</span> create_todo(data)
    <span>return</span> todo, <span>201</span>
</code></pre> <p>with the documentation available at <code>/docs</code> or <code>/openapi.json</code> for the raw form.</p> <p>I think, with Quart-Schema, that I've finally achieved all my initial aims in a form that is very clear and simple to write. This has only been possible with the async/await, type hinting, and dataclass improvements to Python made over the past few years.</p> <p>I'd quite like to know what you think of this - I'm on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pdgjones">@pdgjones</a>.</p> </div></div>]]>

    <span>December 6, 2020</span>
    <span>●</span>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    If you've ever managed any software project, you've probably asked
    yourself: how could our teams move faster? How fast are we moving today?
  </p>

  <p>
    For these kinds of questions, it's tempting to turn to metrics. After all,
    we use metrics routinely and successfully when we develop software. There's
    performance, production load, and uptime metrics. There are also metrics
    based on customer behavior, like conversion and retention. These metrics
    don't just provide visibility. More importantly, they create a feedback
    loop. We can make a change that is intended to improve something, and use
    metrics to see how much improvement there really was. Developer wisdom says
    that every software performance optimization must start with a measure,
    which makes perfect sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since metrics are so helpful, can't we apply them to software development
    speed? As better development processes should improve development output,
    maybe output metrics could measure whether processes really improved. So
    then, what metrics could we use?
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">
    <a href="#we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">We don't have any good metrics for that</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Development speed is the amount of work produced per unit of time, so we
    need to measure both output and time. Measuring time is simple, no problem
    there. What about work output? Attempts to measure it are as old as
    software itself. Through the years one thing's held true: whenever we
    decide a metric measures work output, something unintended soon follows.
    Consider the following examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Lines of code</b> - Probably the oldest one. Almost no one takes it
      seriously today. Counting code lines just makes the code bloated and the
      developers focus on the simplest task possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of commits</b> - encourages developers to break up their commits
      into many parts. Once again, the focus is on the simplest tasks and
      refactorings. Complex problems are avoided;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of tasks completed</b> - leads to tasks being split into subtasks.
      Every problem, even minor, is submitted as a task. Also adds an incentive
      to cut corners to complete tasks as fast as possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of bugs, or percentage of bugs</b> - not a metric of work output,
      but work quality. Discourages developers from making changes, and makes
      them reluctant to report bugs that they found themselves;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Man-hours or storypoints</b> - when estimates form the basis for how
      team performance is measured, it's easy to guess what comes next —
      inflated estimates;
    </li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Developers are smart. They specialize in cracking complex problems. For any
    metric you give them, they'll find the easiest way to improve on it. This
    way most likely won't correlate with work quality or desired project
    outcome. This doesn't necessarily mean that developers will game them. I'd
    say it depends on the context and how strong the incentives are. But one
    thing is certain - developers will realize that the measure of their
    productivity is disconnected from what matters. This is not only
    frustrating. It also distracts them from doing the real work.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="but-why">
    <a href="#but-why">But why?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Why do metrics work so well for software products, and not for measuring
    developer output? Is it some kind of developer conspiracy? Actually, if you
    look outside of software development, you'll find more examples where
    metrics work well, and where they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics work well:</b> manufacturing and sales. Let's take the
    manufacture and sale of cups. You can measure production output, i.e. no.
    of cups produced per unit of time, and production quality — percentage of
    cups that failed to pass quality control. On the sales side, you can
    measure sales volume and profit margin. These metrics are really helpful
    for management. For example, the goal for the manufacturing department can
    be to improve the percentage of cups that successfully pass quality control,
    while keeping unit costs low. The head of sales can aim to increase sales
    volume or improve profit margins. Improvements in these metrics are good
    for business, so we can also treat them as a measure of efficiency of
    corresponding departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics don't work:</b> measuring scientific output. Scientists
    publish their research in articles. Now science also has some metrics that
    measure work output and quality: no. of articles published, no. of
    citations, statistical significance of the results. Can we say that a
    scientist who published 10 articles has produced twice as much value as a
    scientist who published 5? Unlikely. Works differ too much in their value.
    Even without numbers, it's often hard to say which work is more valuable.
    Because "hacking" one's number of publications  and citations is a
    well-known problem in the scientific community, they're not considered
    reliable indicators of work productivity. Statistical significance has its
    own issues too -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q" target="_blank">
      p-hacking is a wide-spread problem</a>.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="two-key-criteria">
    <a href="#two-key-criteria">Two key criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    In any context, metrics that work well share two important criteria:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      They relate directly to value;
    </li>
    <li>
      These values are consistent, i.e. in countable quantities of
      interchangeable units.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at the examples above:
  </p>

  <p>
    Metrics in manufacturing and sales satisfy both criteria. In cups
    manufacturing, value is represented in cups. Since it's mass produced,
    cups are identical. In sales, value is measured in dollars. The business
    goal is to make money, so money's relationship with business value is as
    direct as possible. As one dollar is equal to any other, metrics based on
    money measure consistent values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In science, these criteria aren't satisfied. We can't find a metric that
    would measure the value of scientific results directly. We have only
    indirect metrics, like no. of articles and citations, which can be hacked.
    In any case, these metrics aren't consistent either, because all
    publications are not made of interchangeable units.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">
    <a href="#developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">Developer metrics fail both criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What do we have to measure developer output? Lines of code, no. of commits,
    no. of tasks completed, man-hours, storypoints… Considering these metrics
    against the two key criteria above, you'll find that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      None of them relate directly to value. We don't ship our customers lines
      of code, man-hours, or storypoints. They don't care how many commits we
      made or how many tasks we completed;
    </li>
    <li>
      All these measurements are inconsistent. One commit is not equal to
      another, one line of code is not as valuable as the other line, all tasks
      are also different, and man-hours and storypoints are based on estimates,
      which are by definition inaccurate.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's no surprise that none of these metrics work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.

  </h2>


  <p>
    Of course, no one today seriously talks about measuring developers' output
    in lines of code. There should be something more modern, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    The book <i>Accelerate</i> from 2018 presents research on 2000
    organizations of different sizes. The research goal was to identify which
    metrics would differentiate high performers from low. Here's what they
    found:

    </sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can see four metrics here. Let's see how these metrics relate to value,
    and whether they're consistent:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Deployment frequency</b> - I can see why it's listed here. The more
      frequently you ship to production, the more reliable the shipping process
      becomes. Productive teams tend to ship code more frequently. However,
      correlation doesn't imply causation. It's not directly related to
      customer value. People want a product that satisfies their needs, not a
      product that changes as frequently as possible. The metric is also
      inconsistent, because one change shipped to production is not equal to
      another.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Lead time</b> - the time for satisfying customer requests. This one
      relates more closely to value, because we're talking about the changes
      customers have asked for. However, it's not a metric with consistent
      units, because requests are not equal to each other. Some might be
      simple, and …</li></ul></div></div></div>

</header>

<p>Some time ago, I wrote a blog post about how <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/24/pointers-and-bytes.html">there’s more to a pointer than meets the eye</a>.
One key point I was trying to make is that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>just because two pointers point to the same address, does not mean they are equal in the sense that they can be used interchangeably.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “extra information” that distinguishes different pointers to the same address is typically called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance"><em>provenance</em></a>.
This post is another attempt to convince you that provenance is “real”, by telling a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when provenance is not considered sufficiently carefully in an optimizing compiler.
The post is self-contained; I am not assuming that you have read the first one.
There is also a larger message here about how we could prevent such issues from coming up in the future by spending more effort on the specification of compiler IRs.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<p>Below, I will show a series of three compiler transformations that each seem “intuitively justified”, but when taken together they lead to a clearly incorrect result.
I will use LLVM for these examples, but the goal is not to pick on LLVM—other compilers suffer from similar issues.
The goal is to convince you that to build a correct compiler for languages permitting unsafe pointer manipulation such as C, C++, or Rust,
we need to take IR semantics (and specifically provenance) more seriously.
I use LLVM for the examples because it is particularly easy to study with its single, extensively-documented IR that a lot of infrastructure evolved around.
Let’s get started!</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-why-irs-need-a-precise-semantics">Warm-up: Why IRs need a precise semantics</h2>

<p>As a warm-up, I will give a simple example showing that compiler IRs such as LLVM IR need a precise (and precisely documented) semantics.
If you are already familiar with the idea of treating compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, or if you are just here for the pointers and their provenance, you can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Consider the following simple (and contrived, for the sake of this example) piece of C code computing <code>n * (i+j)</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One transformation the compiler might want to do is to move the addition <code>i+j</code> out of the loop, to avoid computing the sum each time around the loop (this is called “loop-invariant code motion”<sup id="fnref:loop" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loop">1</a></sup>):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>sum_up</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>j</span><span>,</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>// optimized version</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span> <span>+</span> <span>j</span><span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
    <span>n</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, that transformation is actually incorrect.
If we imagine a caller using this function as <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, then this is a perfectly correct way to call <code>sum_up</code>: the loop is never entered, so the overflowing addition <code>INT_MAX+1</code> is never performed.
However, after the desired optimization, the program now causes a signed integer overflow, which is UB (Undefined Behavior) and thus May Never Happen!</p>

<p>One might be tempted to ignore this problem because the UB on integer overflow is a compiler-only concept; every target supported by the compiler will do the obvious thing and just produce an overflowing result.
However, there might be other compiler passes running after the optimization we are considering.
One such pass might inline <code>sum_up</code>, and another pass might notice the <code>INT_MAX+1</code> and replace it by <code>unreachable</code> since UB code is “by definition” unreachable, and another pass might then just remove all our code since it is unreachable.
Each of these passes has a good reason to exist (it can help real code become a lot faster or help prune dead code), but if we combine them all with loop-invariant code motion, the result is a disaster.</p>

<p>One way (and the only systematic way I know) to avoid such problems is to make sure that we can justify the correctness of each optimization <em>in isolation</em>.
Each optimization must be <em>correct</em> for any possible program, where <em>correct</em> means that the optimized program must only “do things” that the original program could have done as well.
(This is basically the “as-if” rule in the C standard, and is typically called “refinement” in the academic literature.)
In particular, no optimization must ever introduce UB into a UB-free program.</p>

<p>It may seem now that under this premise, it is impossible to perform the loop-invariant code motion we are considering.
But that is not the case!
So far, what we have seen is that the optimization is not <em>correct</em> when being performed on a C program.
But when LLVM performs these optimizations, it does not consider the program to be written in C—it considers the program to be written in LLVM IR, which has a different semantics than C.
Specifically, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM LangRef</a> says that signed integer overflow in LLVM IR yields a <code>poison</code> value.
It is not UB to produce <code>poison</code>, it is just UB to use <code>poison</code> in certain ways (the details of this do not matter here).
In a call to the optimized <code>sum_up(INT_MAX, 1, 0)</code>, the <code>s</code> variable introduced by loop-invariant code motion is unused, so the fact that its value is <code>poison</code> does not matter!</p>

<p>Due to this behavior of signed integer overflow, this case of loop-invariant code motion is <em>correct</em> if we consider it as an optimization on programs that are written in LLVM IR.<sup id="fnref:cheat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cheat">2</a></sup>
The “price” we pay for this is that replacing <code>INT_MAX+1</code> by <code>unreachable</code> is not <em>correct</em> in LLVM IR, since it is not UB.</p>

<p>The great thing about <em>correct</em> optimizations is that we can combine any number of them in any order (such as inlining, replacing definite UB by <code>unreachable</code>, and removing unreachable code), and we can be sure that the result obtained after all these optimizations is a correct compilation of our original program.
(In the academic lingo, we would say that “refinement is transitive”.)</p>

<p>However, to make the argument that an optimization is <em>correct</em>, the exact semantics of LLVM IR (what the behavior of all possible programs is and when they have UB) needs to be documented.
All involved optimizations need to exactly agree on what is and is not UB, to ensure that whatever code they produce will not be considered UB by a later optimization.
This is exactly what we also expect from the specification of a programming language such as C, which is why I think we should consider compiler IRs as proper programming languages in their own right, and specify them with the same diligence as we would specify “normal” languages.<sup id="fnref:ub-difference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ub-difference">3</a></sup>
Sure, no human is going to write many programs in LLVM IR, so their syntax barely matters, but clang and rustc produce LLVM IR programs all the time, and as we have seen understanding the exact rules governing the behavior of programs is crucial to ensuring that the optimizations LLVM performs do not change program behavior.</p>

<p><em>Take-away:</em> If we want to be able to justify the correctness of a compiler in a modular way, considering only one optimization at a time, we need to perform these optimizations in an IR that has a precise specification of all aspects of program behavior, including UB.
Then we can, for each optimization separately, consider the question: does the optimization ever change program behavior, and does it ever introduce UB into UB-free programs?
For a <em>correct</em> optimization, the answer to these questions is “no”.</p>

<h2 id="how-3-seemingly-correct-optimizations-can-be-incorrect-when-used-together">How 3 (seemingly) correct optimizations can be incorrect when used together</h2>

<p>With the warm-up done, we are now ready to consider some more tricky optimizations, which we will use to explore the question of how precise a language specification needs to be.
We will look at three different optimizations LLVM can perform, and I will show that they <em>cannot all be correct</em> since the first and last program we are considering actually have <em>different behavior</em>.
(More precisely: the last program has a possible behavior that was not possible for the first program.)
This is only possible if at least one optimization changed program behavior in an incorrect way, but it is actually not entirely clear which optimization is the culprit.</p>

<p>The sequence of examples is taken from <a href="https://sf.snu.ac.kr/llvmtwin/files/presentation.pdf#page=32">this talk</a> by Chung-Kil Hur; it was discovered while working on a mathematically rigorous specification of LLVM.</p>

<p>Here is the source program:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I am using C syntax here just as a convenient way to write programs in LLVM IR.</p>

<p>This program has two possible behaviors: either <code>ip</code> (the address one-past-the-end of <code>p</code>) and <code>iq</code> (the address of <code>q</code>) are different, and nothing is printed.
Or the two are equal, in which case the program will print “10” (<code>iq</code> is the result of casting <code>q</code> to an integer, so casting it back will yield the original pointer, or at least a pointer pointing to the same object / location in memory).</p>

<p>The first “optimization” we will perform is to exploit that if we enter the <code>if</code> body, we have <code>iq == ip</code>, so we can replace all <code>iq</code> by <code>ip</code>.
Subsequently the definition of <code>ip</code> is inlined:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second optimization notices that we are taking a pointer <code>p+1</code>, casting it to an integer, and casting it back, so we can remove the cast roundtrip:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>q</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The final optimization notices that <code>q</code> is never written to, so we can replace <code>q[0]</code> by its initial value <code>0</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>char</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>q</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>ip</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>uintptr_t</span> <span>iq</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uintptr_t</span><span>)</span><span>q</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>iq</span> <span>==</span> <span>ip</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>*</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span> <span>// &lt;- This line changed</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this final program is different from the first one!
Specifically, the final program will either print nothing or print “0”, while the original program <em>could never print “0”</em>.
This shows that the sequence of three optimizations we performed, as a whole, is <em>not correct</em>.</p>

      <p><strong>Depression is a mental disorder that affects more than 264 million people of all ages worldwide. Understanding its mechanisms is vital for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, Inserm and the CNRS recently conducted a study showing that an imbalance in the gut bacterial community can cause a reduction in some metabolites, resulting in depressive-like behaviors.&nbsp; These findings, which show that a healthy gut microbiota contributes to normal brain function, were published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19931-2" target="_blank"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> on December 11, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>The bacterial population in the gut, known as the gut microbiota, is the largest reservoir of bacteria in the body. Research has increasingly shown that the host and the gut microbiota are an excellent example of systems with mutually beneficial interactions. Recent observations also revealed a link between mood disorders and damage to the gut microbiota. This was demonstrated by a consortium of scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS and Inserm, who identified a correlation between the gut microbiota and the efficacy of fluoxetine, a molecule frequently used as an antidepressant. But some of the mechanisms governing depression, the leading cause of disability worldwide, remained unknown.</p>
<p>Using animal models, scientists recently discovered that a change to the gut microbiota brought about by chronic stress can lead to depressive-like behaviors, in particular by causing a reduction in lipid metabolites (small molecules resulting from metabolism) in the blood and the brain.</p>
<p>These lipid metabolites, known as endogenous cannabinoids (or endocannabinoids), coordinate a communication system in the body which is significantly hindered by the reduction in metabolites.</p>

<p><em><span>© Pascal Marseaud</span></em></p>
<p>Endocannabinoids bind to receptors that are also the main target of THC, the most widely known active component of cannabis. The scientists discovered that an absence of endocannabinoids in the hippocampus, a key brain region involved in the formation of memories and emotions, resulted in depressive-like behaviors.</p>
<p>The scientists obtained these results by studying the microbiotas of healthy animals and animals with mood disorders. As Pierre-Marie Lledo, Head of the Perception and Memory Unit at the Institut Pasteur (CNRS/Institut Pasteur) and joint last author of the study, explains: "<em>Surprisingly, simply transferring the microbiota from an animal with mood disorders to an animal in good health was enough to bring about biochemical changes and confer depressive-like behaviors in the latter.</em>"</p>
<p>The scientists identified some bacterial species that are significantly reduced in animals with mood disorders. They then demonstrated that an oral treatment with the same bacteria restored normal levels of lipid derivatives, thereby alleviating the depressive-like behaviors. These bacteria could therefore serve as an antidepressant. Such treatments are known as "psychobiotics."</p>
<p>"<em>This discovery shows the role played by the gut microbiota in normal brain function</em>," continues Gérard Eberl, Head of the Microenvironment and Immunity Unit (Institut Pasteur/Inserm) and joint last author of the study. If there is an imbalance in the gut bacterial community, some lipids that are vital for brain function disappear, encouraging the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. In this particular case, the use of specific bacteria could be a promising method for restoring a healthy microbiota and treating mood disorders more effectively.<br>&nbsp;</p>

				<h2 id="i">I</h2><p>In this small addendum to my essay <em><a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">The Story of COVID-19 in Sweden</a>,</em> we want to look at a very surprising statistic: the number of annual deaths in Sweden.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png" alt="" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.13.38.png 1402w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/"><em>Number of deaths in Sweden from 2010 to 2020</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>You can find the original excel file published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Sweden">SCB</a>—the official government agency for statistics in Sweden—<a href="https://www.scb.se/en/About-us/news-and-press-releases/statistics-sweden-to-publish-preliminary-statistics-on-deaths-in-sweden/">here</a>. The most striking aspect of these figures is, of course, the fact that there were no more deaths in Sweden this year than in any other year. (The year is not over yet, but it is almost impossible that the number of deaths will increase so much that 2020 will be a year with significantly more deaths.) And remember, Sweden did not have lockdowns nor mandatory mask laws.</p><h2 id="ii">II</h2><p>I got the idea to look at the Sweden’s annual deaths statistic because a friend of mine showed me the <a href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Querschnitt/Corona/_Grafik/_Interaktiv/woechentliche-sterbefallzahlen-jahre.html?nn=209016">same statistic for Germany</a>. In Germany, as in Sweden, the number of deaths this year is not higher than in other years, but for Germany, this fact could <em>theoretically</em> be explained by lockdowns and masks. Not so for Sweden.</p><p>Someone I showed these figures to suggested that although masks were not mandatory in Sweden, perhaps everyone wore them anyway. To me, this idea immediately sounded ridiculous, and it looks like I was right.</p><p><a href="http://www.coviddatahub.com/">A survey</a> asking participants whether they wore face masks in the last seven days to protect themselves from COVID-19 found that, for example, at the end of April, in the middle of the first COVID-19 wave, 82% of Swedes never wore a face mask. This is in stark contrast to, say, Germany, where only 8% did not wear a mask.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3034b31e-bf36-4d94-a52e-c9532b9465dc/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_00.26.08.png 1440w"></figure><p>The latest survey—November 9. - 15.—tells the same story.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/668bfaf9-ce60-4785-85e8-88f20cad8fa1/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_12.25.54.png 1428w"></figure><p>If you look at this statistic throughout the year, you will see that in Sweden, almost nobody wore face masks, while in Germany, almost everyone did. So what is going on here? How can they not wear masks without a high number of annual deaths? Where are those <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">7,500 COVID-19 deaths</a>?</p><h2 id="iii">III</h2><p>To get a better picture of what happened in Sweden, we need to look at the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/">weekly number of deaths</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" alt="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3af0303f-5d7a-4975-8ac0-2900d83b954b/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png" srcset="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 600w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1000w, https://limitlesscuriosity.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_2020-12-14_at_13.23.47.png 1342w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/"><em>Average daily number of deaths per week in Sweden in 2020, compared to the average daily number of deaths per week from 2015 to 2019</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see here, the first half of 2020 was an exceptionally deadly year. After that, and especially now, Sweden compares favorably with other years.</p><p>My explanation for this is simple: most people who would normally have died in the winter from viruses and diseases—especially the flu—died in the spring from COVID-19. This can happen because the groups at risk from these viruses appear to be similar. However, for my explanation to be true, (1) the number of influenza deaths in Sweden would have to be lower than in other years, and (2) COVID-19 would have to have a case-fatality rate (CFR) that is in the ballpark of influenza.</p><p>Requirement number one fits the data from other countries like the U.S., where flu deaths have dropped by two-thirds, as this New York Post article titled <em><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/24/drop-in-flu-deaths-may-indicate-that-most-at-risk-died-from-covid-19/">Drop in flu deaths may indicate that most at risk died from COVID-19</a></em> states:</p><blockquote>Flu deaths are down two-thirds from the five-year average, a drop that could indicate the most vulnerable Americans died in the first wave of COVID-19.</blockquote><p>If anyone can find good data on the number of deaths from influenza and other diseases for 2020 in Sweden, I would greatly appreciate a comment or Twitter DM.</p><p>Condition number two—the low CFR—is something I discussed in my other <a href="https://limitlesscuriosity.com/the-story-of-covid-19-in-sweden/">essay</a>. It is still not clear how deadly COVID-19 really is, but estimates are getting lower every time new data comes in, so I do not think this is unlikely.</p><h2 id="iv">IV</h2><p>Whatever the explanation for the low number of annual deaths, it seems that Sweden has done “fine” without lockdowns and masks. Something I think few people would have expected, given how things are portrayed in the media—but that's a different essay. If you have another, perhaps better, explanation for these figures, feel free to suggest it in the comments.</p><p>And as always, thank you for reading my essay.</p>

            <p>The Program audio series is a fiction podcast I write, direct, edit, and produce. Fans have described it as “love child of Black Mirror and NPR”. It’s made on zero budget and has so far received over 130,000 downloads.</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/1.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I described how The Program came to be and how it launched in <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results/">my first blog post</a> back in April, so if you’re an aspiring podcaster make sure you check out the first instalment as well. We’re picking up where that article left off - and just like last time, mistakes made &amp; lessons learned are in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

            <h3>US store feature</h3>

            <p>Hands down, the most important promotional vehicle for The Program so far has been Apple Podcasts. In the first 6 months since The Program’s release, they featured the show in 5 countries - Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand, and the UK &amp; Ireland. Then in June I finally obtained the jewel in the crown - no, not India, but a spotlight in Apple Podcasts US. Noticing that The Program hadn’t been included in their newly established “Immersive Fiction” category, I notified Apple’s partner for Canada of the travesty. With tensions between the US and Canada already running high because of the steel tariffs, the matter was brought directly to Trudeau and Trump, and a compromise was soon reached: The Program will be listed as the number 1 show in “Immersive Fiction”, and Canada will concede their security council seat at the UN.</p>

            <p>Having been featured for almost 6 months now, I’m quite confident that at least half of my daily downloads is attributable to the giant from Cupertino. Spotify however remains elusive, so if anybody reading this can lend a good word please <a href="mailto:ims@programaudioseries.com">contact me</a> and help avert another international crisis.</p>

            <h3>Change of hosting</h3>

            <p>Earlier this year, my hosting provider <a href="https://www.whooshkaa.com/">Wooshkaa</a> changed their strategy and decided to cater to established podcasting partners - which makes sense seeing that they provide power features such as IAB certification. However, for me this meant my hosting charges would go from zero to $100 per month, which just didn’t make sense seeing that The Program’s still a money-losing operation (turns out audio drama is not the most lucrative of fields - if this were a Medium post, it’d be the highlighted section).</p>

            <p>So I switched to <a href="https://redcircle.com/">RedCircle</a>, <strong>a podcast host that’s not only free, but also boasts cool extra features</strong> such as built-in capability to accept listener donations, cross-promotion with other shows, and dynamically inserted ads - a feature I haven’t taken advantage of yet, but which brings us to a topic that seems to be quite popular.</p>

            <h3>Monetization</h3>

            <p>More than one person has asked me why I haven’t mentioned the monetary aspect in my first article (two - it was two persons). The answer is simple: back then there was no monetary aspect to talk about. At the time, the only way to support the show was to chip in a few bucks at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/">buymeacoffee.com</a> - a service which seemed like an affable alternative to Patreon. However, as the builders of our civilization remarked, nomen est omen - while I was able to get a bit recurring revenue on buymeacoffee, most people treated it as a tip jar. Which is perfectly fine, since my motivation for making The Program was and is deeply intrinsic. I was becoming aware however, that in order for the show to grow I had to start generating at least some income from it - if only to compensate my collaborators who contribute their time and energy into the endeavour.</p>

            <p>So at the end of September I introduced <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/support/">five more ways to give to the show</a> with the promise of bonus material to supporters (one mini-episode and two alternative endings that were previously available to everybody). Here are the results:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/Program/">Liberapay</a>: crickets</li>
                <li>Bitcoin: 1 donation sent from a friend to test the wallet</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/programaudioseries">Paypal</a>: 2 donations</li>
                <li>Interac: 3 donations</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/programaudioseries">Patreon</a>: 29 patrons pledging $125 per month</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which goes to show that <strong>Patreon is king</strong>. Which stupefies me, because for the life of me I don’t see what’s so special about it - as far as I can tell, people don’t use Patreon to find new content, meaning the service itself is not bringing me subscribers. Sure, I guess it’s true Patreon was the first site that successfully attracted people with disposable income and persuaded them to financially support content creators. But to now take a 20% cut in perpetuity (which is how much payment, platform, and payout fees deduct) seems like pure rent-seeking to me. This, combined with the fact that all these platforms are accountable only to themselves, is why I’m strategically building a relationship with my patrons exclusively through email, which is how I dispense bonus content (until a Silicon Valley company inevitably figures out how to insert themselves between people’s emails in order to extract profit).</p>

            <p>One more way I tried to raise money for the show was by selling merch. I initially looked at <a href="http://teepublic.com/">Teepublic</a> for this, but ultimately opted for the <strong>combination of <a href="http://printful.com/">Printful</a> integrated with <a href="https://launchcart.com/">LaunchCart</a>, as it offered more customization and the ability to set my own profit margins</strong>. The result is The Program’s <a href="https://store.programaudioseries.com/">official store</a>, where I sold a whopping 4 items. However, I do feel like I’ve got myself to blame for that, as I don’t think I’ve done my best to create compelling products, and I plan to give it another go later on - but I’m definitely <strong>putting merch on hold until my audience grows much bigger</strong>.</p>

            <p>While I still haven’t inserted ads into the show (and at this point have no plans to), I was able to attract the show’s first sponsor: a lovely lad by the name of Boris and his company <a href="https://atlasauthority.com/">Atlas Authority</a> reached out and bought the show the recording equipment, allowing us to own the means of production and bringing the global class struggle one step closer to its end. Boris shrewdly realized that investing in the show now - while probably not making most sense from the strict numbers perspective - assures that his message will be heard in the years to come with exactly the kind of audience his Atlassian consulting company wants to attract. And if The Program crashes and burns, hey, at least they supported something that brings joy to people, versus giving money to Mark Zuckerberg. Speak of the devil...</p>

            <h3>Social media</h3>

            <p>Early on I made the decision not to promote The Program on any properties owned by Facebook, which probably hurts the show, but helps me live with myself. The two networks I am active on are Twitter and Reddit.</p>

            <p>The two couldn’t be more different. From my experience, Twitter is where the rich and the famous pontificate to the masses and no real communication takes place. Despite making original content for over a year now, I had little success either getting new listeners or building any sense of a community. I still post there but mostly because I enjoy making <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProgramAS/status/1274740157854466049">illustrated quotes</a> from the show and I don’t know where else to publish these. But my point stands that <strong>I do not recommend spending time on Twitter if your goal is to organically promote an audio drama</strong>.</p>

            <p>Being a part of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programaudioseries/">reddit</a> on the other hand has been nothing but pleasure. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgramAudioSeries/">The Program’s subreddit</a> facilitated some great discussions, allowed me to get valuable feedback, and most definitely promoted the show to new audiences. Especially valuable was the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/">r/audiodrama</a>, adeptly moderated by Hitch42, which is shaping into <strong>a must place to promote any audio fiction</strong>. I also gained quite a number of downloads from a post I was allowed to publish in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/">r/blackmirror</a> that compared the two shows (still waiting for someone to call Black Mirror “The Program you watch instead of listening to”).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/3.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>I definitely shouldn’t forget to mention HackerNews crowd again, not only for being so kind to repeatedly upvote and promote The Program’s threads, but also for being a wonderful resource and a constant source of inspiration (incidentally, it also has an absolutely masterful moderator going under the moniker dang, offering further proof that mods are the secret ingredient to successful online communities).</p>

            <h3>Contributors</h3>

            <p>During the course of the year, my collaboration with <a href="http://christienledroit.ca/">Christien Ledroit</a>, a super talented musician (and incidentally a neighbour), grew ever more fruitful. Chris so far supplied music for five episodes, three of which he fully scored - in some cases actually facilitating the episode to transpire (for example, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://programaudioseries.com/14-more-parrot-than-predator/">More parrot than predator</a> were it not for Chris who created the soundscape that comes alive in synch with the A.I. from the story). Chris is currently scoring three more episodes in various stages of production, so expect to hear many more of his fine works.</p>

            <p>The music that isn’t made specifically for the show mostly comes from <a href="https://www.neosounds.com/">Neosounds</a>, a royalty-free website I can <strong>absolutely recommend for the quality of their tunes and ease of use</strong>, and also because they have been generous enough to kindly extend the discount they provided to this poor producer (cost of music is the main reason the show is still not profitable even with the supporters and owning the equipment).</p>

            <p>On the visual side of things, the show’s artist <a href="https://en.cdacosta.art/">Carlos Costa</a> continues to amaze with his official illustrations, depicting three more episodes and creating new show art (which you can see at the top of the page).</p>

            <p>
                <img alt="" src="https://programaudioseries.com/the-program-results-2/images/4.jpg">
            </p>

            <p>While mentioning contributors, I would be remiss to not mention all the wonderful actors who have literally given The Program a voice. A lot of them became frequent collaborators and you can find out more about them not only in the show’s credits available at this website, …</p></div></div>

                    <p><a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/"><strong>S</strong>olarWinds</a>' credentials exposure from 2019 gives an important clue to how the breach at FireEye and US government possibly took place. It sheds light over a very important aspect that organizations often ignore – their insecure practices and inefficiency in securing credentials. <a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a> has identified weak credentials in hundreds of organizations over the course of years that we tested or, engaged in pentest with, and the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> breach seems to be just another case of gross carelessness and weak credentials. Although not confirmed by official sources, this is what we can conjecture for now. This reveals a very important piece of the puzzle, that is &nbsp;the attack was possibly not as sophisticated as it was reported to be.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">official blog post published yesterday</a>, FireEye said a "<em>highly evasive attacker </em>by <em>leveraging SolarWinds Supply Chain to Compromise Multiple Global Victims with SUNBURST Backdoor". </em>The original blog post from FireEye has been linked below</p><figure><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html"><div><p>Highly Evasive Attacker Leverages SolarWinds Supply Chain to CompromiseMultiple Global Victims With SUNBURST Backdoor</p><p>We have discovered a global intrusion campaign, and we are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452.</p><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/brand/logos/fireeye.ico"><span>FireEye</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/fw/images/fireeye-2-color-square.png"></p></a><figcaption>FireEye article about the SolarWind breach</figcaption></figure><p><strong>H</strong>owever, a recent tweet from a <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">cybersecurity researcher</a> hints at the fact this compromise probably dates back to 2019, that is more than an year before the <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a> and US government breach were reported, and the attacker might have been able to own their servers through very simple techniques. Password spraying is a very common technique employed by malicious attackers to compromise systems. In the case of SolarWinds this was even simpler, and weaker credentials may have made the hacker's job just more easier.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-exposed-their-ftp-credentials-in-a-public-github-repository">SolarWinds Exposed their FTP credentials in a public GitHub Repository</h2><p> <strong>Cybersecurity expert, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/">Vinoth Kumar</a> hinted at the fact that the perpetrator may have breached SolarWinds and its clients quite easily – this affects the US government, and top organizations worldwide. Kumar made the following tweet today,</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Was reading about a sophisticated attack on FireEye leveraging Solarwinds. Hmmm how that would happened?🤔. Then realized their password was *****123 🤣 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FireEye</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SolarWinds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SolarWinds</a> <a href="https://t.co/foGzEOdytG">pic.twitter.com/foGzEOdytG</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338431183588188160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>Vinoth Kumar's tweet regarding the exposed FTP credentials of SolarWinds</figcaption></figure><p>For the readers who couldn't fully understand the tweet, Vinoth had apparently gotten access to a SolarWinds FTP server on 19th November, 2019 through FTP credentials leaked in a SolarWinds public <a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> repo (apparently a<em> configuration</em> file as can be observed from the above email screenshot) which is more than one year ago. He responsibly reported this security incident to the SolarWinds PSIRT team.</p><p>The above tweet includes a screenshot of Vinoth's email communication with the SolarWinds' security team who seem to have acknowledged the issue, but its unclear whether after the incident SolarWinds hardened their server security.</p><h2 id="nation-state-adversary-or-a-simple-github-leak">Nation-State adversary or, a simple Github Leak?</h2><p>Exposing password in public GitHub repositories is a very common security lapse among organizations but can be prevented quite easily with secure practices. We have identified thousands of credentials belonging to companies and responsibly reported such cases. This happened in the case of SolarWinds too, Vinoth found their FTP server credentials which allowed read as well as write access to SolarWinds' FTP server. This critical vulnerability could have allowed them to upload malicious files and binaries to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, which made the SolarWinds Orion software available to its clients for download.</p><p>Vinoth confirmed that the FTP credentials SolarWinds leaked had write access by uploading a test file to the vulnerable FTP server – <a href="https://downloads.solarwinds.com/">downloads.solarwinds.com</a> which apparently hosts very important files, and if tampered with, the results can be disastrous, which was likely the reason of the US Government breach that happened recently. </p><h2 id="solarwinds-might-have-been-compromised-at-least-an-year-ago-in-november-2019">SolarWinds might have been compromised at least an year ago, in November 2019</h2><p>SolarWinds' PSIRT team's last reply to Vinoth was on 22nd November, 2019 which is 3 days after his report, </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the last response I got from them. <a href="https://t.co/Q24JGb3mvr">pic.twitter.com/Q24JGb3mvr</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338449660327854080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>SolarWinds Security Team's response to Vinoth Kumar acknowledging the vulnerability</figcaption></figure><p>They have informed him that the Github repository exposing the credentials was subsequently taken down by SolarWinds. This may have played an important role in the latest security breach of SolarWinds that led to the US Government breach.</p><h2 id="complex-attack-or-a-case-of-weak-credentials">Complex Attack or, a Case of Weak Credentials?</h2><p>Vinoth further mentions in the tweet that the password was <code>*****123</code>. Our <strong>guess</strong> is that, the password of that FTP server was <code>solarwinds123</code>, leaving the redacted part, which is a very weak credential. <code>solarwinds123</code> is an example of the weakest credentials one can think of. &nbsp;Credentials of the FTP download server which was exposed on the SolarWinds GitHub repo are as follows – <code>solarwindsnet:solarwinds123</code></p><p>It would take seconds for advanced credential stuffing tools to exfiltrate into SolarWinds networks leading to the supply chain of the malware used in this attack, which seems to be the case here. Weak and easy to guess credentials continue to be a very common cause of breaches that happens these days. We have observed a lot of big companies using <code>admin:admin</code> and easy to guess credentials in their internal panels, while we performed pentests and bug hunting research. </p><p>This is an ideal example to learn from, what the consequence of weak credentials can be. Organizations should learn from these breaches how easy it is for attackers to compromise an entire organization just by guessing credentials and performing password stuffing attacks.</p><p><em>Although there is more to it that led to the series of events</em>, but the exposed and weak credentials might have played a major role in the SolarWinds hack. The attackers might have been able to gain persistence by obtaining SolarWinds internal credentials and then able to backdoor the SolarWinds Orion (which FireEye called the SUNBURST backdoor, https://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp) by uploading it to the SolarWinds Downloads FTP server, and distributing the same via SolarWinds website to its clients.</p><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-expert-vinoth-kumar">Q&amp;A with Cybersecurity Expert <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">Vinoth Kumar</a></h2><p>We asked cybersecurity expert Vinoth about his opinions on this breach, and how organizations can secure themselves from such sophisticated attacks.</p><p><strong>Q: As you mentioned you found some credentials in the open, do you think the attackers went for a similar approach to use simple OSINT techniques in order to exfiltrate the data?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>I think the attackers must have used the same approach as the FTP server was open &amp; credentials were not strong enough. But it was a sophisticated attack as the binaries were signed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you think organizations can protect themselves from breaches and exposing their credentials?</strong></p><p><strong>Vinoth: </strong>Normally most of the companies includes us use the automated scanner for GitHub repos scanning to see any leaked internal credential also security credential scanning should be part of SDLC process.</p><p>Vinoth's social handles and website – <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">vinothsparrow</a> and <a href="https://vinothkumar.me/">VinothKumar.me</a></p><h2 id="notable-victims-of-the-solarwinds-breach">Notable Victims of the SolarWinds Breach</h2><p>US Treasury, the US NTIA, and possibly FireEye itself.

December 14, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GraphQL has been seeing a rapid uptick in adoption.  It enables a more expressive interface between frontend and backend code by allowing developers to specify exactly what data is required to render a given page.  While there are numerous wins for frontend engineers, the backend team needs a different mindset.  Instead of writing route handlers that return a fixed set of data (or maybe a few variations), the backend team must write <strong>resolver functions</strong> which return portions of the dataset individually. </p>
<p>We've seen that many developers will apply route-level checks as a starting point for authorization in their applications.  A common pattern is using decorators or other route level guards that ensure a user meets certain requirements (the user is an admin, the user has a certain role, etc.) before the route code is run.</p>
<p>This approach is easy to get started with, but is typically not feasible in GraphQL.  There is one route in a GraphQL application, and the potential set of data returned is highly variable.  There are many more combinations of fields in a GraphQL query than the number of routes in a typical REST application.</p>
<p>Since GraphQL is oriented around access to individual data elements, a natural place to enforce authorization is during data access.  GraphQL's official documentation acknowledges as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where should you perform validation and authorization checks? The answer: inside a dedicated business logic layer. Your business logic layer should act as the single source of truth for enforcing <em>business domain rules</em> [emphasis added].</p>

<p>Great. Easy.  But how does that actually work?  How do we enforce a business domain rule? Is there a simple abstraction for specifying them?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look at using oso—an open source authorization library—for enforcing authorization rules.  We'll see how to declaratively specify authorization rules in Polar, oso's policy language, and how to integrate oso into a GraphQL application in only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We'll use SQLAlchemy as our ORM, and Graphene — a popular Python GraphQL library.  The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/sqlalchemy.html#installation">library</a> will provide the glue between oso, GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, allowing us to enforce authorization consistency.</p>

<p>We'll start with a basic Flask app representing an expense management application.  To follow along, <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app">clone the project on GitHub</a>.  We'll walk through the parts of this app relevant to authorization, but the full code is available in the project. We'll assume some familiarity with Flask, SQLAlchemy and GraphQL.  Each section of this post is based on a commit in the repository, and we'll link to the relevant commit at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>If you plan on following along and trying out the examples as you read, make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/blob/main/README.md">README</a> to install the dependencies so you can run the code. This section covers the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/tree/922af81fc265efc82f9572e174833689f051ae9a">initial commit</a>.</p>
<p>Our app has a few models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> An expense created by a user.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> A user accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with these, and add some more later.  Here are our initial models from <code>models.py</code>. These are regular SQLAlchemy models.  We used the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/">flask_sqlalchemy</a> library to integrate with Flask and make our setup a bit easier.</p>
<pre><code>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Expense(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'expenses'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    amount = db.Column(db.Integer)

    created_by_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    created_by = relationship("User")

    description = db.Column(db.Text)

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(256))
</code></pre>

<p>An Expense is created by a user, available at the <code>Expense.created_by</code> property.</p>
<p>We also have a GraphQL schema defined using Graphene over these models in <code>app/schema.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyConnectionField, SQLAlchemyObjectType

from flask import g

from . import models

class Expense(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Expense
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class User(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    expenses = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(Expense.connection)
    user = graphene.Field(User)
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()

    def resolve_user(parent, info):
        return (g.current_user
                if isinstance(g.current_user, models.User)
                else None)

# ... snip ...

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
</code></pre>

<p>This schema uses the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphene-SQLAlchemy library</a> to create Graphene schema objects for our SQLAlchemy models.  This is a <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/#defining-our-models">standard approach</a> for using SQLAlchemy with Graphene.</p>
<p>We can make a simple query (I'm using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> tool for this, but you can also just go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/graphql">http://localhost:5000/graphql</a> in your browser) and see that our app is working:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Adding authorization</h2>
<p>At this point, we have a basic GraphQL app, without authorization.  Let's set that up. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/commit/8bf8c4a411f83e640fdd3537ddcc3d59049edecf">commit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial authorization rule will be based on the concept of data owners: <em>users can view their own expenses.</em></p>
<p>To implement this rule, we would need to perform filtering at the SQLAlchemy level. Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a custom resolver for Expense</li>
<li>Checking all other places the GraphQL schema might access expenses</li>
<li>Implementing the custom SQLAlchemy query</li>
<li>Repeating for every other model and authorization check.</li>
</ol>
<p>This authorization rule is based on each database record—sometimes referred to as object-level permissions.  It can be challenging to abstract as middleware, and is certainly more complex than just adding the simple decorator we discussed earlier. </p>
<p>Instead, we'll use the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library.  We need to make two changes to set this up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an instance of <code>Oso</code> to our application.</li>
<li>Write a policy containing our authorization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add oso, we'll modify the <code>create_app</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models

def create_app():
    # snip ...

    # Create oso instance which will hold our policy.
    oso = Oso()  
    # Make SQLAlchemy models available in the policy.
    register_models(oso, db.Model)  
    # Load policy file into oso.
    oso.load_file(Path(__file__).parent / "policy.polar")   

    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we swap out the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object in our app with <code>AuthorizedSQLAlchemy</code>. In <code>models.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from sqlalchemy_oso.flask import AuthorizedSQLAlchemy

db = AuthorizedSQLAlchemy(
    get_oso=lambda: current_app.oso,
    get_user=lambda: getattr(g, "current_user", None),
    get_action=lambda: "read"
)
</code></pre>

<p>We use this object instead of <code>flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy</code>.  It provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session.html">SQLAlchemy Session object</a> that filters queries to only return objects that are authorized for the current user and action.</p>
<p>Our policy file, <code>app/policy.polar</code> is empty for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's check our query results:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png"></p>
<p>Nothing's returned anymore.  Why? The policy file is empty.  Polar is deny by default, so we'll need to add some rules.  Before we do that, let's take a look at how this is working.  Our app has an endpoint that will log the SQL used to execute our last query.  If you're following along, run the app with:</p>
<pre><code>$ FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES=app/policy.polar FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code></pre>

<p>Run a query in GraphiQL.  Below is a good starting point.</p>
<pre><code>{
  expenses {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        description
        createdBy {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now visit, <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we see:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) AS count_1
  FROM (
        SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
               expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
               expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
               expenses.description AS expenses_description
          FROM expenses
         WHERE 0 = 1
         ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
       ) AS anon_1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice our WHERE clause: <code>0 = 1</code>.  Where's that coming from? <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> enforces our Polar policy by translating rules from the policy into SQL filters.  <code>0 = 1</code> is always false, which causes no records to be returned from the database.</p>
<h2>Adding some rules</h2>
<p>Now that we have oso integrated, let's finish implementing our authorization rule.  Keep the app running, the <code>FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES</code> environment variable we set will ensure that Flask reloads the app when you change the policy.</p>
<p>Let's try the following (in <code>app/policy.polar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>allow(_actor, _action, _resource);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy allows the user to access any object.  In Polar, each statement in the policy is called a rule.  The <code>allow</code> rule is a special rule that is used as the entrypoint to policies.  It has three arguments, the <strong>actor</strong> (who's making the request), the <strong>action</strong> (what the request will do), and the <strong>resource</strong> (what the request is operating over).  Our policy has one rule.  Each parameter starts with <code>_</code> which indicates an anonymous variable (one that matches anything because there are no constraints on it).</p>
<p>Rerun the query, and check out the SQL (Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>. You'll see a few statements there, I've picked out the primary SQL query used to resolve the GraphQL query):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
       expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
       expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
       expenses.description AS expenses_description
  FROM expenses
 WHERE 1 = 1
 ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
 LIMIT 4
OFFSET 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we see <code>WHERE 1 = 1</code>.  This is always true! As a result, everything's been returned.  </p>
<p>Let's go a little further:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "read", _: Expense);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy is saying all users can read all expenses. Again, the <code>_</code> denotes an anonymous or ignored variable, but the <code>: User</code> syntax is checking that the input data matches a specific type. In this case, the User and Expense models from our <a href="http://models.py/">models.py</a> file.</p>

<p>I was using Scrapy to crawl some websites and mirror their content into a new one and at the same time, generate beautiful and unique URLs based on the title, but the title can appear repeated! So I added part of the original URL in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36">base36</a> as uniqueness guarantees.</p>
<p>In the <em>URL</em> I wanted the title without special symbols, only ASCII and at the end a unique and short inditifier, and part of the result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a> of the URL in <em>base36</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Within privacy circles, Glenn Greenwald’s <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">2014 TED talk</a> titled “Why privacy matters” is considered required reading. One quote jumps out to nearly everyone ― including the live audience ― has to do with how Greenwald responds to people who don’t worry about privacy because they have nothing to hide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, “Here’s my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts…[snip]”</p>

  <p>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continues to explain why that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there’s a reason for that, which is that we as human beings, even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy, instinctively understand the profound importance of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending that thinking with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People can very easily in words claim that they don’t value their privacy, but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to agree and echo the same point, mostly in jest. Some version of “then hand me your passwords” is even a popular comeback <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/search?q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;restrict_sr=1">on Reddit</a> to the the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>” argument.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve come to realize that the response does very little to actually understand where people are coming from, and to really explain to them <a href="https://whyprivacymatters.org/">why privacy matters</a>. Of course no one would hand me keys to their bank account just to prove a point. I won’t dissect the matter too much ― people much more qualified than me have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=nothing+to+hide+argument&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=%22nothing+to+hide%22">doing so for years</a>.</p>

<p>One understated aspect of the “nothing to hide” argument has to do with how humans think of themselves in crowds. Much like in a busy city, people tend to think they are invisible; they are one in many. Everyone feels a sense of anonymity in large crowds. Individuals are surrounded, but not watched. They are not “important”.</p>

<p>I believe the same concept intrinsically causes an average person to suspend the need for privacy in the digital realm. I have nothing to hide, because no one is watching <em>me</em>. I am not “important”.</p>

<p>Up until the 1980s spying was very labor intensive and hard to scale. You could only spy on one person at a time. With the advent of <del>big data</del> digital data processing, falling prices of surveillance equipment, as well as dirt-cheap storage and compute technologies, that is no longer true. Through economies of scale, it is cheaper to monitor and spy on a hundred thousand people than on hundred people.</p>

<p>With the choice of privacy, we have the freedom to choose to be who we want; we are allowed to create identities we choose. The promise of the Internet and technology was to expand that choice even more. Every day, I see that promise reneged.</p>

<p>Recently, many apps including TikTok and LinkedIn were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/">caught snooping</a> on clipboards on iPhones (data you cut or copy but may not have pasted anywhere else). Weirdly, they all claimed to have had the same bug. Even with all the might of the US government or the Soviet spying apparatus, accidentally spying on tens of millions of people’s thoughts was impossible until recently. Now, all it takes is an over-worked software engineer.</p>

<p>We all are creeped out when we see a car following us. I do not believe that at this time privacy advocates are doing a good job of explaining to normal people why digital surveillance is cause for concern. I believe their arguments are scattered, hard to parse, and still considered an artifact of the cypherpunk era. We can do a better job of talking about how knowledge, privacy, and power are interconnected, and how that balance of power has tipped largely against the general public.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of explaining why the promise of a better life through technology has been a lie, and that the cost is too high.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t think we need to be extremists about our privacy. Giving up some privacy is good under some circumstances ― sharing personal details with loved ones creates a more intimate bond, sharing some details with government health departments helps in contact tracing during a pandemic.</p>

<p>As we approach Christmas 2020, many Americans are being forced to decide how they will celebrate the holiday. The <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="CDC Website" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html">CDC</a> has recommended postponing travel and staying home. It has also recommended using technology to host virtual gatherings.</p>
<p>But how likely are Americans to follow these guidelines and leverage technology to adapt to the pandemic? To find out, we surveyed 1,002 Americans. Below, we analyze the results of our two surveys, which were taken two weeks apart on November 23rd and December 7th.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Almost 30% of Americans Will Celebrate Christmas Virtually in 2020</h2>
<p>We surveyed Americans in November and December to find out how many will use software to celebrate Christmas virtually, and how many are moving forward with Christmas per usual. We found that 19.3% of Americans will celebrate Christmas all in person per usual, 43.0% will celebrate in-person, but with a smaller group, and 28.5% will celebrate virtually.</p>
<div>
<p><img alt="how Americans will celebrate Christmas 2020" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_1.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 1x, https://res.cloudinary.com/softwarepundit/image/upload/c_limit,dpr_2.0,f_auto,h_1600,q_auto,w_1600/v1/software/main-christmas-2020-chart 2x">
</p>
</div>
<p>In recent weeks, COVID-19 cases have spiked across the country. We compared our November and December surveys to understand how the increase in cases has impacted Christmas plans. Interestingly, the percentage of respondents who indicated that they would celebrate in-person per usual, and the percentage who indicated that they would celebrate virtually both increased. In contrast, the percentage who responded that they would celebrate in-person with a smaller group declined.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Americans in Blue States are 33% More Likely to Go Virtual, Red States 16% More Likely to Celebrate In Person</h2>
<p>We grouped respondent results by state to explore if a state's political orientation has an impact on Christmas plans. Respondents in states that were won by Joe Biden in the 2020 election were 33% more likely to celebrate Thanksgiving virtually (p=&lt;.01)). In addition, Americans in states that were won by Donald Trump were 16% more likely to celebrate in person (p=&lt;.01).</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Older Americans Are Less Likely to Celebrate in Person</h2>
<p>Breaking results down by age shows that the youngest Americans are most likely to celebrate Christmas in person. 73% of respondents aged 18-24 plan to celebrate Christmas in person. This contrasts with only 59% of Americans over the age of 65 who plan to celebrate in person. Only 15% of Americans over 65 plan to celebrate in person per usual, which is the lowest percentage among any age group.</p>

</p>
</div>
<h2>Females Are Far Less Likely to Celebrate Christmas In Person Per Usual</h2>
<p>Analyzing our data by gender also revealed differences in Christmas plans. Females were 88% less likely to celebrate Christmas in person per usual (p=&lt;.001). In contrast, women were more likely to indicate that they plan to celebrate in person with a smaller group. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentage of men and women who plan to celebrate in person in any size group (i.e. per usual or with a smaller group).</p>

<h2>Americans Have Become More Likely to Celebrate Holidays Virtually as COVID-19 Hospitalizations Have Increased</h2>
<p>In the past three months, we have asked Americans about their holiday celebration four times –&nbsp;twice for Christmas, and twice for <a target="blank" title="Almost 20% of Americans Will Hold Virtual Thanksgiving in 2020" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/industry-research/virtual-thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>. As shown below, the percentage of Americans who indicated that they will celebrate holidays virtually has climbed as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have increased.</p>

<h2>What Are the Most Popular Software Solutions for Virtual Christmas?</h2>
<p>Our research revealed the four most popular software tools for virtual Christmas to be Zoom, Facebook Messenger Rooms, Google Meet and Skype. Consumers trust that these popular and proven <a title="video conferencing tools" href="https://www.softwarepundit.com/mental-health/hipaa-compliant-video-conferencing">video conferencing tools</a> can be used reliably for larger groups during holidays. They are also more familiar with them compared to newer or niche video chat software.</p>
<h3>Zoom</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Zoom Website" href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> went public in late 2019, and became a household name as a result of COVID-19. It is among the most popular video conferencing software in the market today. Zoom does offer a free plan, but group meetings can only last for 40 minutes. Zoom subscriptions start at $149.90 per year.</p>
<h3>Facebook Messenger Rooms</h3>
<p>Facebook launched <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Facebook Messenger Website" href="https://www.messenger.com/rooms">Messenger Rooms</a> in April 2020. With this new feature, you can use Facebook or Messenger to create a room of up to 50 people. Other than being free, a major upside of Messenger Rooms is that there's no time limit on video calls, and you don't need a Facebook account to join.</p>
<h3>Google Meet</h3>
<p>Google offers its own free video conferencing solution, known as <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Google Meet Website" href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Meet</a>. Anyone with a Gmail account can create meetings, and invite up to 100 people to meet for up to 60 minutes for free. For $8 per month, you can increase these figures to 150 people and 300 hours.</p>
<h3>Skype</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" title="Skype Website" href="https://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> is a popular video conferencing service that has been around since 2003. The Microsoft-owned company is still highly popular. It offers an attractive free plan that allows calls of up to 50 participants for up to 24 hours. Skype now works through any device with the Skype app or in any Internet-connected browser.</p>
<h2>Research Methodology</h2>
<p>To collect data, we conducted online surveys targeting a sample of all Americans physically located in the United States. 1,002 respondents were asked the multiple choice question "How will your family gather for Christmas this year?" Available answers were "All in person per usual", "In-person with a smaller group", "Virtually using a video call", and "Other." Answers were presented in a randomized order.</p>
<p>Detailed respondent data: </p><div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>7% ages 18-24</li>
<li>13% ages 25-34</li>
<li>16% ages 35-44</li>
<li>16% ages 45-54</li>
<li>17% ages 55-64</li>

A strong sense of ownership means that the individual deeply cares about and feels responsible for doing a good job for their customers, their team or their company. Owners don't assume someone else is there to catch the ball, they go for it. That is their default behavior. </p><p>Ownership clearly applies to almost every aspect of our lives, but here I'm mainly talking about it from an engineering manager's point of view. Managers are accountable for the reliability of systems that their teams own. A Manager cannot instill a great sense of ownership into their team members without feeling responsible and being accountable for the end-to-end experience of their customers.</p><p>Usually it is not difficult to figure out whether an individual, a team, or an organization has a strong sense of ownership: </p><ul><li>Does the individual, team or organization follow up on their commitments? Is communicating how they did with their commitments a part of their sprint or quarterly planning? </li><li>Does the individual, team or organization care about bugs, system outages or other issues that cause production unreliability? It is important to clarify that this does not mean there are no bugs, or issues that cause system unreliability. It means that the team is resolving these issues quickly, or making big investments in reliability that may take a long time to roll out. Does the team understand the problems causing unreliability and have both a short and long term plan to mitigate these problems?</li><li>Your customers usually don't know the underlying technology, or the services and components created by different teams in your company, and they don't care. Does the individual, team or organization take full ownership of the end-to-end customer experience or do they assume another person or team is responsible for this?</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-13.png 1000w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/image-13.png 1600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-13.png 1724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ownership requires making tough choices</figcaption></figure><h3 id="ownership-requires-making-tough-choices">Ownership Requires Making Tough Choices</h3><p>One thing to keep in mind about taking ownership is that it also requires you to make tough choices. These tough choices might not be received well by some colleagues and some customers. They might entail throwing away a functionality that one of your team members worked hard on. </p><p>Adding a new feature is usually much easier than taking it away from your customers. Giving new data is almost always much simpler than taking away data. Ownership means thinking hard and understanding your whys when adding new features but sometimes it also means making the decision to remove a service when you know you should not have implemented it in the first place. </p><h3 id="an-accountable-manager">An Accountable Manager</h3><p>A team with a great sense of ownership requires an accountable manager. An accountable manager must instill this sense of ownership into his/her team members because they cannot sustain it long term on their own. Managers need to encourage and reward team members who: </p><ul><li>Care deeply about their customers' experience</li><li>Ask clarifying questions when there are ambiguities</li><li>Push back on implementing something without fully understanding use-cases or value</li><li>Push back on implementing something that is unsustainable </li><li>Follow up on their commitments (even if they decide they can't do them)</li><li>Prioritize fixing bugs</li><li>Do not assume that someone else will take care of things</li><li>Do not blame others for mistakes, and instead ask how they can prevent the same mistakes going forward. </li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-12.png" alt="ownership requires making tough choices" srcset="https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-12.png 1000w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/image-12.png 1600w, https://blog.managers.app/content/images/2020/12/image-12.png 1648w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>the importance of ownership</figcaption></figure><p>A sense of ownership is a state of mind that requires constant care by the whole team.

                <h2 id="dsla-x-elrond">DSLA x Elrond</h2>

<p>Dear community, <a href="https://stacktical.com/">Stacktical</a>, the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have partnered with the <a href="https://elrond.com/">Elrond</a> network to launch DSLA Maxima “Elrond Edition”, a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Elrond blockchain.</p>

<p>The first DSLA product helps validators and delegators on Proof of Stake networks reduce their mutual exposure to staking infrastructure risks, using decentralized service level agreements and two-way, self-settled compensation claims.</p>

<p>Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding Elrond Network validators information in the DSLA Ethereum-based smart contracts. Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Elrond Network, serving the same purpose but at higher speeds and lower costs, hence the “Maxima” codename.</p>

<p>In the long term, the DSLA core development team will leverage Elrond’s high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution platform to deploy a decentralized SLA framework suitable for digital services of any kind.</p>

<p>“Elrond has one of the largest validator networks in the PoS space and is a great addition to DSLA Protocol, and our flagship two-way hedge against staking and delegation risks. But the biggest value for us long term is its high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution capabilities, which we can leverage to settle SLAs in real-time, at internet-scale, for a wide variety of industries.” said Wilhem Pujar, Stacktical CEO.</p>

<p>The collaboration will bring additional adoption for the Elrond smart contract platform and provide an immediately useful tool for Staking Providers looking to increase the quality of their services.</p>

<p>“Today’s unexpected Google outage will likely cause tens of millions of dollars in losses to businesses worldwide. Automatically settling SLA breaches will increase the quality of online services and help avoid such situations. We’re happy to support this through our collaboration with Stacktical” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="about-elrond">About Elrond</h2>

<p>Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.</p>

<hr>
<p>In this blog post, we look at <em>polymorphic variants</em>, which are a more flexible version of <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">normal variants</a>. But that flexibility also makes them more complicated.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>[Aside: this blog post was challenging to write and is based various resources on the web. Corrections and tips welcome!]</p>
<h2 id="what-are-polymorphic-variants%3F">What are polymorphic variants?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Polymorphic variants are similar to normal variants. The biggest difference is that constructors are not tied to types anymore; they exist independently. That makes polymorphic variants more versatile and leads to interesting consequences for the type system. Some of those consequences are negatives – they are the price you pay for the versatility.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the following normal variant and then turn it into a polymorphic variant.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = Red <span>| <span>Green</span> | <span>Blue</span>;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The polymorphic version of <code>rgb</code> is defined like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The constructors of a polymorphic variant must be wrapped in square brackets and their names must start with backticks followed by either lowercase letters or uppercase letters:</p>
<pre><code># `red;
- : [&gt; `red ] = `red
# `Red;
- : [&gt; `Red ] = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>As usual, types such as <code>rgb</code> must start with lowercase letters.</p>
<h3 id="polymorphic-constructors-exist-on-their-own">Polymorphic constructors exist on their own&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can only use a non-polymorphic constructor if it is part of a non-polymorphic variant:</p>
<pre><code># Int(123);
Error: Unbound constructor Int

# type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
type data = Int(int) | Str(string);
# Int(123);
- : data = Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, you can just use polymorphic constructors. There is no need to define them beforehand:</p>
<pre><code># `Int(123);
- : [&gt; `Int(int) ] = `Int(123)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>`Int(123)</code> has an interesting type: <code>[&gt; `Int(int) ]</code>. We’ll examine what that means later.</p>
<p>Polymorphic constructors existing on their own, enables using the same constructor more than once:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> color = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, with normal variants, you should avoid multiple variants within the same scope having the same constructor.</p>
<p>You can even use the same polymorphic constructor with different arities and/or type parameters:</p>
<pre><code># `Int("abc", true);
- : [&gt; `Int((string, bool)) ] = `Int(("abc", true))
# `Int(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
- : [&gt; `Int((float, float, float)) ] = `Int((1., 2., 3.))
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-polymorphic-variants">Extending polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>When defining a polymorphic variant, you can extend an existing variant. In the following example, <code>color</code> extends <code>rgb</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> rgb = <span>[`R<span>ed</span> | `G<span>reen</span> | `B<span>lue</span>]</span>;
<span>type</span> color = <span>[<span>rgb</span> | `O<span>range</span> | `Y<span>ellow</span> | `P<span>urple</span>]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, case matters here: <code>rgb</code> being lowercased indicates that its constructors are inserted.</p>
<p>Extending multiple variants is also possible:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> red = <span>[ `R<span>ed</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> green = <span>[ `G<span>reen</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> blue = <span>[ `B<span>lue</span> ]</span>;
<span>type</span> rgb = <span>[ <span>red</span> | <span>green</span> | <span>blue</span> ]</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-namespace-of-polymorphic-constructors-is-global">The namespace of polymorphic constructors is global&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The names of non-polymorphic constructors are part of their scopes (e.g. their modules), whereas the namespace of polymorphic constructors is global. You can see that in the following example:</p>
<pre><code><span>module</span> M = {
  <span>type</span> data = <span>[`I<span>nt</span>(<span>int</span>) | `S<span>tr</span>(<span>string</span>)]</span>;
  <span>let</span> stringOfData =<span> (<span>x</span>: <span>data</span>) =&gt;</span>
    switch x {
    <span>| <span>`Int(<span>i</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> <span>string</span><span>_of_int(<span>i</span>)</span>
    <span>| <span>`Str(<span>s</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> s
    };
};
<span><span><span>M</span>.</span></span><span>string</span><span>OfData(`Int(123)</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>In the last line, the parameter of <code>M.stringOfData()</code> is created via a constructor that is not from <code>M</code>’s scope. Due to the global namespace of polymorphic constructors, the parameter is compatible with the type <code>data</code>.</p>
<h3 id="type-compatibility">Type compatibility&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>How does ReasonML determine if the type of an actual parameter (function call) is compatible with the type of the formal parameter (function definition)? Let’s look at examples. We start by creating a type and a function whose single parameter is of that type.</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a new type <code>rgb2</code> that has the same polymorphic constructors as <code>rgb</code> and call <code>id()</code> with a value whose type is <code>rgb2</code>:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb2 = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb2 = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
let arg: rgb2 = `Blue;
# id(arg);
- : rgb = `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>Normally, the type of the formal parameter <code>x</code> and the actual parameter <code>arg</code> have to be the same. But with polymorphic variants, it’s enough if your types have the same constructors.</p>
<p>If, however, the type of an actual parameter <code>arg2</code> has less constructors, then ReasonML won’t let you do the function call:</p>
<pre><code># type rg = [`Red | `Green];
type rg = [ `Green | `Red ];
# let arg2: rg = `Red;
let arg2: rg = `Red;
# id(arg2);
Error: This expression has type rg but an expression was expected of type rgb
The first variant type does not allow tag(s) `Blue
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that <code>id</code> makes precise demands on what it needs: <em>exactly</em> the constructors <code>`Red</code>, <code>`Green</code> and <code>`Blue</code>. Therefore, the type <code>rg</code> is not enough.</p>
<h4 id="from-concrete-types-to-type-constraints">From concrete types to type constraints&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Interestingly, the following does work:</p>
<pre><code># type rgb = [`Red | `Green | `Blue];
type rgb = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red ];
# let id = (x: rgb) =&gt; x;
let id: (rgb) =&gt; rgb = &lt;fun&gt;;

# let arg3 = `Red;
let arg3: [&gt; `Red ] = `Red;
# id(arg3);
- : rgb = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Why? Because ReasonML didn’t infer a fixed type for <code>arg3</code>, it inferred the <em>type constraint</em> <code>[&gt; `Red ]</code>. This constraint is a so-called <em>lower bound</em> and means: “all types that have at least the constructor <code>`Red</code>”. This constraint is compatible with <code>rgb</code>, the type of <code>x</code>.</p>
<h4 id="type-constraints-for-parameters">Type constraints for parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We can also use constraints as the types of parameters. For example, the following call to <code>id()</code> fails, because the parameter’s type, <code>rgbw</code>, has too many constructors:</p>
<pre><code># type rgbw = [`Red | `Green | `Blue | `White ];
type rgbw = [ `Blue | `Green | `Red | `White ];
# id(`Red: rgbw);
Error: This expression has type rgbw but an expression was expected of type rgb
The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `White
</code></pre>
<p>This time, we call <code>id()</code> and specify the type <code>rgbw</code> of the parameter directly (no intermediate <code>let</code> binding). We can make the function call work without changing the function call, by only changing <code>id()</code>:</p>
<pre><code># let id = (x: [&gt; `Red | `Green | `Blue]) =&gt; x;
let id: (([&gt; `Blue | `Green | `Red ] as 'a)) =&gt; 'a = &lt;fun&gt;;
# id(`Red: rgbw); /* same as before */
- : rgbw = `Red
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>x</code> has a lower bound and accepts all types that have at least the given three constructors.</p>
<p>You can also define constraints by referring to variants. For example, the following definition of <code>id()</code> is basically equivalent to the previous one.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> id =<span> (<span>x</span>: [&gt; <span>rgb</span>]) =&gt;</span> x;
</code></pre>
<p>We’ll take a deeper look at type constraints later on.</p>
<h2 id="writing-extensible-code-with-polymorphic-variants">Writing extensible code with polymorphic variants&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One key benefit of polymorphic variants is that code becomes more extensible.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-and-code-we-want-to-extend">The type and code we want to extend&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>As an example, take the following type definitions for shapes. They are polymorphic versions of the example in <a href="http://2ality.com/2017/12/variants-reasonml.html">the preceding blog post</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> point = <span>[ `P<span>oint</span>(<span>float</span>, <span>float</span>) ]</span>;
<span>type</span> shape = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Based on these type definitions, we can write a function that computes the area of a shape:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> pi = <span>4.0</span><span> *. </span>atan(<span>1.0</span>);
<span>let</span> computeArea =<span> (<span>s</span>: <span>shape</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch s {
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(`Point(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>)</span>, <span>`Point(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>)</span>) =&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> width = abs<span>_float(<span>x2</span> -. <span>x1</span>)</span>;
    <span>let</span> height = abs<span>_float(<span>y2</span> -. <span>y1</span>)</span>;
    width<span> *. </span>height;
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>radius</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> pi<span> *. </span>(radius<span> ** </span><span>2.0</span>)
  };
</code></pre>
<h3 id="extending-shape%3A-a-failing-first-attempt">Extending <code>shape</code>: a failing first attempt&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Let’s say we want to extend <code>shape</code> with one more shape – triangles. How would we do that? We can simply define a new type <code>shapePlus</code> that reuses the existing polymorphic constructors <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>, and adds the constructor <code>Triangle</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> shapePlus = <span>[
  | `R<span>ectangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
  | `C<span>ircle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>float</span>)
  | `T<span>riangle</span>(<span>point</span>, <span>point</span>, <span>point</span>)
]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Now we also need to extend <code>computeArea()</code>. The following function is our first attempt at writing that extension:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> shoelaceFormula =<span> (`P<span>oint</span>(<span>x1</span>, <span>y1</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x2</span>, <span>y2</span>), `P<span>oint</span>(<span>x3</span>, <span>y3</span>)) =&gt;</span>
  <span>0.5</span><span> *. </span>abs<span>_float(<span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> -. <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y2</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x3</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span> -. <span>x1</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> <span>+.</span> <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y3</span> -. <span>x2</span><span>*</span>.<span>y1</span>)</span>;
<span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>sp</span>)</span> 
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Alas, this code doesn’t work: In lines A and B, <code>sp</code>’s type <code>shapePlus</code> is not compatible with the type <code>shape</code> of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter. We get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Error: This expression has <span>type</span> shapePlus
but an expression was expected <span>of</span> <span>type</span> shape
The second variant <span>type</span> does not allow tag(s) `Triangle
</code></pre>
<h3 id="fixing-computeareaplus-via-an-as-clause">Fixing <code>computeAreaPlus</code> via an <code>as</code> clause&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Thankfully, we can fix the problem by using the <code>as</code> clause for the last two cases:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Rectangle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> r =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>r</span>)</span>
  <span>| <span>`Circle(<span>_</span>, <span>_</span>)</span> <span>as</span> c =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>c</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>How does <code>as</code> help us? With polymorphic variants, it picks the most general type possible. That is:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Rectangle(point, point)]</code></li>
<li><code>c</code> has the type <code>[&gt; `Circle(point, float)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these types are compatible with <code>shape</code>, the type of <code>computeArea</code>’s parameter.</p>
<h3 id="the-final-solution">The final solution&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There is one more improvement we can make. Given the following variant:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> myvariant = <span>[`C1(<span>t1</span>) | `C2(<span>t2</span>)]</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Then the following two patterns are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>#myvariant
(<span>`C1(<span>_</span>: <span>t1</span>)</span> <span>| <span>`C2(<span>_</span>: <span>t2</span>)</span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we use the hash for the type <code>shape</code>, we get:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> computeAreaPlus =<span> (<span>sp</span>: <span>shapePlus</span>) =&gt;</span>
  switch sp {
  <span>| <span>`Triangle(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span> =&gt;</span> shoelace<span>Formula(<span>p1</span>, <span>p2</span>, <span>p3</span>)</span>
  <span>| #shape <span>as</span> s =&gt;</span> compute<span>Area(<span>s</span>)</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s use <code>computeAreaPlus()</code> with two shapes:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> top = <span>`Point(3.0, 5.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> left = <span>`Point(0.0, 0.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> right = <span>`Point(3.0, 0.0)</span>;

<span>let</span> circ = <span>`Circle(<span>top</span>, 3.0)</span>;
<span>let</span> tri = <span>`Triangle(<span>top</span>, <span>left</span>, <span>right</span>)</span>;

compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>circ</span>)</span>; 
compute<span>AreaPlus(<span>tri</span>)</span>; 
</code></pre>
<p>We have therefore successfully extended both the type <code>shape</code> and the function <code>computeArea()</code> operating on it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, there was an announcement about <a href="https://twitter.com/Calista_Redmond/status/1154278392344305664">a new RISC-V chip</a>, which has got a lot of people excited. I wish I could also be excited, but to me, this is just a reminder that RISC architectures are fundamentally unscalable, and inevitably stop being RISC as soon as they need to be fast. People still call ARM a “RISC” architecture despite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#ARMv8.3-A">ARMv8.3-A adding a <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction</a>, which is “Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed-point, rounding toward Zero”. Reduced instruction set, my ass.</p><p>The reason this keeps happening is because <strong>the laws of physics</strong> ensure that no RISC architecture can scale under load. The problem is that a modern CPU is so fast that just accessing the L1 cache takes anywhere from <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Skylake_X.html">3-5 cycles</a>. This is part of the reason modern CPUs rely so much on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_renaming">register renaming</a>, allowing them to have hundreds of internal registers that are used to make things go fast, as opposed to the paltry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#/media/File:Table_of_x86_Registers_svg.svg">90 registers actually exposed</a>, 40 of which are just floating point registers for vector operations. The fundamental issue that CPU architects run into is that <strong>the speed of light isn't getting any faster</strong>. Even getting an electrical signal from one end of a CPU to the other now takes more than one cycle, which means the physical layout of your CPU now has a significant impact on how fast operations take. Worse, the faster the CPU gets, the more this lag becomes a problem, so unless you shrink the entire CPU or redesign it so your L1 and L2 caches are <em>physically closer to the transistors that need them</em>, the latency from accessing those caches can only go up, not down. The CPU might be getting faster, but the speed of light isn't.</p><p>Now, obviously RISC CPUs are very complicated architectures that do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_RISC_pipeline#Hazard">all sorts of insane pipelining</a> to try and execute as many instructions at the same time as possible. This is necessary because, unless your data is already loaded into registers, you might spend more cycles <em>loading data from the L1 cache</em> than doing the actual operation! If you hit the L2 cache, that will cost you 13-20 cycles by itself, and L3 cache hits are 60-100 cycles. This is made worse by the fact that complex floating-point operations can almost always be performed faster by encoding the operation in hardware, often in just one or two cycles, when manually implementing the same operation would've taken 8 or more cycles. The <code>FJCVTZS</code> instruction mentioned above even <a href="https://community.arm.com/developer/ip-products/processors/b/processors-ip-blog/posts/armv8-a-architecture-2016-additions">sets a specific flag based on certain edge-cases</a> to allow an immediate jump instruction to be done afterwards, again to minimize hitting the cache.</p><p>All of this leads us to <strong>single instruction multiple data (SIMD)</strong> vector instructions common to almost all modern CPUs. Instead of doing a complex operation on a single float, they do a simple operation to many floats at once. The CPU can perform operations on 4, 8, or even 16 floating point numbers at the same time, in just 3 or 4 cycles, even though doing this for an individual float would have cost 2 or 3 cycles <em>each</em>. Even loading an array of floats into a large register will be faster than loading each float individually. There is no escaping the fact that attempting to run instructions one by one, even with fancy pipelining, will usually result in a CPU that's simply not doing anything most of the time. In order to make things go fast, you have to do things in bulk. This means having instructions that do as many things as possible, which is the exact opposite of how RISC works.</p><p>Now, this does not mean CISC is the future. We already invented a solution to this problem, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word">VLIW - Very Large Instruction Word</a>. This is what Itanium was, because researchers at HP anticipated this problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium#Development:_1989%E2%80%932000">30 years ago</a> and teamed up with Intel to create what eventually became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">Itanium</a>. In Itanium, or any VLIW architecture, you can tell the CPU to do <strong>many things at once</strong>. This means that, instead of having to build massive vector processing instructions or other complex specialized instructions, you can build your own mega-instructions out of a much simpler instruction set. This is great, because it simplifies the CPU design enormously while sidestepping the pipelining issues of RISC. The problem is that <em>this is really fucking hard to compile</em>, and that's what Intel screwed up. Intel assumed that compilers in 2001 could extract the instruction-level parallelism necessary to make VLIW work, but in reality we've only <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02816.pdf">very recently figured out how to reliably do that</a>. 20 years ago, we weren't even close, so nobody could compile fast code for Itanium, and now Itanium is dead, even though it was specifically designed to solve our current predicament.</p><p>With that said, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture">MILL instruction set</a> uses VLIW along with several other innovations designed to compensate for a lot of the problems discussed here, like having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E4qs2irmpc&amp;t=26m45s">deferred load instructions</a> to account for the lag time between requesting a piece of data and actually being able to use it (which, incidentally, also makes MILL immune to Spectre because it doesn't need to speculate). Sadly, MILL is currently still vaporware, having not materialized any actual hardware despite it's promising performance gains. One reason for this might be that any VLIW architecture has a highly unique instruction set. We're used to x86, which is so high-level it has almost nothing to do with the underlying CPU implementation. This is nice, because everyone implements the same instruction set and your programs all work on it, but it means the way instructions interact is hard to predict, much to the frustration of compiler optimizers. With VLIW, you would very likely have to recompile your program for <strong>every single unique CPU</strong>, which is a problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_architecture#Family_traits">MILL has spent quite a bit of time on</a>.</p><p>MILL, and perhaps VLIW in general, may have a saving grace with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, precisely because it is a low-level assembly language that can be efficiently compiled to any architecture. It wouldn't be a problem to have unique instruction sets for every single type of CPU, because if you ship WebAssembly, you can simply compile the program for whatever CPU it happens to be running on. A lot of people miss this benefit of WebAssembly, even though I think it will be critical in allowing VLIW instruction sets to eventually proliferate. Perhaps MILL will see the light of day after all, or maybe someone else can come up with a VLIW version of RISC-V that's open-source. Either way, we need to stop pretending that pipelining RISC is going to work. It hasn't ever worked and it's not going to work, it'll just turn into another CISC with a javascript floating point conversion instruction.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p></div></div>]]>

                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

    <p>As we all know, Cyberpunk 2077 had a rocky start, but it’s not unexpected with a game of this scope.
It came to my attention that it’s been investigated that the game doesn’t take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading">SMT</a> 
on AMD CPUs and that there’s a fix for it. While the discovery was legitimate and interesting,
it was quickly followed by misinformation and strong statements. In this post,
I’ll summarize my findings previously scattered around Reddit and <strong>try</strong> to clarify some of the statements.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I tried to present those findings the best I could. However, it is not possible to be 100% certain about the choices made
by the dev team nor whether the fix is universally beneficial. You may rely on profiling data gathered from the community,
but only in-depth profiling of the game’s code can provide an indisputable answer. This is not something we can do.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>First of all, credits for finding this go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnhingedDoork/">UnhingedDoork</a>
(aka <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BS_BlackScout/">BS_BlackScout</a>).
He dived into the game’s binary and found an interesting piece of code, checking via <code>cpuid</code> for the CPU vendor and some other
attributes (later revealed to be CPU family). That’s how this function looks in pseudocode (variables omitted for readability):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sub_142A82270</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>sub_142A822F0</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>v17</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v16</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>

  <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span><span>)</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>0xF</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>15</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>v10</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>_RAX</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>15</span><span>;</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v17</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>v10</span> <span>==</span> <span>21</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>v16</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>The proposed fix neutralizes the <code>strcmp</code> check, making all CPUs take the <code>return v16</code> code path, previously taken only by Intel.
This very simple change reportedly can result in huge performance boosts on some configurations – while I haven’t been able to verify it myself,
reports came from various places and they generally seem great, with some people getting moderate gains while others getting huge speedups.
Do note, however, that there have also been reports of no performance increase, so this change should not be considered a “silver bullet for performance”.</p>

<p>Sadly, this great find quickly sparkled incorrect conclusions. I first learned of this issue from a topic named</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077 used an Intel C++ compiler which hinders optimizations if run on non-Intel CPUs</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>which naturally caused people to come up with conspiracy theories. However, knowing that the Visual Studio compiler is pretty much an industry-standard
I’d be very surprised if this was true, so I dived and checked what this code truly is.</p>

<p>I originally posted my findings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/kbsywg/cyberpunk_2077_used_an_intel_c_compiler_which/gfknein/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">on Reddit</a>,
and they are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This check doesn’t come from ICC, but from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/cpu-core-counts/blob/master/windows/ThreadCount-Win7.cpp#L69">GPUOpen</a>, a library from AMD which is also mentioned
in the game’s credits. Comparing the game’s function with the linked one reveals they are identical. There is no evidence that Cyberpunk uses ICC,
furthermore according to VirusTotal Visual Studio 2015 compiler has been used.</li>
  <li>With this knowledge, we can see that on non-Bulldozer AMD CPUs the function returns the number of physical cores, while for Intel and AMD Bulldozer chips it returns the number of logical cores.
With this change in place, the function returns the number of logical cores regardless of the CPU vendor.</li>
  <li>This function is used in numerous places, but most notably it is used in what appears to be an initialization function of the game’s job dispatcher system.
This value seems to drive a <code>MaxHWConcurrency</code> attribute, so in my opinion, it may be used e.g. to decide how many worker threads to spawn. This would at least explain higher CPU usage,
since this change most likely gives the game’s job system twice the amount of threads, thus distributing the work across logical cores more evenly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why was it done? I don’t know, since it comes from GPUOpen I don’t think this check is “wrong” per se, but maybe it should not have been used in Cyberpunk due to the way it utilizes threads.
Even the comment in this code snippet advises caution, after all. Again, <strong>we can’t know for certain</strong>, but in my opinion, this decision could have been made due to any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At some point, this change resulted in a performance boost but later changes and/or optimization may have made it less effective.</li>
  <li>Reportedly, this change helps AMD CPUs with one CCX unit and can make the game slower on CPUs with multiple CCX units. This code may have been tailored to only one type of CPU
and not the other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I’d just like to highlight what <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/cpu-core-count-detection-windows/">AMD says about this GPUOpen functionality</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our sample code, linked below, errs on the side of caution for our Ryzen processors and encourages you to profile: the <code>getDefaultThreadCount()</code> function draws attention to that fact, 
<strong>returning a starting default count equal to the number of physical processor cores on Ryzen.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It goes without saying that I cannot guarantee any improvements with this change applied, but you’re welcome to experiment.
Again, the original author of those instructions is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/kbp0np/cyberpunk_2077_seems_to_ignore_smt_and_mostly/gfkmc7d/?context=3">UnhingedDoork</a>
and I am only mirroring them here. Since I don’t have an AMD CPU, I cannot test those:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the EXE with HxD (Hex Editor).</li>
  <li>Look for a <code>75 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code> hex string.</li>
  <li>Change it to <code>EB 30 33 C9 B8 01 00 00 00 0F A2 8B C8 C1 F9 08</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternately, you may try a <a href="https://github.com/yamashi/PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk">PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk</a> mod which applies those changes, similarly to my ASI-based mods.
Again, I have not tested this, so I cannot guarantee any improvements. Use with caution.</p>

<p>I have been working on porting GLIBC to the OpenRISC architecture.  This has
taken longer than I expected as with GLIBC upstreaming we must get every
test to pass.  This was different compared to GDB and GCC which were a
bit more lenient.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://lists.librecores.org/pipermail/openrisc/2020-May/002602.html">first upstreaming attempt</a>
was completely tested on the <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> simulator.  I have
since added an FPGA <a href="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/blob/master/README.md">LiteX SoC</a>
to my test platform options.  LiteX runs Linux on the OpenRISC mor1kx softcore
and tests are loaded over an SSH session.  The SoC eliminates an issue I was
seeing on the simulator where under heavy load it appears the <a href="https://github.com/openrisc/linux/issues/12">MMU starves the kernel</a>
from getting any work done.</p>

<p>To get to where I am now this required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixing buggy <a href="https://github.com/litex-hub/linux/commit/78969c54328e35b360d9452c7602f21107a13d22">LiteETH network driver</a>
in LiteX.</li>
  <li>Updating the OpenRISC GDB port to <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/9d0d2e9bef5c84caa7f05cc7ddba1e092e2b5120">support gdbserver</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/binutils-gdb/commit/82e99d5df56be3b18c63e613d00e2367fb5a78b7">native debugging</a></li>
  <li>Fixing bugs in the <a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/linux/commit/28b852b1dc351efc6525234c5adfd5bc2ad6d6e1">Linux Kernel</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/stffrdhrn/or1k-glibc/commit/75ddf155968299042e4d2b492e3b547c86d4672e">GLIBC</a> to get gdbserver and native support working</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding GDB Linux debugging support is great because it allows debugging of
multithreaded processes and signal handling; which we are going to need.</p>

<h2 id="a-bug">A Bug</h2>

<p>Our story starts when I was trying to fix a failing GLIBC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_POSIX_Thread_Library">NPTL</a>
test case.  The test case involves C++ exceptions and POSIX threads.
The issue is that the <code>catch</code> block of a <code>try/catch</code> block is not
being called.  Where do we even start?</p>

<p>My plan for approaching test case failures is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand what the test case is trying to test and where its failing</li>
  <li>Create a hypothesis about where the problem is</li>
  <li>Understand how the failing API’s works internally</li>
  <li>Debug until we find the issue</li>
  <li>If we get stuck go back to <code>2.</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s have a try.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-test-case">Understanding the Test case</h3>

<p>The GLIBC test case is <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/tst-cancel24.cc;h=1af709a8cab1d422ef4401e2b2d178df86f863c5;hb=HEAD">nptl/tst-cancel24.cc</a>.
The test starts in the <code>do_test</code> function and it will create a child thread with <code>pthread_create</code>.
The child thread executes function <code>tf</code> which waits on a semaphore until the parent thread cancels it.  It
is expected that the child thread, when cancelled , will call it’s catch block.</p>

<p>The failure is that the <code>catch</code> block is not getting run as evidenced by the <code>except_caught</code> variable
not being set to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an excerpt from the test showing the <code>tf</code> function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span>
<span>tf</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>sem_t</span> <span>*</span><span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>sem_t</span> <span>*&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>);</span>

  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>

      <span>pthread_barrier_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>b</span><span>);</span>

      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>
        <span>sem_wait</span> <span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
      <span>throw</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the <code>catch</code> block is not being run.  Simple, but where do we start to
debug that?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-hypothesis">Creating a Hypothesis</h3>

<p>This one is a bit tricky as it seems C++ <code>try/catch</code> blocks are broken. Here, I am
working on GLIBC testing, what does that have to do with C++?</p>

<p>To get a better idea of where the problem is I tried to modify the test to test
some simple ideas. First, maybe there is a problem with catching exceptions
throws from thread child functions.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>throw</span> <span>99</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

<span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span> <span>tf</span> <span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>monitor</span> <span>m</span><span>;</span>
      <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>do_throw</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(...)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>except_caught</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No, this works correctly.  So <code>try/catch</code> is working.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: There is a problem handling exceptions while in a syscall.
There may be something broken with OpenRISC related to how we setup stack
frames for syscalls that makes the unwinder fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that work?  Let’s move onto the next step.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-internals">Understanding the Internals</h3>

<p>To find this bug we need to understand how C++ exceptions work.  Also, we need to know
what happens when a thread is cancelled in a multithreaded
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads">pthread</a>) glibc environment.</p>

<p>There are a few contributors pthread cancellation and C++ exceptions which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DWARF</strong> - provided by our program and libraries in the <code>.eh_frame</code> ELF
section</li>
  <li><strong>GLIBC</strong> - provides the pthread runtime and cleanup callbacks to the GCC unwinder code</li>
  <li><strong>GCC</strong> - provides libraries for dealing with exceptions
    <ul>
      <li><code>libgcc_s.so</code> - handles unwinding by reading program <strong>DWARF</strong> metadata and doing the frame decoding</li>
      <li><code>libstdc++.so.6</code> - provides the C++ personality routine which
identifies and prepares <code>catch</code> blocks for execution</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dwarf">DWARF</h4>
<p>ELF binaries provide debugging information in a data format called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF">DWARF</a>.  The name was chosen to maintain a
fantasy theme.  Lately the Linux community has a new debug format called
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/728339/">ORC</a>.</p>

<p>Though DWARF is a debugging format and usually stored in <code>.debug_frame</code>,
<code>.debug_info</code>, etc sections, a stripped down version it is used for exception
handling.</p>

<p>Each ELF binary that supports unwinding contains the <code>.eh_frame</code> section to
provide unwinding information.  This can be seen with the <code>readelf</code> program.</p>

<p>We can decode the metadata using <code>readelf</code> as well using the
<code>--debug-dump=frames-interp</code> and <code>--debug-dump=frames</code> arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>frames</code> dump provides a raw output of the DWARF metadata for each frame.
This is not usually as useful as <code>frames-interp</code>, but it shows how the DWARF
format is actually a bytecode.  The DWARF interpreter needs to execute these
operations to understand how to derive the values of registers based current PC.</p>

<p>There is an interesting talk in <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/battleaxe/hackito_2011_oakley_bratus.pdf">Exploiting the hard-working
DWARF.pdf</a>.</p>

<h4 id="glibc">GLIBC</h4>

<p>GLIBC provides <code>pthreads</code> which when used with C++ needs to support exception
handling.  The main place exceptions are used with <code>pthreads</code> is when cancelling
threads.  When using <code>pthread_cancel</code> a cancel signal is sent to the target thread using <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tgkill.2.html">tgkill</a>
which causes an exception.</p>

<p>This is implemented with the below APIs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/nptl-init.c;h=53b817715d58192857ed14450052e16dc34bc01b;hb=HEAD#l126">sigcancel_handler</a> -
Setup during the pthread runtime initialization, it handles cancellation,
which calls <code>__do_cancel</code>, which calls <code>__pthread_unwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l121">__pthread_unwind</a> -
Is called with <code>pd-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>.  It calls glibc’s <code>__Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/nptl/unwind-forcedunwind.c;h=50a089282bc236aa644f40feafd0dacdafe3a4e7;hb=HEAD#l122">_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</a> -
Loads GCC’s <code>libgcc_s.so</code> version of <code>_Unwind_ForcedUnwind</code>
and calls it with parameters:
    <ul>
      <li><code>exc</code> - the exception context</li>
      <li><code>unwind_stop</code> - the stop callback to GLIBC, called for each frame of the unwind, with
the stop argument <code>ibuf</code></li>
      <li><code>ibuf</code> - the <code>jmp_buf</code>, created by <code>setjmp</code> (<code>self-&gt;cancel_jmp_buf</code>) in <code>start_thread</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/unwind.c;h=8f157e49f4a088ac64722e85ff24514fff7f3c71;hb=HEAD#l39">unwind_stop</a> -
Checks the current state of unwind and call the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> if
we are at the end of stack.  When the <code>cancel_jmp_buf</code> is called the thread
exits.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post is also <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2020-11-18.md">available at my personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>Materialize allows you to maintain declarative, relational SQL queries over continually changing data. One of the most powerful features of SQL queries are <em>joins</em>: the ability to correlate records from multiple collections of data. Joins also happen to be one of the harder things to do both correctly and efficiently as the underlying data change.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the ways that Materialize maintains queries containing joins!</p>
<p>In particular, we’ll see increasingly sophisticated join planning techniques, starting from what a conventional dataflow system might do, and moving through joins that can introduce nearly zero per-query overhead. Each of the new join plans we work through represent an implementation strategy that Materialize can do that other dataflow systems will struggle to replicate.</p>
<p>As we move through techniques, the number of private intermediate records maintained by each query dataflows drops. We’ll report all 22 TPC-H queries at the end, but here are two of the largely representative queries, and the number of <em>additional</em> records Materialize maintains to keep the query results up to date.</p>
<pre><code>|   query 03 |  query 08 | technique         |
| ----------:|----------:|------------------ |
|  4,173,794 | 7,111,507 | Baseline          |
|  3,416,347 | 6,142,311 | Primary indexes   |
|    174,571 |   141,228 | Secondary indexes |
|     23,240 |         6 | Delta queries     |
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these techniques are live in <a href="https://materialize.com/download">Materialize</a> now. Each comes on-line in response to indexes that you ask Materialize to prepare. The more prepared indexes, the less per-query memory required (admittedly, the more baseline memory required as well).</p>
<p>At the end, we’ll have a forward-looking <a href="#Joins-in-Materialize:-Late-Materialization">discussion of late-materialization</a> which can further reduce the memory requirements, in a way that currently requires user assistance (we’re working on it!). Throughout, the story is that Materialize can invoke efficient join patterns from relational databases in the context of scale-out dataflow processors.</p>
<h2>Introducing Joins</h2>
<p>Let’s take a super-simple example of an “equi-join”:</p>
<pre><code>-- Collect customer names and states of residence.
SELECT
    customer.name,
    location.state
FROM
    customer,
    location
WHERE
    customer.zip = location.zip
</code></pre>
<p>Here  we have two collection of data, <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. We want to pick out pairs from each that match on their <code>zip</code> field. Although we didn’t write the word <code>JOIN</code>, that is what happens in SQL when you use multiple input collections.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems will plan this join using a relatively simple dataflow graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>Information about the <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code> collections flows in along their respective edges. For example, when records are added, removed, or updated, that information flows as data along an edge. The <code>join</code> operator receives this information, and must correctly respond to it with any changes to its output collection. For example, if we add a record to <code>customer</code>, the output must be updated to include any matches between that record and <code>location</code>; this probably means a new output record with the customer name and the state corresponding to its ZIP code.</p>
<p>Most dataflow systems implement the <code>join</code> operator by having it maintain its two inputs each in an index. As changes arrive for either input, the operator can look at their <code>zip</code> fields and immediately leap to the matching records in the <em>other</em> collection. This allows the operator to quickly respond to record additions, deletions, or changes with the corresponding output addition, deletion, or change.</p>
<p>The operator maintains state proportional to the current records in each of its inputs.</p>
<p>You may have noticed the  “most dataflow systems” refrain repeated above. Materialize will do things slightly differently, in a way that can be substantially better.</p>
<h2>Binary Joins in Materialize</h2>
<p>Materialize plans joins using a slightly different dataflow plan:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure1.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We have broken the traditional <code>join</code> operator into three parts. Each of the inputs first visits an <code>arrange</code> operator, whose results then go to a <code>join_core</code> operator. The <code>arrange</code> operators are in charge of <em>building and maintaining</em> the indexed representations of their inputs. The <code>join_core</code> operator takes two pre-indexed, maintained collections and applies the join <em>logic</em> to the changes that move through them.</p>
<p>Why break apart the <code>join</code> operator into <code>arrange</code> and <code>join_core</code>?</p>
<p>As you may know from relational databases, a small number of indexes can service a large volume of queries. The same is true in Materialize: we can re-use the indexed representations of collections across many independent joins. By separating the operator into 1. data organization and 2. computation, we can more easily slot in shared, re-used arrangements of data. This can result in a substantial reduction in the amount of memory required, as compared to traditional dataflow systems.</p>
<p>Let’s take the example above, using <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>. The standard dataflow system will build <em>private</em> indexes of <code>customer</code> and <code>location</code>, each indexed by their <code>zip</code> field. The <code>zip</code> field in <code>location</code> may be a primary key, meaning each record has a different value of the field. Joins using primary keys are effectively “look-ups” and are quite common. Each such look-up would be a join using <code>location.zip</code> and would require the same index. We can build the index once, and re-use it across all of the query dataflows that need it.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/figure2.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We would still need a private copy of <code>customer</code> indexed by <code>zip</code>, but as we will see next there are standard clever idioms from databases that can make this efficient as well.</p>
<h2>Joins in Materialize: TPC-H examples</h2>
<p>Let’s work through a query from the TPC-H data warehousing benchmark.<br>
Query 03 is designed to match the following description:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The query itself is:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
    customer,
    orders,
    lineitem
WHERE
    c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
    AND c_custkey = o_custkey
    AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
    AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
GROUP BY
    l_orderkey,
    o_orderdate,
    o_shippriority
ORDER BY
    revenue desc,
    o_orderdate;
</code></pre>
<p>The absence of <code>LIMIT 10</code> from the query is just how TPC-H defines things. In the interest of clarity we are going to work on the core of the query, without the <code>ORDER BY</code> or elided <code>LIMIT</code>. The query is a three-way join between <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code>, followed by a reduction. The reduction keys seem to be three random fields, but notice that <code>l_orderkey = o_orderkey</code>, where <code>o_orderkey</code> is a primary key for <code>orders</code>; we are producing an aggregate for each order.</p>
<p>We’ll be using the scale-factor 1 dataset, as it what I have locally and it is good enough to call out some of the trade-offs. You can mentally multiply the numbers we’ll see by various powers of ten, and the same conclusions will hold.</p>
<h3>Joins in Materialize: A first implementation</h3>
<p>We can turn on <code>materialize</code> and frame the query above, using the <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ..</code> syntax. This instructs <code>materialize</code> to spin up a dataflow to read and maintain the results of the query. We can do this with no other preparation (other than creating the <code>customer</code>, <code>orders</code>, and <code>lineitem</code> data sources).</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW query_03 AS
materialize-&gt; SELECT
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority,
materialize-&gt;     sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
materialize-&gt; FROM
materialize-&gt;     customer,
materialize-&gt;     orders,
materialize-&gt;     lineitem
materialize-&gt; WHERE
materialize-&gt;     c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
materialize-&gt;     AND c_custkey = o_custkey
materialize-&gt;     AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
materialize-&gt;     AND o_orderdate &lt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt;     AND l_shipdate &gt; DATE '1995-03-15'
materialize-&gt; GROUP BY
materialize-&gt;     l_orderkey,
materialize-&gt;     o_orderdate,
materialize-&gt;     o_shippriority;
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we should have efficient random access to the results. There are many results, so let’s just count them instead.</p>
<pre><code>materialize=&gt; select count(*) from query_03;
 count
-------
 11620
(1 row)

Time: 12.927 ms
materialize=&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At the same time, maintaining this query comes with a cost. The dataflow that maintains <code>query_03</code> maintains several indexes over input and intermediate data. Here is a sketch of what the dataflow graph looks like for the query deployed against the raw data.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frankmcsherry/blog/master/assets/joins/tpch0.png" alt="" width="700"></p>
<p>We can read out these volumes from <code>materialize</code>‘s logging views. To read out the total records maintained by each dataflow, we would type</p>
<pre><code>-- dataflow and number of records it is sitting on.
SELECT id, name, sum(records)
FROM mz_records_per_dataflow
GROUP BY id, name
ORDER BY sum(records) desc;
</code></pre>
<p>When we do, we see (truncated):</p>
<pre><code>      id  |                         name                          |   sum
    ------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------
--&gt;   490 | Dataflow: materialize.public.query_03_primary_idx     | 4173794
      ...
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us that our dataflow maintains some 4,173,794 records for the <code>query_03</code> dataflow. These are in support of maintaining the 11,620 results from that query, which may seem disproportionate. The explanation is that this dataflow needs to maintain each of its inputs, which are not otherwise stored within <code>materialize</code>. For example, the <code>lineitem</code> relation has six million records, and we need to maintain all relevant records (not all of them, as the filter on date removes roughly half of them).</p>
<p>However, there is a substantial cost to maintaining this query. …</p></div></div>

<p>by Gianni Tedesco</p>

<p>Some pythonistas wonder what is the fastest way to write a function to
partition a sequence of items in to two lists based on some predicate. One
could, to be sure, <code>filter</code> the list and then <code>filterfalse</code> the list. But in
this case the predicate will evaluated twice for each item - an inefficiency
that some would balk at. That approach also doesn’t seem very parsimonious.</p>

<p>This problem has inspired several broad classes of solutions based on different
needs and priorities and some very minor controversy about which is the most
efficient. I hope to clear up the question of efficiency by introducing a new
variant here today.</p>


<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>foos</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
<span>bars</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>x</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>input</span> <span>if</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>not</span> <span>in</span> <span>known_foos</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s a DRY itch. Quite irritating. It calls for a salve. Surely Python would
have a solution for this? It has an expansive standard library…</p>


<p>The suggestion in the <code>itertools</code> documentation is to use <code>tee</code> in an elegant
way, along with <code>filter</code> and <code>filterfalse</code>, which are also both in the standard
libraries. This approach also has the benefit of working with arbitrary
generators. It can even, in principle, handle an infinitely long input
sequence.</p>

<p>It’s quite clever, so it’s worth mentioning.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>itertools</span> <span>import</span> <span>tee</span><span>,</span> <span>filterfalse</span>

<span>def</span> <span>stdlib</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>tee</span><span>(</span><span>it</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>filterfalse</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But the problem is that it’s also quite slow when you’re just going to be
materialising the results immediately. To see why, imagine calling it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>hay</span><span>,</span> <span>needles</span> <span>=</span> <span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>needle_set</span><span>,</span> <span>haystack</span><span>)</span>
<span>return</span> <span>Results</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span><span>hay</span><span>),</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>needles</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As soon as we materialise one of the returned generators, tee will internally
materialise haystack in to a temporary list. And the predicates are still being evaluated twice, once for each fork of the <code>tee</code>.</p>

<p>But I can see this sort of thing being useful in a graph of <code>asyncio</code> tasks or
something. Maybe one day I will find myself in a situation where I would need
to use a cool technique like this.</p>


<p>But let’s forget about possibly-infinite generators and lazy evaluation and
just consider the case of a list that we want to partition in to two new lists.</p>

<p>For that case case, I’ve seen a couple of clever approaches.</p>

<p>The first one is quite quick to type and nice and readable. It involves using
the result of the predicate function to index in to the results tuple. It takes
advantage of the fact that <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> cast to <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> when used to
index a tuple.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>trevor</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[])</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>ret</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Honestly, this probably would have been my go-to approach, but it actually
turns out to be quite slow.</p>

<p>The second is a very functional-style solution, straight out of some sort of
Haskellers PhD thesis, proposed by stackoverflow member Mariy. This one uses
<code>functools.reduce</code>, which is pythons version of <code>foldl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>mariy</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>reduce</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)].</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>or</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>,</span> <span>([],</span> <span>[]))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In princple, this is the same as the above but it takes advantage fo the fact
that reduce performs some of the boilerplate for you.</p>

<p>I expect it to be a bit less efficient since it creates as many result tuples
as there are elements in the input list. Repetetive object creation and
destruction is a common source of overhead in python.</p>


<p>According to gboffi, it turns out the fastest solution that
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4578590/python-equivalent-of-filter-getting-two-output-lists-i-e-partition-of-a-list/52822805#52822805">stackoverflow</a>
came up with is just the straight forward version, credited to Mark Byers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>byers</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, knowing something about optimizing python code, I can see a clear
opportunity to speed this up.</p>


<p>We can disassemble this to python bytecode with <code>dis</code>. Generally speaking, the
main determinant of performance in these kind of loops is the number of
bytecode instructions which need to be dispatched per iteration.</p>

<p>So here is what the Byers version compiles to in cpython 3.9:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inner loop is between locations 12 and 46. It’s 18 instructions long.</p>

<p>We can see that the append code has some duplicated instructions in each branch
(24-34, and 36-46), but since only one branch is taken at a time, that
shouldn’t really be counted.</p>

<p>So if we measure the actual instruction path-length per iteration, it comes out
to 12 instructions.</p>

<p>More importantly, we can see that inside that inner loop we’re doing a lookup
of the <code>append</code> method, which is actually looking up a string in a dictionary.
For this reason, the <code>LOAD_GLOBAL</code> and <code>LOAD_METHOD</code> calls are among the
slowest of the basic instruction types in the python machine (not including the
instructions which call out to python subroutines, of course).</p>


<p>We have probably all heard that python is a dynamic language. But we may not
know what all of the consequences of that fact are. For one thing, it means
that attribute lookups are often expensive dictionary lookups. But it also
means that even some very obvious optimisations <em>simply cannot be made</em>. For
example, the python compiler cannot, in general, optimise:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program A
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Program B
</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
<span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
<span>for</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span>
    <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reason for this is that the method <code>list.append</code> is absolutely free to
assign a different value to <code>self.append</code>. This means that programs A and B are
(or at least, may be) semantically different. Therefore B is not a valid
optimization of A.</p>

<p>Now you might think that, well, the bytecode compiler can know about the
implementation of <code>list.append</code> because it’s built-in. Which is true. But it
doesn’t stop any other code, for example in <code>b.__iter__.next()</code> from obtaining
a reference to <code>x</code> via any number of mechanisms and then altering its attribute
dict.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t even have to resort to reflection - the local variable <code>x</code> could
just be a reference to an object which is also reachable in a global scope. And
what variables there are in the global scope can be modified on the fly by any
code so it wouldn’t be enough to do an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_analysis">escape-analysis</a> at compile
time.</p>

<p>Frankly there are just too many avenues in python for this sort of
jiggery-pokery to take place. And these avenues are kind of the point of
python.</p>


<p>OK, that’s interesting, but what if we just explicitly apply the above
optimisation?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>
    <span>ts</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>fs</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>ts</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>=</span> <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>append</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>pred</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>):</span>
            <span>t</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
        <span>else</span><span>:</span>
            <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>fs</span><span>,</span> <span>ts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can see from the bytecode that this has reduced the instruction path-length
as we expected:</p>

<p>The inner loop takes place between locations 24 and 48. It’s 16 instructions
long. And if we look at the instruction path length for the loop, it’s now 11
instructions long. One shorter than before. Of course, it’s that missing
<code>LOAD_ATTR</code> instruction which has been hoisted out of the loop in to the
function preamble.</p>


<p>I couldn’t figure out a way to get the inner loop any tighter but I did find a
way to make the code more compact by removing duplicated code on both sides of
the branch. It led to a tiny improvement in performance. Here it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>scara2</span><span>(</span><span>pred</span><span>,</span> <span>it</span><span>):</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p><em>Adi Shamir’s Secret Sharing</em> is a cryptographic algorithm that allows distinct parties to jointly share ownership of a single secret by holding <em>shares</em>. The original secret can only be reconstructed by using a minimum number of shares, which allows different parties to cooperate without the need to fully trust one another.</p>
<h2>Example Problem</h2>
<p>To illustrate, let’s imagine that a family of four all share a single Bitcoin wallet. This Bitcoin wallet contains a single private key that all members of the family co-own. Because there is a single key, any of the family members can use that key to spend all of the Bitcoins. </p>
<p>The family has a problem: If they each keep a copy, then only one of their copies needs to be compromised to have all the coins stolen. If only one of them keeps the key, then that person may lose it or decide to double-cross the other family members.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the family members is also a cryptographer. Instead of naively sharing the original key, they use SSS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shamir’s secret sharing</a>). The family creates four shares and sets a threshold of three, with the Bitcoin key as the original secret. Now, their plan has the following properties:</p>
<ul><li>They have not stored the bitcoin key in a single place which makes it harder to steal</li><li>Members of the family need to cooperate to spend the Bitcoin, one family member can’t betray the others</li><li>If a family member dies or loses their share, the other three members can still reconstruct the key</li></ul>
<h2>Understanding the Threshold</h2>
<p>Every Shamir sharing scheme has a total number of shares and a threshold. The <strong>threshold is the number of shares required</strong> to reconstruct the original secret. For example, with five shares and a threshold of three, you only need three of the five shares to calculate the original secret.</p>
<h2>The Math – Lines</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental mathematical properties used in Shamir’s secret sharing is the fact that it takes <em>k</em> points to define a polynomial of degree <em>k </em>– 1. For example:</p>
<ul><li>Only one line can be drawn between two points</li><li>Only one possible parabola crosses through the same three points</li><li>Only one cubic curve passes through the same four points</li><li>An infinite number of lines can be drawn through the same point</li><li>An infinite number of parabolas can be drawn through the same two points</li></ul>
<h2>The Math – Walkthrough</h2>
<p>Let us construct a scheme to share our secret 1954 (<em>S)</em> with 4 (<em>n)</em> shares and a threshold of 3 (<em>k)</em>.</p>
<p>First, we randomly choose <em>k</em> – 1 positive integers, so in our case, 2 positive integers. We randomly choose 43 and 12.</p>
<p>Then, we build a polynomial of the form</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2</code></pre>
<p>Where a0 is the secret, and a1 and a2 are our randomly chosen integers. We are left with:</p>
<pre><code lang="bash">y = 1954 + 43x + 12x^2</code></pre>
<p>Then, we use this formula to create 4 points (shares) that we give to each participant.</p>
<h3><span>Share 1</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 1</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*1 + 12*1^2 = 2009</p>
<p>(1, 2009)</p>
<h3><span>Share 2</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 2</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*2 + 12*2^2 = 2088</p>
<p>(2, 2088)</p>
<h3><span>Share 3</span> </h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 3</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*3 + 12*3^2 = 2191</p>
<p>(3, 2191)</p>
<h3><span>Share 4</span></h3>
<p>(x, y) where x = 4</p>
<p>y = 1954 + 43*4 + 12*4^2 = 2318</p>
<p>(4, 2318)</p>
<h2>Reconstruction</h2>
<p>Each participant in our scheme now owns one <code>(x,y)</code> point, which is a single share. Remember that we set our threshold to 3 and that 3 points define a parabola (polynomial of degree 2) perfectly. That means that if we use three points, we can draw a parabola and calculate a0 (the secret). Let’s assume we have control of shares 1, 2, and 4.</p>
<h3>Step 1 – Plot the points (shares) that we control</h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="498" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1024x498.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing no line" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-300x146.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-768x374.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line-150x73.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-no-line.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing no line"></figure></div>
<h3>Step 2 – Draw the corresponding parabola </h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="540" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-300x158.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-768x405.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-1536x810.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-150x79.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing"></figure></div>
<h3>Step 3 – Find the point where <code>x=0</code>. It’s <code>y</code> value is the secret</h3>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="555" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg" alt="shamirs secret sharing shares" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-300x162.jpg 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-768x416.jpg 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-1536x832.jpg 1536w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares-150x81.jpg 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shamirs-secret-sharing-shares.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="shamirs secret sharing shares"></figure></div>
<p>In our case, the secret is <code>1954</code>.</p>
<h2>It’s not actually that simple. We need finite fields.</h2>
<p>While the example we worked through above is great for demonstration purposes, it actually isn’t very secure. For each share that an attacker obtains, they actually are gaining more and more information about the secret. While two points don’t perfectly describe a parabola, they still leak critical information <em>about</em> the parabola.</p>
<p>The solution lies in <a aria-label="finite field arithmetic (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">finite field arithmetic</a>. By plotting the function on a finite field of sufficient size, the graph of the polynomial becomes disjointed and scattered, which means the attacker is unable to make educated guesses about the pathing of the underlying function.</p>
<h2>Adi Shamir</h2>
<p>Adi Shamir is an Israeli cryptographer famous for Shamir’s Secret Sharing, but he is also a co-inventor of the widely used RSA algorithm that the vast majority of the internet is built upon. Shamir was born in&nbsp;Tel Aviv and earned an undergraduate degree<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" rel="noopener"> </a>in&nbsp;math&nbsp;from the university there. Later he obtained his master’s and Ph.D. degrees in&nbsp;Computer Science&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Weizmann Institute&nbsp;in 1975 and 1977 respectively.</p>

December 14, 2020 | https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/">archive.org</a>

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail

    case "${1-}" in

<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

December 14, 2020 | https://www.speechly.com/blog/real-time-voice-user-interfaces/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.speechly.com/blog/real-time-voice-user-interfaces/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2>What’s wrong with current voice UIs</h2><p>There is a lot of positive momentum around <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/what-is-voice-user-interface/">voice interfaces</a>. We’ve all seen the stats: the number of smart speakers in US households has risen steadily for the past five years. The share of <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-search/">voice searches</a> of all search engine traffic has soared. Yet, the type of revolution that the touch screen gave birth to, after the launch of the iPhone, hasn’t really happened for voice — despite all the hype. Why is that?</p><p>Anyone who has a bit of experience from using voice interfaces knows that you can do simple things like setting on the alarm, switching on the lights, or playing your favorite music on Spotify pretty easily. However, if you try to do anything more sophisticated, say, <a href="https://www.speechly.com/use-cases/fast-food-ordering/">order pizza</a> for your eight best friends, reserve an intercontinental flight for a family of five, or buy a new party dress online, the chances are that you're going to fail miserably. For more demanding and for most real-world tasks, the user experience with voice just isn’t there yet — at least as it is for the touch screen.</p><p>Still, contrary to what people might think, the problem is not really anymore in speech recognition or natural language understanding accuracy. Even for fairly open-ended domains, both speech recognition and natural language understanding accuracy is pretty close to human parity.</p><p>The problem lies rather in the way these systems give feedback to the user. Typically, when a voice command is uttered, the modern <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/why-smart-speakers-are-not-the-future-of-voice/">voice assistants</a> wait until the user has stopped talking (using the technique called endpointing) before they start processing it. This works great for short things like “turn on the lights” or “Play X on Spotify”. However, for more complex tasks this is a disaster.</p><p>Imagine if you need to express something that requires a longer explanation. When looking for a new t-shirt, a person might be tempted to say something like “I’m interested in t-shirts for men ...in color red, blue or orange, let’s say Boss ...no wait, I mean Hilfiger ...maybe size medium or large ...and something that’s on sale and can be shipped by tomorrow ...and I’d like to see the cheapest options first.”</p><p>When uttering something this long and winding to a traditional voice UI, most likely something will go wrong, resulting in the familiar, “Sorry, I didn’t quite get that.” Having just made the extended effort of explaining your intent to the system, this is an extremely frustrating experience. Or even worse, the endpointing might trigger a false positive half way the utterance, causing the voice assistant to prematurely resolve the intent and start a voice synthesis response, interrupting the speaker violently and irritatingly.</p><p>In the following sections of this article, we will introduce the powerful techniques of streaming spoken language understanding and reactive <a href="https://www.speechly.com/blog/voice-application-design-guide/">multi-modal voice user interfaces</a> that address the very problem the current generation of voice UIs suffer from.</p><h2>Streaming Spoken Language Understanding</h2><p>Contrary to the traditional voice systems that rely on endpointing to trigger a response, the systems using streaming spoken language understanding actively try to comprehend the user intent from the very moment the user starts to talk. The idea is that as soon as the user says something actionable, the UI is able to instantly react to it.</p><p>The benefit here is that if the system does not understand the user, the UI will instantly signal this back. This way the UI will fail fast but also recover quickly as the user can immediately stop, correct, and continue. On the other hand, if the system does understand the user, also this information is conveyed immediately. This gives reassurance to the user that their message is going through, and that they can continue their expression. As long as the system understands, the user can just go on and on, which results in longer and more complex utterances that are supported.</p><p>Moreover, the immediate feedback from both the small failures and successes of the UI can be combined in a way that the users can correct either themselves or the UI in an online manner, e.g., “I’m interested in Boss, no, I mean Tommy Hilfiger”. This ushers a way for the UI to not only support more sophisticated and complex UI workflows but also a more stream-of-consciousness way of expressing the users’ intent. This is more natural for humans and requires much less effort than the very specific way that the current voice UIs require the utterances to be given.</p><h2>Reactive and non interruptive multi-modal voice user interfaces</h2><p>The most prominent feedback modality of the current day voice interfaces is voice synthesis. As a feedback mechanism, however, this works poorly as any ongoing user utterance will be abruptly interrupted — a problem exhibited commonly in the contemporary voice UIs. As a feedback mechanism, voice is also a pretty narrow band. Instead, the feedback should be given with a non-interruptive modality. Such modalities include haptic, non-linguistic auditory, and perhaps most naturally and expressively, visual feedback. Using these modalities, the UI can react fast and without interruption to the user. For instance, in the case of “I’m interested in t-shirts,” the UI would swiftly show the most popular t-shirt products, instantly enabling the user to continue with a refining utterance, ”do you have Boss.” This narrows further down the displayed products to show only the Boss branded t-shirts.</p><p>This iteration loop reminisces a familiar setting to everybody: human face-to-face communication, which is, in effect, a reactive, multimodal communication setup. In fact, it is a common misperception that human face-to-face conversation is primarily turn-based (or half-duplex) in a similar fashion that chatbots or voice assistance are. Meaning, first I say something, then you say something, then I say something again, and so on. Not exclusively. The human face-to-face conversation is very much full-duplex: as one person talks, the listener gives feedback with nods, facial expressions, gestures, and interjections like aha and mhm. Furthermore, if the person listening doesn't understand what is being said, they are likely to start making more or less subtle facial expressions to signal their lack of comprehension. This is the tight full-duplex feedback loop that makes human face-to-face communication so efficient. The same efficiency is exhibited in the reactive multi-modal voice user computer interfaces!</p><h2>Voice is not the UI, voice is a modality!</h2><p>At the height of the voice assistant hype ushered in by Amazon Alexa, many probably heard the flying phrase “Voice is the UI!”. This article disagrees. Voice is a modality! By augmenting a UI with voice in combination with other available modalities, the result can be an extremely efficient UI.</p><blockquote><p>The perfect interface is when you can use touch and voice seamlessly and choose the best option for the context, sometimes interchangeably</p></blockquote><p>This efficiency comes from how the modalities work together, not from voice alone. Voice is, for instance, a very efficient method for <a href="https://www.speechly.com/design/">inputting rich information</a>. For scrolling, swiping, pointing, or selecting between a couple of valid alternatives, touch is probably better. For displaying complex multidimensional information, the visual display is unbeatable. Combining all of these modalities in a smart way is the killer app.</p><h2>What was the revolutionary thing in the iPhone?</h2><p>Circling back to where we started, the iPhone moment. What made the iPhone so powerful? Well, the very intuitive swipe and pinch gestures with which the user could effortlessly control their phone. However, when the iPhone came out, the touch screen wasn't a new thing. There had been prior touch screen devices. They just sucked! You could swipe or press, and a second or two later something would happen.</p><p>What the iPhone brought to the mix was the extremely fast feedback that its touch screen could provide to the user, resulting in the very intuitive, fluid, and satisfying user experience of controlling your phone. Voice UIs based on streaming spoken language understanding are a similar type of revolution. The streaming spoken language understanding offers extremely fast, fluid, and intuitive feedback to the user akin to what the iPhone brought to the controlling devices back in 2007. However — this time, voice is in the center, providing user experiences that we haven’t seen before, ushering the iPhone moment at last for voice as well.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Why I Quit a $500K Job at Amazon to Work for Myself</h2>



<p>Last week I left my cushy job at Amazon after 8 years. Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year.</p>



<p>I spent my entire time in AWS building tools for developers. I liked that field so much that I would have been satisfied working in it for the rest of my life.</p>



<p>I joined Amazon as an entry level developer. Within 3.5 years I had been promoted twice to a senior engineer, and I was practically guaranteed another promotion to principal engineer this year if I had stayed. My potential at the company was high, I was told.</p>



<p>My esteem within the company grew along the years and I was regarded an expert and a leader in my field. People looked up to me and respected me.</p>



<p>I made $75K in my first year and that gradually grew to $511K by my last year. I could have made another $1M if I stayed another couple of years.</p>



<p>My work–life balance was good too, despite Amazon’s reputation. I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, and I could get everything done in 40 hours a week. My team worked from home one day a week, and I rarely opened my laptop at night or weekends.</p>



<p>Also, the people I worked with were exceptional. I had three managers in total, and all were generous people with lots of empathy. I’m very grateful to everyone I worked with.</p>



<p>Everything was going well and getting better. But despite all this, my motivation to go to work each morning was decreasing—almost in an inverse trend to my career and income growth.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Rewards up, motivation down." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?resize=1100%2C619&amp;ssl=1 1100w, https://i0.wp.com/danielvassallo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rewards_motivation-2340812862-1549830899929.png?w=1801&amp;ssl=1 1801w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Rewards up, motivation down.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would have been foolish of me to expect my motivation to start increasing if I got yet another promotion, or another compensation bump, or another big project. But there was something else that was trending down with my motivation. It was my freedom.</p>



<h3>The Motivation Decline</h3>



<p>For the first couple of years my motivation was off the charts. I was mostly working with another person on an internal tool, and there was very little scrutiny around it. It was a time where I had a lot of independence in choosing how to work and what to work on—at least relative to more recent years.  It was just me and the other person improving this thing, talking to users, releasing updates, testing it, and everything else. Whatever we felt was important, we generally got to do. We did the best work we could for its own sake and we were mostly self-directed.</p>



<p>The last couple of years, however, were quite different. I was leading the most important project in the history of my department, with many stakeholders and complex goals. What I could do was always bounded by my ability to convince all the people involved that it was the best way to navigate our goals. </p>



<p>I was always going to be working on somebody else’s terms at Amazon. The terms were simple in the beginning (keep fixing the thing), but kept getting more complicated as the years passed by (maximize all goals; satisfy all stakeholders). Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.</p>



<h3 id="mce_19">Finding New Motivation</h3>



<p>What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious? I don’t think so. Because there are two types of drivers that get me out of bed in the morning.</p>



<p>One comes from the outside in the form of a carrot or a stick. For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.</p>



<p>The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.</p>



<p>Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.</p>



<p>The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.</p>



<h3>What’s Next?</h3>



<p>I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?</p>

    <h5>Posted on December 14, 2020</h5>
    

    <p><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a> is a new project aiming at making a UI toolkit.
            The <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/introducing-sixtyfps.html">previous blog post</a> was introducing the project.
            This blog post explains, through a small tutorial, how to use SixtyFPS to create a small game.
        </p>

    <p>
        In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to create a simple memory puzzle game with SixtyFPS.
        We are going to combine the
        <code>.60</code> language for the graphics with the game rules implemented in the Rust programming language.
        The SixtyFPS framework also supports other programming languages like <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/cpp/readme">C++</a> or <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/node/">JavaScript</a>.
        Update: we also published <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/%3Ca%20href=" ..="" blog="" memory-game-tutorial-cpp.html"="">"&gt;a C++ version of this tutorial</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The game consists of a grid of 16 rectangular tiles. When clicking on a tile, an icon underneath is uncovered.
        We know that there are 8 different icons in total, so each tile has a sibling somewhere in the grid with the
        same icon. The objective is to locate all icon pairs. Only two tiles can be uncovered at the same time. If they
        are not the same, then the icons will be obscured again. We need to remember under which tiles the matching
        graphics are hiding. If two tiles with the same icon are uncovered, then they remain visible - they are solved.
    </p>

<p> This is how the game looks like in action:</p>


<p>You can also <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/demos/memory/" target="_blank">play in your web browser</a>.
</p>

    <h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>

    <p>We assume that you are a somewhat familiar with Rust, and that you know how to create a Rust application with
        <code>cargo new</code>. The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust Getting Started Guide"</a>
        can help you get set up.</p>


        <p>First, we create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code>cargo new memory
cd memory</code></pre>

        <p>Then we edit <code>Cargo.toml</code> to add the sixtyfps dependency:</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
</code></pre>

    <p>Finally we copy the hello world program from the <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/">SixtyFPS
            documentation</a> into our <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{
    MainWindow := Window {
        Text {
            text: "hello world";
            color: green;
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    MainWindow::new().run();
}
</code></pre>



    <h3 id="memory-tile">Memory Tile</h3>


    <p>
        With the skeleton in place, let's look at the first element of the game, the memory tile. It will be the
        visual building block that consists of an underlying filled rectangle background, the icon image. Later we'll add a
        covering rectangle that acts as a curtain. The background rectangle is declared to be 64 logical pixels wide and tall,
        and it is filled with a soothing tone of blue. Note how lengths in the <code>.60</code> language have a unit, here
        the <code>px</code> suffix. That makes the code easier to read and the compiler can detect when your're accidentally
        mixing values with different units attached to them.
    </p>

    <p>We copy the following code inside of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    width: 64px;
    height: 64px;
    color: #3960D5;

    Image {
        source: img!"icons/bus.png";
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }
}

MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Inside the <code>Rectangle</code> we place an <code>Image</code>
    element that loads an icon with the <code>img!</code> directive. The path is
    relative to the folder in which the <code>Cargo.toml</code> is located. This icon and others we're going to
    use later need to be installed first. You can download a <a href="https://sixtyfps.io//blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip">Zip
        archive</a> that we have prepared and
    extract it with the following two commands:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O https://sixtyfps.io/blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip
unzip icons.zip</code></pre>

<p>
    This should unpack an <code>icons</code> directory containing a bunch of icons.
</p>



    <h3 id="memory-tiles">Polishing the Tile</h3>

    <p>
        Next, let's add a curtain like cover that opens up when clicking. We achieve this by declaring two rectangles
        below the <code>Image</code>, so that they are drawn afterwards and thus on top of the image.
        The <code>TouchArea</code> element declares a transparent rectangular region that allows
        reacting to user input such as a mouse click or tap. We use that to forward a signal to the <em>MainWindow</em>
        that the tile was clicked on. In the <em>MainWindow</em> we react by flipping a custom <em>open_curtain</em> property.
        That in turn is used in property bindings for the animated width and x properties. Let's look at the two states a bit
        more in detail:
    </p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col"><em>open_curtain</em> value:</th>
                <th scope="col">false</th>
                <th scope="col">true</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Left curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the left half by setting the width <em>width</em> to half the parent's width</td>
                <td>Width of zero makes the rectangle invisible</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Right curtain rectangle</th>
                <td>Fill the right half by setting <em>x</em> and <em>width</em> to half of the parent's width</td>
                <td><em>width</em> of zero makes the rectangle invisible. <em>x</em> is moved to the right,
                    to slide the curtain open when animated</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <p>In order to make our tile extensible, the hard-coded icon name is replaced with an <em>icon</em>
        property that can be set from the outside when instantiating the element. For the final polish, we add a
        <em>solved</em> property that we use to animate the color to a shade of green when we've found a pair, later. We
        replace the code inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following:</p>

    <pre><code>MemoryTile := Rectangle {
    signal clicked;
    property &lt;bool&gt; open_curtain;
    property &lt;bool&gt; solved;
    property &lt;resource&gt; icon;

    height: 64px;
    width: 64px;
    color: solved ? #34CE57 : #3960D5;
    animate color { duration: 800ms; }

    
    Image {
        source: icon;
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
    }

    // Left curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    // Right curtain
    Rectangle {
        color: #193076;
        x: open_curtain ? parent.width : (parent.width / 2);
        width: open_curtain ? 0px : (parent.width / 2);
        height: parent.height;
        animate width { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
        animate x { duration: 250ms; easing: ease-in; }
    }

    TouchArea {
        clicked =&gt; {
            // Delegate to the user of this element
            root.clicked();
        }
    }
}
MainWindow := Window {
    MemoryTile {
        icon: img!"icons/bus.png";
        clicked =&gt; {
            self.open_curtain = !self.open_curtain;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of <code>root</code> and <code>self</code> in the code. <code>root</code> refers to the outermost
    element in the component, that's the <code>MemoryTile</code> in this case. <code>self</code> refers
    to the current element.</p>



    <h3>From One To Multiple Tiles</h3>


    <p>
        After modeling a single tile, let's create a grid of them. For the grid to be our game board, we need two features:
    
    </p><ol>
        <li>A data model: This shall be an array where each element describes the tile data structure, such as the
            url of the image, whether the image shall be visible and if this tile has been solved. We modify the model
            from Rust code.</li>
        <li>A way of creating many instances of the tiles, with the above <code>.60</code> markup code.</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <p>
        In SixtyFPS we can declare an array of structures using brackets, to create a model. We can use the <code>for</code> loop to create many instances of the same element. In <code>.60</code> the
        for loop is declarative and automatically updates when the model changes. We instantiate all the different
        <code>MemoryTile</code> elements and place them on a grid based on their index with a
        little bit of spacing between the tiles.
    </p>
    
    <p>First, we copy the tile data structure definition and paste it at top inside the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro:</p>

    <pre><code>sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{

// Added:
struct TileData := {
    image: resource,
    image_visible: bool,
    solved: bool,
}

MemoryTile := Rectangle {
// ...
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Next, we replace the <em><code>MainWindow</code> := { ... }</em> section
        at the bottom of the <code>sixtyfps!</code> macro with the following snippet:</p>

    <pre>        <code>MainWindow := Window {
    width: 326px;
    height: 326px;

    property &lt;[TileData]&gt; memory_tiles: [
       { image: img!"icons/at.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/balance-scale.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bicycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/bus.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cloud.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/cogs.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/motorcycle.png" },
       { image: img!"icons/video.png" },
    ];
    for tile[i] in memory_tiles : MemoryTile {
        x: mod(i, 4) * 74px;
        y: floor(i / 4) * 74px;
        width: 64px;
        height: 64px;
        icon: tile.image;
        open_curtain: tile.image_visible || tile.solved;
        // propagate the solved status from the model to the tile
        solved: tile.solved;
        clicked =&gt; {
            tile.image_visible = !tile.image_visible;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
 The <code><span>for</span> tile[i] <span>in memory_tiles :</span></code> syntax
        declares a variable <code>tile</code> which contains the data of one element from the <code>memory_tiles</code> array,
        and a variable <code>i</code> which is the index of the tile. We use the <code>i</code> index to calculate the position
        of tile based on its row and column, using the modulo and integer division to create a 4 by 4 grid.
        </p>



<h3>Creating The Tiles From Rust</h3>

<p>The tiles in the game should have a random placement. We'll need to add the <code>rand</code> dependency to
    <code>Cargo.toml</code> for the randomization.</p>

<pre><code>[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "0.0.4"
rand = "0.7" # Added
</code></pre>

<p>What we'll do is take the list of tiles declared in the .60 language, duplicate it, and shuffle it.
    We'll do so by accessing the <code>memory_tiles</code> property through the Rust code. For each
top-level property, a getter and a setter function is generated - in our case <code>get_memory_tiles</code>
and <code>set_memory_tiles</code>. Since <code>memory_tiles</code> is an array in the .60
language, it is represented as a
<code>Rc&lt;dyn <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/trait.model">sixtyfps::Model</a>&gt;</code>.
We can't modify the model generated by the .60, but we can extract the tiles from it, and put it
in a <code><a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.vecmodel">VecModel</a></code> which
implements the <code>Model</code> trait. <code>VecModel</code> allows us to make modifications and we
can use it to replace the static generated model.
<br>
We modify the main …</p></div></section></div></div>

December 14, 2020 | https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The overwhelming majority of people do not seem to care about privacy. They ask why they should care if they have “nothing to hide”. Yet this idea of hiding is fundamentally flawed.</p>

<p>The United Nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy" rel="nofollow">state</a> that privacy is a human right, just like the right to education is. So why on earth would you give that up? The famous (and somewhat obligatory) quote from Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question about privacy is not about hiding, it is about sharing. It is not that I have nothing to hide, I just do not have anything I want to share, especially unknowingly.&nbsp;This whole narrative that privacy is only for nefarious people is pushed by those who quite clearly care alot about privacy. Mark Zuckerberg spent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-neighbouring-houses" rel="nofollow">tens of millions of dollars</a> buying the houses that surrounded his home, for example. The irony is painful.</p>

<p>We all care about our privacy, though we might not know it. It is why we lock the door when we go to the toilet; or why we close the curtains to stop people looking into our homes.</p>

<p>In her essay for Aeon Magazine, Carissa Véliz <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-us-all" rel="nofollow">argued</a> that privacy is power. It is the power “to show you ads... and to predict your behaviour”. But it is also the power to influence. Increasingly, Big Tech, the likes of Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, are sharing more and more information with governments. In turn, governments are starting to learn more and more about their citizens. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun – and this is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy to be normal – and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being judged by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, however. We paved the path for Big Tech, though we no longer have to follow it. If we change our actions then a lot can be achieved. In most instances, alternatives to mainstream products, such as Google, are available. <a href="https://privacytools.io/" rel="nofollow">PrivacyTools.io</a> is a website, for which I am a team member, designed to showcase tools and knowledge to protect your privacy, along with housing a wonderful community of like minded privacy advocates. By simply switching to a few of the recommended services and installing some of the recommended add-ons we can slowly reverse the damage that was done. Furthermore, if you live in the EU, you can use your rights under GDPR to ensure all data that companies have on you is erased.</p>

<p>Privacy matters, regardless of who you are. We seriously need to start protecting it.</p>

<h3 id="nav_umstrittene__0">Umstrittene HintertÃ¼ren und GeneralschlÃ¼ssel</h3>
<p>Kernpunkt der <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-13084-2020-REV-1/en/pdf" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">endgÃ¼ltigen Version vom 24. November</a> ist der Gedanke, dass fÃ¼r SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden eine Form des auÃŸergewÃ¶hnlichen Zugriffs auf verschlÃ¼sselte Daten im Klartext mÃ¶glich sein sollte und kÃ¶nnte. Diese Idee haben unter anderem Geheimdienste wie die NSA und das GCHQ Ã¼ber den sogenannten Five-Eyes-Verbund sowie das FBI <a href="https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Missing-Link-Crypto-Wars-der-endlose-Streit-ueber-sichere-Verschluesselung-4967574.html">in den laufenden Crypto Wars</a> propagiert.</p>
<p>Grundlegende SicherheitsmÃ¤ngel fÃ¼r alle anderen Nutzer eines Dienstes oder einer Technologie sollen laut der seit Jahren gefÃ¼hrten Debatte Ã¼ber Vorder- und HintertÃ¼ren sowie Universal- oder NachschlÃ¼ssel nach offizieller Lesart nicht geschaffen werden. Techniker verweisen eine solche "magische LÃ¶sung" aber ins Reich der MÃ¤rchen, da es "ein bisschen verschlÃ¼sselt" nicht gibt.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/86789/tag"></a-script>
  


<h3 id="nav_gesellschaft__1">Gesellschaft und BÃ¼rger "auch online schÃ¼tzen"</h3>
<p>Der Rat will nun trotzdem <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Deutsche-EU-Ratspraesidentschaft-will-Beihilfe-zur-Entschluesselung-4940927.html">auf die Beihilfe von Dienstanbietern wie Apple, Facebook, Google, Threema, Signal oder WhatsApp beim EntschlÃ¼sseln elektronischer Kommunikation</a> setzen. "VerschlÃ¼sselung ist ein notwendiges Mittel zum Schutz der Grundrechte und der digitalen Sicherheit von Regierungen, Industrie und Gesellschaft", <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/de/press/press-releases/2020/12/14/encryption-council-adopts-resolution-on-security-through-encryption-and-security-despite-encryption/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">heiÃŸt es in der EntschlieÃŸung</a>. Gleichzeitig mÃ¼sse die EU aber sicherstellen, dass die "zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden im Bereich Sicherheit und Strafjustiz" â€“ inklusive Geheimdiensten â€“ ihre "gesetzlichen Befugnisse" ausÃ¼ben und "sowohl online als auch offline unsere Gesellschaften" und BÃ¼rger schÃ¼tzen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

  
    <a-script name="488" needs-consent="" src="https://widgets.opinary.com/embed.js"></a-script>
  





<p>Diese ZwiespÃ¤ltigkeit, die schon im Titel der Resolution angelegt ist, zieht sich durch das ganze Dokument. "Ganz offensichtlich kommen VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien allen Seiten zugute", meinen die Regierungsvertreter. "Es werden nicht nur elektronische GerÃ¤te und Anwendungen zunehmend so programmiert, dass sie gespeicherte Nutzerdaten standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sseln". Auch immer mehr KommunikationskanÃ¤le und Datenspeicherdienste wÃ¼rden durch Ende-zu-Ende-VerschlÃ¼sselung gesichert.</p>






  


  <a-ad height="250" instant="" layout="responsive" media="(min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 767px)" preload-distance="200" safeframe="" sizes="300x50,300x75,300x100,300x150,300x250,320x50,320x75,320x100,320x250,fluid" targeting="{&quot;kw&quot;:[&quot;Crypto Wars&quot;,&quot;Datenschutz&quot;,&quot;EU&quot;,&quot;Sicherheit&quot;,&quot;Trojaner&quot;,&quot;VerschlÃ¼sselung&quot;],&quot;mpos&quot;:[&quot;2&quot;],&quot;themenhub&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}" type="gpt" unit="/6514/www.heise.de/newsticker/news-internet" width="300"></a-ad>



<h3 id="nav__quot_rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig__2">"RechtmÃ¤ÃŸiger Zugang" fÃ¼r BehÃ¶rden per Gesetz nÃ¶tig</h3>
<p>Die Digitalisierung moderner Gesellschaften bringt laut der Deklaration aber auch "gewisse Schwachstellen und das Potenzial einer Ausbeutung fÃ¼r kriminelle Zwecke mit sich". So kÃ¶nnten StraftÃ¤ter "leicht zugÃ¤ngliche, herkÃ¶mmliche VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen, die fÃ¼r rechtmÃ¤ÃŸige Zwecke konzipiert sind, fÃ¼r ihre Vorgehensweisen nutzen". Gleichzeitig hÃ¤nge die Strafverfolgung zunehmend vom Zugang zu elektronischen Beweismitteln ab, um Terrorismus, organisierte KriminalitÃ¤t, sexuellen Missbrauch von Kindern sowie eine Vielzahl anderer Cyberstraftaten wirksam zu bekÃ¤mpfen.</p>
<p>UnabhÃ¤ngig vom derzeitigen technologischen Umfeld ist es dem Rat zufolge daher unerlÃ¤sslich, die Befugnisse der zustÃ¤ndigen BehÃ¶rden "durch rechtmÃ¤ÃŸigen Zugang zu wahren". NÃ¶tig seien gegebenenfalls Gesetze, mit denen diese auf dem Papier schon bestehenden Kompetenzen auch praktisch durchgesetzt werden kÃ¶nnten. Diese mÃ¼ssten "im vollen Einklang mit einem ordnungsgemÃ¤ÃŸen Verfahren und anderen Garantien sowie den Grundrechten stehen". Die unterschiedlichen Interessen seien sorgfÃ¤ltig abzuwÃ¤gen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_einheitliche__3">Einheitliche technische LÃ¶sung wohl nicht machbar</h3>
<p>Die EU zeigt sich laut der ErklÃ¤rung nun bestrebt, "in einen aktiven Dialog mit der Technologiebranche einzutreten und dabei Forschung und Wissenschaft einzubeziehen". Dabei gelte es, einerseits den Einsatz starker VerschlÃ¼sselungstechnologien und die Cybersicherheit zu gewÃ¤hrleisten. Andererseits mÃ¼ssten SicherheitsbehÃ¶rden "unter uneingeschrÃ¤nkter Achtung der Grundrechte und der einschlÃ¤gigen Datenschutzgesetze rechtmÃ¤ÃŸig und gezielt auf Daten zugreifen kÃ¶nnen". DafÃ¼r seien grundrechtskompatible "technische LÃ¶sungen" nÃ¶tig.</p>
<p>Vage wird in dem Papier festgehalten, dass die Notwendigkeit, einen entsprechenden EU-weiten Regelungsrahmen zu entwickeln, weiter bewertet werden "kÃ¶nnte". Dies soll offenbar nahelegen, dass eine zusÃ¤tzliche Analyse nicht mehr zwingend fÃ¼r kÃ¼nftige gesetzgeberische Schritte nÃ¶tig ist. Es sei vor allem wichtig, die BemÃ¼hungen aller LÃ¤nder, Organe und Institutionen der EU zu bÃ¼ndeln. Eine "einheitliche vorgeschriebene technische LÃ¶sung fÃ¼r den Zugang zu verschlÃ¼sselten Daten" sieht der Rat aber als nicht machbar an.</p>
<h3 id="nav_kaum__4">Kaum verÃ¤nderter Entwurf trotz Kritik beschlossen</h3>
<p>Die Bundesregierung hatte mit frÃ¼heren EntwÃ¼rfen eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Terrorbekaempfung-und-Verschluesselung-EU-Rat-forciert-umstrittene-Crypto-Linie-4960069.html">Welle der Kritik ausgelÃ¶st</a>, zuletzt aber nur noch Nuancen am Text geÃ¤ndert. Das Innenministerium <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Crypto-Wars-Bundesregierung-verteidigt-EU-Linie-zur-Entschluesselung-4984108.html">verteidigt den Kurs damit</a>, dass der Einsatz von Staatstrojanern zum Umgehen von VerschlÃ¼sselung zu aufwÃ¤ndig und so meist nicht praktikabel sei. Unter anderem die Datenschutzkonferenz von Bund und LÃ¤ndern hatte die Zugriffsforderungen entschieden zurÃ¼ckgewiesen. Die "AushÃ¶hlung von VerschlÃ¼sselungslÃ¶sungen", wie sie der Ratsbeschluss nahelege, sei kontraproduktiv und kÃ¶nnte durch Kriminelle und Terroristen leicht umgangen werden. Die Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Informatik hatte beklagt: Die Initiative gefÃ¤hrde nicht nur die informationelle Selbstbestimmung, sondern auch den Schutz von Betriebs- und GeschÃ¤ftsgeheimnissen.</p>
<p>Die EU-Kommission <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Anti-Terror-Agenda-EU-Kommission-sucht-Mittelweg-gegen-Verschluesselung-4985264.html">hat sich mit ihrer Anti-Terror-Agenda bereits hinter die RatserklÃ¤rung gestellt</a>. Sie will nun vor allem im Kampf gegen die Verbreitung von Missbrauchsdarstellungen <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/EU-Kommission-Mit-Hashabgleich-und-TPM-gegen-Ende-zu-Ende-Verschluesselung-4889729.html">LÃ¶sungen fÃ¼r den Zugang zu Nachrichten im Klartext ausloten</a>, die <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Bundestagsstudie-EU-Vorschlag-zum-Umgehen-von-Verschluesselung-taugt-nicht-4980983.html">IT-Sicherheitsexperten aber bislang als untauglich einschÃ¤tzen</a>. HintertÃ¼ren schlieÃŸt sie bei dem von ihr fÃ¼r mÃ¶glich erachteten "Mittelweg" nicht aus. Europol betreibt schon eine <a href="https://www.heise.de/meldung/Crypto-Wars-Europol-soll-Europas-Ermittlern-bei-Entschluesselung-helfen-3914261.html">Plattform zur EntschlÃ¼sselung</a> nach dem Vorbild der deutschen HackerbehÃ¶rde Zitis.</p>

The answer to this questions should be one that you know, and you can provide with certainty and authentic conviction. Make use of the elevator pitch, excite the investor with an engaging answer that sparks their curiosity to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pwj5nk" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pzojfp" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pw9bdv" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Again, keep your questions short and to the point during investor meetings. This is a great opportunity to explain your motivation as to why you are working on this. Make sure to convey clear reasons and back them up with some domain expertise or background experience that makes you the perfect team to work on this idea. don’t forget to express your enthusiasm and excitement your cary within to be bring this idea to life. Investors like to hear that you are passionate about what you do.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pfrdpb" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p76drh" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pcqqvd" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor likes to know if you can prove that you have a truly unique value proposition. You have been working on this idea for a while now and did your research, you should definitely be able to explain properly how you differ from others in the market. First of all, express how you and your team are different than any other team to execute on this. Explain the in-house expertise, motivation, and amazing team collaboration to achieve results. Second, you found a unique solution to the customer’s problem through innovative (proprietary) technology, product development, or service offering unlike anything in the market today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What big problem do you solve?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p5m277" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p729kq" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pwq1v6" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>When an investor asks you this question, get ready to emphasize clearly that the problem your solving is HUGE! You are on a mission to solve a problem that will change the way people do certain things and it will have a tremendous impact. Make sure to state some short key facts why this true so you’re not just blowing this up. The reason why you want to answer it in this way, is because the bigger the problem, the more likely people are willing to pay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What is unique about the company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pswh74" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt3l1o" data-type="column"> <div data-id="prc0cw" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Although this question ties in closely with “how are you different?” they are not entirely the same question. This is your opportunity to really focus on what makes your company unique. It might be your proprietary innovative technology that makes your company unique. It could be that your team has amazing set of skills unlike any other team. Or, it could be that your company strategized towards problems and opportunities just a bit different than others. Focus, focus, focus – let them know that <i>you know</i> what is unique about your company.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why is your business defensible?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc026o" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pg1ie5" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pf29xp" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor is looking for some reassurance that your business and product/service is not one that will be copied easily. You defensibility could be your go-to-market strategy or scaling strategy. Defensibility could also come from the team you assemble or the technology you are building. Explain how your business is one that can’t be easily copied and executed. Even if the idea can be copied by another company, they will not have the team you have to execute successfully. There is and should always be a clear confident answer to this question.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What do you understand that others don’t?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p4hpcs" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pu9ezu" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pnji6p" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>You certainly did your market research, spoke to customers, or have a background in a certain industry or field that gave you an understanding of the problem or opportunity you are working on.

You’re unique, different, and will do things better. However, this is great moment to give an example of a company you admire (wether in your field or not). It shows that you have a vision for a certain strategy, company culture, or execution. While explaining your likes about the other company, make sure to incorporate some clear examples of what you will adopt and do differently.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Who do you least want to be like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p11f39" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pvu318" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pdd7ly" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Don’t answer this question by badmouthing another company.

If you’re profitable you share an exact figure of profit you made. If you’re not profitable, don’t turn this answer into a defensive statement as to why not. Instead, give a short answer as to when you expect to become profitable and why (letters of intent, speaking with clients that will convert soon etc…). However, do not lie or give vague answers as to when you expect profits. This will only complicate things later and will make you look like you failed when you don’t reach those conversions.

              <p>Developers spend most of their time reading code, understanding it and exploring other ways to use existing solutions. Frankly, in our profession, there is very little time on actually writing new libraries and creating new interfaces in real-life development. So it is quite important to have some help in the most common activities. <strong>Naming conventions</strong> is one such thing that improves readability and eases the usage cost if agreed upon and spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Some languages have their own special naming conventions that make sense. Haskell is among them. There are a bunch of naming patterns that are commonly used everywhere in the ecosystem (including the standard libraries) that may help you to recognise the function’s meaning without looking at its documentation and even its type! This ability is especially relevant because naming is one of the hardest development problems, so having some help and no-brainer rules to guide in this area improves everyone’s life.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore common naming conventions in Haskell together. It is going to be useful for both creators (library and API developers) and consumers (library users), as it establishes norms accepted in the libraries’ APIs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🦋 If you are interested in other conventions and best practices on how to write Haskell code, you can take a look at our <a href="https://kowainik.github.io/posts/2019-02-06-style-guide">style guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="checked">Checked<a href="#checked">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with the conventional and straightforward norms established in Haskell’s specifications and standards. Names in Haskell must satisfy the following simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types and typeclasses</strong> must start with an <em>uppercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Functions and variables</strong> must start with a <em>lowercase</em> letter</li>
<li><strong>Top-level operator functions</strong> must start with any allowed symbol except for <code>:</code></li>
<li><strong>Constructors as operators</strong> must start with <code>:</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are in the specifications and therefore checked by the compiler. So if you try to break the naming rules, you will get errors during the compilation.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions follow the <strong>lowerCamelCase</strong> style and types follow the <strong>UpperCamelCase</strong> style. This is the de facto standard of writing code in Haskell, but using distinct styles doesn’t lead to a compiler error. Moreover, there are some testing libraries that use <em>snake_case </em>to discover tests automatically. However, you can restrict that with the Haskell tooling, e.g.&nbsp;HLint can check this for you.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are various details in the names that will give you hints on what the function does. We will walk through them to learn to recognise them all.</p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables<a href="#type-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start our excursions with the type variables that are most commonly used in type signatures and definitions. Some variables represent particular meaning: it could be a typeclass-related convention or just a convenient shorter usage. But in any way, this information is useful to know while reading and writing types:</p>
<div>
<p><code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, …</p>
<div>
<p>Ordinary type variables with no particular meaning</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>map</span><span> ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>f</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Functor</code> or <code>Applicative</code></p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>fmap</span><span> ::</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>m</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Monad</code> or <code>Semigroup</code>/<code>Monoid</code></p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m b) <span>-&gt;</span> m b</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>(&lt;&gt;) ::</span> <span>Semigroup</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>e</code></p>
<div>
<p>Types representing errors</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>failures ::</span> [<span>Validation</span> e a] <span>-&gt;</span> [e]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>t</code></p>
<div>
<p><code>Foldable</code> or <code>Traversable</code></p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>concat</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> t [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>or types of kind <code>Type</code> (previously <code>*</code>)</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> (<span>t ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>Size</span> <span>Int</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>k</code></p>
<div>
<p>Kind</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>family</span> (<span>++</span>) (<span>xs ::</span> [k]) (<span>ys ::</span> [k])<span> ::</span> [k]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="function-variables">Function variables<a href="#function-variables">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The way we name arguments and variables in functions is also not accidental. They contain hints that make reading these variables used in function bodies easier. Variables in functions use the following established commonly used names:</p>
<div>
<p><code>l</code></p>
<p>Lists variable</p>
<p><code>(x:xs)</code> or <code>(y:ys)</code></p>
<div>
<p>Patterns for lists where <code>x</code> means a single x and <code>xs</code> means <em>many <code>x</code>s</em></p>
<p>Also used together with the previous one with as-patterns:</p>

</div>
<p><code>f</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code></p>
<div>
<p>Function arguments</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>map</span> f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> <span>map</span> f xs</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>p</code></p>
<div>
<p>Functions which are predicates (e.g.&nbsp;of type <code>Int -&gt; Bool</code>)</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>bar ::</span> (<span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">bar p i <span>=</span> <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p><code>n</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code></p>
<p>Miscellaneous counters</p>
<p><code>len</code></p>
<p>Container size</p>
<p><code>go</code></p>

</div>
<h2 id="suffixes">Suffixes<a href="#suffixes">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Suffix in a Haskell function can contain a lot of information about its purpose. Sometimes you would see multiple different suffixes simultaneously that combine the characteristics of each piece, so it is helpful to pay attention to that.</p>
<h4 id="apostrophe">Apostrophe ’<a href="#apostrophe">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The <code>'</code> symbol is used in the functions, for which there is a corresponding function without the apostrophe, e.g.&nbsp;<code>foo</code> and <code>foo'</code>.</p>
<p>The apostrophe at the end means that it’s a <strong>strict</strong> version of a similar function. Both functions must have the same type, but different implementations underneath. The only difference in their behaviour is that the one with the <code>'</code> symbol evaluates intermediate results more eagerly.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>foldMap</span><span>  ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>foldMap' ::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> t, <span>Monoid</span> m) <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> m</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, both functions have the same type. But <code>foldMap'</code> is more efficient and helps to avoid space leaks when monoidal operation <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is strict in both arguments.</p>
<h3 id="typeclasses">Typeclasses<a href="#typeclasses">🔗</a></h3>
<p>There is a group of symbols that is used to indicate that the function returns the value in some context. This suffix – an uppercase letter or word – tells us the typeclass this context should represent.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>FAM</code>ily 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦</p>
<h4 id="f">F<a href="#f">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>F</code> suggests that it works with <code>Functor</code>s in some way.</p>
<p>Such functions can have an alternative without the suffix <code>F</code>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers">containers</a> library:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">alter</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb12-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb12-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">alterF</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span>    ::</span> (<span>Functor</span> f, <span>Ord</span> k)</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (<span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Maybe</span> a))</span>
<span id="cb13-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> k</span>
<span id="cb13-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Map</span> k a</span>
<span id="cb13-6">    <span>-&gt;</span> f (<span>Map</span> k a)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, sometimes the suffix <code>F</code> has an alternative meaning. <code>F</code> frequently used as a suffix in formatting libraries to indicate that a function is a <em>formatter</em> or a <em>pretty-printer</em>.</p>
<p>Example from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt">fmt</a> library:</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>timeF ::</span> <span>FormatTime</span> a <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>BuilderSource</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see how the same naming can have different meanings. What’s important is that the library establishes its naming convention explicitly and uses it consistently.</p>
<h4 id="a">A<a href="#a">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>A</code> means that the function works with some general <code>Applicative</code> type (the type that has the <code>Applicative</code> instance).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>sequenceA</span><span> ::</span> (<span>Traversable</span> t, <span>Applicative</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> t (f a) <span>-&gt;</span> f (t a)</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="m">M<a href="#m">🔗</a></h4>
<p>The suffix <code>M</code> is among the most common ones. It usually means that the function works with the <code>Monad</code>s or in the monadic context.</p>
<p>Similarly to the previous suffixes, functions <em>with</em> <code>M</code> have their counterparts <em>without</em> <code>M</code>:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>filter</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2"></span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>    ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">filterM</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> m</span>
<span id="cb17-3">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span>)</span>
<span id="cb17-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb17-5">    <span>-&gt;</span> m [a]</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Historically, the standard Haskell library <code>base</code> didn’t have <code>Applicative</code> functors, and there weren’t the superclass of Monads. But now the suffix <code>M</code> is also sometimes used with Applicative functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="underscore-_">Underscore _<a href="#underscore-_">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Underscore, as a suffix of functions, also has a special meaning. It gives us a clue that the function works exactly as the one without <code>_</code> but discards the result (returns <code>()</code> instead).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">concurrently</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb18-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb18-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> (a, b)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1">concurrently_</span>
<span id="cb19-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>IO</span> a</span>
<span id="cb19-3">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> b</span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="number">Number<a href="#number">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You can often see the series of functions with the numbers at the end of their names. These groups have the same initial part but differ with the number. Numbers there represent the <strong>number of arguments</strong> each function takes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🔢 The number 1 is not used usually in that meaning as it’s redundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>liftA  ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f</span>
<span id="cb20-2">    <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b)</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>Number 1 has a special meaning of requiring at least one argument to be present in a container:</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>foldr</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span>foldr1</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> a) <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Though, the fact that it works with <code>Foldable</code> is not ideal. There is <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/13573">a proposal</a> to implement a typeclass called <code>Foldable</code> (or <code>Semifoldable</code>) for non-empty types.</p>
<h3 id="lr">L/R<a href="#lr">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The suffixes <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (sometimes <code>l</code> and <code>r</code>) represent the direction of function application or order of traversing a data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ Most of the time, these sibling functions have the same type, but in some functions, certain arguments are reversed for convenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>foldr</span><span> ::</span> <span>Foldable</span> t <span>=&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> t a <span>-&gt;</span> b</span>

<h3 id="byon">By/On<a href="#byon">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Some of the overloaded functions that work with <code>Foldable</code>s or lists have a non-overloaded sibling with the suffix <code>By</code>.</p>
<p>It is often convenient to use these functions together with <code>on</code>, for instance:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1">sortBy (<span>compare</span> <span>`on`</span> <span>fst</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This <code>on</code> pattern is so widely used, so functions also have the suffix <code>On</code>.</p>
<p>Compare these three types:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div id="cb29"><pre><code><span id="cb29-1"><span>sort</span></span>
<span id="cb29-2"><span>    ::</span> <span>Ord</span> a</span>
<span id="cb29-3"></span>
<span id="cb29-4">    <span>=&gt;</span> [a]</span>

                <div>
                    <p><strong>Confusing UI design = Recipe for Disaster</strong> – &nbsp;Setting up 2FA on our PayPal business account was exactly that. Usually most payment providers make 2FA a mandate in the setup process, or, at least asks its users to set it up during sign up itself, but PayPal doesn't. I have no complaints about PayPal's Infosec standards as they have been running a successful bug bounty program on Hackerone and seem to have a very responsive and active security team. </p><h2 id="update">Update</h2><p>We did some more research and found out this problem has been there for more than 2 years now yet no action from PayPal's end – <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth">https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/7teop7/twofactor_auth</a></p><p>We haven't received any response from PayPal yet but have gotten in touch with them regarding the same.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-4.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-4.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-4.png 1525w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Users complaining about the issue on PayPal</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2fa-and-account-compromise">2FA and Account Compromise</h2><p>Setting up 2FA is really critical for account security, and PayPal accounts are no different – naturally, they are a more interesting target for hackers due to the price tag attached to them. Thus, enabling 2FA in the first place would be the most logical step to prevent unauthorized account intrusions and account hacks, as every log in would require a TOTP code from an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or, Authy as part of the 2FA process. However, I found this process really hard due to the confusing documentation on PayPal website. </p><p>The process to setup 2FA on PayPal for account security was by far the most difficult, time consuming and confusing process ever but when we get to it... you can realize how simple it could have actually been. Its the most important step to take to prevent getting your PayPal account hacked or, breached or, compromised. In this post, I have explained the full process and why it was so confusing.</p><p>PayPal's confusing UI design can become a threat to user account security &nbsp;as it makes it harder for users to setup 2FA for their accounts.</p><p>But it was, really... I mean <strong>REALLY</strong> difficult for me to locate their 2FA option. I couldn't spot it anywhere in their UI even after several Google searches about this, nothing showed up – whatever did was either too outdated or, totally useless or, deprecated. </p><p>Confused, I got in touch with their Customer Support who pointed me to their the <strong>Settings </strong>page, and told a <strong>Security </strong>page was located there. But... what? I couldn't find one. Weird, that's how difficult PayPal makes it to simply add an additional layer of security to your account. This made me wonder, why is it so difficult to enable a simple security feature like 2FA on PayPal? I tried everything, every button and navigation links on their Android and iOS apps too but failed to locate the 2FA setup page.</p><p>Utterly disappointed, when I came across <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">this</a> Help Center Article which was disguised in the form of a general FAQ about 2FA but, finally I found that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">magic link</a>! – </p><figure><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete"><div><p>what-is-2-step-verification</p><p><img src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/icon/pp196.png"></p></div></a></figure><p>Well, there's a catch. </p><h2 id="the-catch">The Catch</h2><p>When you are <strong>logged out</strong>, PayPal would show the following 2FA Setup process instructions in their <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/smarthelp/article/-what-is-2-step-verification-faq4057?app=searchAutoComplete">Documentation/Help Guide</a> – </strong></p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 1637w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-out 2FA Setup Guide</figcaption></figure><p>However, when you are <strong>logged in, </strong>the instructions asked you to go to profile page and setup 2FA from there – <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">this</a> is the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">final link</a> that leads to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/profile/loginSecurity">2FA setup process</a>. This is <strong>how simple it could have been, </strong>but confusing documentation on the help pages and equally misleading instructions given by customer support made the process incredibly hard and confusing!</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-2.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-2.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-2.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-2.png 1715w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logged-in Profile Page for 2FA Setup</figcaption></figure><h2 id="steps-to-setup-or-add-2fa-to-your-paypal-account-business-account-users-">Steps to setup or, add 2FA to your PayPal account (Business account users)</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Update</strong> after navigating to <strong>Login and Security</strong> page from PayPal Profile page navigation</li>
<li>After clicking on Update, choose your 2FA option. <strong>Choose Authenticator</strong> which is more secure than mobile phone based 2FA. I prefer <strong>Authy</strong>. PayPal 2FA should work with most TOTP authenticator apps.</li>
<li>Scan the code with your Authenticator app or, manually enter the code</li>
<li>Enter the TOTP code on PayPal website after adding PayPal in the Authenticator app,</li>
<li>You have succesffully added 2FA to your PayPal account. To make it more secure, you can go ahead and add SMS 2FA layer as extra defence too.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Turns out PayPal might have done some UI revamping which effectively resulted in concealing the <strong>Security </strong>page's navigation from Account Settings page. The whole thing was pretty troublesome for me. But now that I was able to setup 2FA back again, I have got back my peace of mind back!</p><h3 id="how-the-paypal-cs-reacted">How the PayPal CS reacted</h3><p>However, for me it was even more disappointing was when even their customer support staff too failed to guide me in this regard – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image-3.png 1600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/11/image-3.png 1737w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>PayPal Customer Support's response</figcaption></figure><h2 id="no-2fa-setup-available-in-paypal-mobile-apps">No 2FA Setup available in PayPal Mobile Apps</h2><p>When I last checked, there was no 2FA setup option in the mobile app UI which is an eye sore. Every major payment provider allows merchants and business users to setup 2FA right from the mobile – but I couldn't find the option in either of the apps – neither Android nor iOS which is bad from a security and accessibility standpoint.</p><h2 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h2><p>PayPal itself isn't insecure but these are what I call – classic business logic errors. The UI is the first step towards making a better application and give an overall good experience to the average consumer. Secondly, I had to face a not-so knowledgeable customer support staff who explained how to <strong>navigate to 2FA setup, </strong>but turns out that's not the actual way. I have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars <em>over</em>paying PayPal fees and this is what I get in terms of value for money or, my ROI, a bad user experience (UX). I'm not blaming anyone – but despite charging so much in fees, PayPal still hasn't been able to provide a proper UI/UX to its clients. There are several pain points in their UI, and nothing much has changed in most critical parts of their web app since the past 10-12 years, only some parts of the UI/UX has been revamped but some <strong>areas </strong>like 2FA setup are harder because of PayPal's extremely clunky and confusing UI.</p><p>If app developers don't design the UI properly, they can unintentionally cause losses on the part of their users – as in this case, a legitimate user couldn't setup 2FA on their account due to a buggy UI. I strongly feel UI and UX form a core part of an Application's security and not just the backend and frontend parts involving code. <strong>The UI features should encourage the user to enable more security features in the app, </strong>but in this case – it was misleading and confusing.</p><h2 id="harder-ui-more-security-issues-effectively">Harder UI = More Security Issues, effectively</h2><p>With harder UI in fine grained applications with varying levels of access controls, it becomes increasingly harder for users to manage account restrictions and security policies. As in this example, the <strong>Security </strong>page was hidden from the view which potentially makes a user account more susceptible to compromise. A better and smooth UI ensures a user is able to setup every security setting to optimal level. </p><p>Harder the UI = More the confusion on the part of the user. This can leave organization accounts open to breaches and evidently a lot of hackers are exploiting misconfigurations in application due to user ignorance.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2><p>The entire process was far more painstaking and confusing, than how simple it should have been on the contrary. Thus, making a more intuitive and proper UI is very important from user security point of view than a confusing feature-loaded loosely designed product. Also, security features like 2FA should be mandated in applications dealing with payments and high value transactions in general. Due to a UI revamp or, refactor, that missed putting into place the Security link in Navigation, users can miss the 2FA setup and for those using weak credentials can end up getting hand – which is how hundreds of thousands of PayPal accounts and Credit Card &nbsp;data aka <strong>Fullz </strong>end up getting hacked and sold on darknet marketplaces.</p><blockquote><em><strong>How we can help?</strong></em></blockquote><blockquote><em><strong><a href="https://savebreach.com/">SaveBreach</a></strong> conducts in-depth security research, bug hunting, and security consultancy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Continuing my search for a better debugging experience for my current projects (zig/c, nixos). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger/">first post</a> resulted in a ton of suggestions and I tried them all.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-tui-again">gdb -tui (again)</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25407161">taviso explained</a> how to use the tui properly. </p>
<p>C-l fixes the display and using <code>gdb -tty $SOME_OTHER_TTY</code> stops it from getting messed up in the first place.</p>
<p>Readline bindings (C-n, C-p etc) work in the command window even while the source window has focus. <code>focus cmd</code> gives focus to the command window so I can use arrow keys again.</p>
<p>C-x A is supposed to toggle the tui but for me just crashes, in both alacritty and xterm. I've <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/106868">reported this against nix</a> for now, since that's the most likely culprit. (EDIT nope, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/106981">it was a gdb bug</a>).</p>
<h2 id="emacs-gdb">emacs gdb</h2>
<p>Many people suggested using <code>gdb</code> and <code>gdb-many-windows</code> instead of <code>gud</code>. </p>
<p>This is much better - I get a clickable thread list, backtrace and locals list.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/emacs.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It displays all my locals as "&lt;complex data type&gt;" which is not super helpful. There is a <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=34589">patch</a> to improve this but it looks like it got delayed by legal issues.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-dap-mode">emacs dap-mode</h2>
<p>For gdb this <a href="https://emacs-lsp.github.io/dap-mode/page/configuration/#native-debug-gdblldb">requires</a> the vscode extension which I couldn't get working in the last post, so I haven't investigated further.</p>
<h2 id="clion-again">clion (again)</h2>
<p>Kaylee Blake emailed me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several of the issues you encountered with CLion are ones I have previously encountered, and thankfully two of them are solvable and one can be worked around. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your variables are (probably) not being displayed because CLion leans on its language support for computing precise start-of-scope for variables (GDB doesn't support this DWARF feature, sadly), but unfortunately defaults to assuming that variables are always out of scope if its language support isn't capable of mapping debug symbols to declarations. (It appears that the Zig plugin doesn't have any debugger integration). As such, you need to click on the gear icon on the left of the debug pane (in your screenshot, hidden behind a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> symbol at the bottom), and uncheck "Hide out-of-scope variables".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the Memory View, you need to right-click on any variable and choose "Show in Memory View", which will actually cause the pane to load. I have no idea why this is required given that the Memory View is perfectly capable of navigating to raw addresses or addresses computed by arbitrary expressions once the pane has loaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You (probably) can't set breakpoints through the UI because the Zig plugin doesn't register the Zig filetype as capable of having breakpoints set on it. There's no way to fix this without writing a plugin, unfortunately, but you can still use the GDB console to set breakpoints. They won't persist between sessions, though, or show up in the UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the fixes worked. I can now see variables and open them in the memory view.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/clion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The memory view doesn't support editing memory, but I can still do that in the gdb console.</p>
<p>I added <code>*actual.items.ptr@100</code> to the watches list and it rendered the whole array perfectly happily.</p>
<p>Setting breakpoints in the gdb console seemed to work at first, but restarting the program to get to the breakpoint doesn't. If I rerun using the button in the debugger, the breakpoints disappear. If I try to restart the program from within gdb, it crashes:</p>
<pre><code><span>(gdb) info breakpoints
No breakpoints or watchpoints.
(gdb) b Tree.searchForwards
Breakpoint 1 at 0x207222: file /home/jamie/focus/lib/focus/tree.zig, line 591.
(gdb) run
Command 'run' is not supported.
(gdb) start
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) [answered Y; input not from terminal]
Temporary breakpoint 2 at 0x2097dc: file /nix/store/5g4w66g606d46w8pmzwzq7flrlk3k7cs-zig/lib/zig/std/start.zig, line 243.
Starting program: /home/jamie/focus/test 1&gt; '/dev/pts/4' 2&gt; '/dev/pts/5' 
During startup program exited with code 1.
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can get this to work by starting the program, immediately pausing, setting a breakpoint and then resuming. </p>
<p>Holding F8 to continue runs smoothly, like most of the other debuggers. But unlike most of the other debuggers the local variables stop being displayed until I release the key, so I can't just watch the changes in real time.</p>
<h2 id="netbeans">netbeans</h2>
<p>I made a new C++ project with the wizard and hit "Debug Main Project". At first I though nothing happened, but after a while I noticed a small red message box at the bottom-right of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It's actually bigger when it first appears, but it shrinks after a few seconds of not being noticed.</p>
<p>Anyway:</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/netbeans_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It says it can't write to /tmp.</p>
<pre><code><span>jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat &gt; /tmp/test
foo
jamie@machine:~/nixpkgs$ cat /tmp/test
foo
</span></code></pre>
<p>I can write to /tmp.</p>
<p>It also says I should do something like <code>netbeans -J-Dcnd.tmpbase="/home/jamie/netbeans-project"</code>. But that produces the same error message, still referring to "/tmp" rather than the directory I gave it. Did I spell something wrong?</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ strace netbeans 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'tmp'

[nix-shell:~]$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It doesn't actually seem to be trying to write "/tmp". It actually doesn't issue any syscalls at all when I press "Debug Main Project" and trigger the message. So I think it's just misreporting some other error. The underlying issue is probably nix-related again.</p>
<p>Also... I try to avoid ranting about software, because software is hard. But if you give me an error message and then make the error text non-selectable and then in the context menu only offer "Mark As Read" instead of "Copy To Clipboard So I Can Google This" then it makes debugging a lot slower.</p>
<h2 id="cgdb">cgdb</h2>
<p>Broadly similar to gdb -tui. It shows the source window and has a lot of useful keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't display much ambient information like current backtrace or local variables. Everything seems to work, but it's not what I'm looking for.</p>
<h2 id="kdevelop">kdevelop</h2>
<pre><code><span>[nix-shell:~]$ kdevelop --version
kdevelop 5.5.2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Running, breaking, setting watchpoints and navigating the backtrace all worked smoothly.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a memory view or a way to display arbitrary expressions. I tried adding <code>display (*actual.items.ptr)@100</code> in the gdb console and it didn't appear anywhere on screen, nor did it print the result in the console after the first time.</p>
<p>The rendering of large arrays is a bit annoying - you have to click at the beginning to reveal a few more elements, but they appear at the end. So getting the whole thing on screen requires lots of scrolling.</p>
<p>The key binding for 'next' is also in use by kate, so you have to go into the bindings menu and disambiguate. Which wouldn't be a big deal except that it reset several times over the course of a single session so I had to keep visiting the bindings menu.</p>
<h2 id="gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</h2>
<p>An init file for gdb that adds a dashboard, which is printed whenever the program stops and can be hooked to print at other times too.</p>
<p><img src="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/looking-for-debugger-2/gdb-dashboard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is pretty great. It doesn't offer the easy point-and-click of a gui but it does reliably put a bunch of useful context on the screen. And it manages to do that without breaking or hiding basic features of gdb like most of the gui frontends I tried. </p>
<p>I'm still on the lookout for a good gui debugger, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.</p>
<h2 id="voltron">voltron</h2>
<p>Loris Cro suggested voltron which is similar to gdb-dashboard but opens the various view in separate terminals and updates them in real time. This seems like a strict improvement and I really like the idea.</p>
<p>After wading through the usual python dependency management morass, I managed to occasionally run some voltron views but mostly managed to crash it repeatedly, and occasionally gdb too. </p>
<p>(The gdb crashes are in <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/ad867039557cc4c6f5ffe22e4f14a0f13fa78c86">somewhere inside printf</a> so this might be the same issue as the tui crash above.) </p>
<h2 id="gdb-frontend">gdb-frontend</h2>
<p>Ilmari Lauhakangas suggested the somewhat generically named gdb-frontend. </p>
<p>If I type the full path in the file picker it pops up "An error has occurred". You have to type the dirname and then pick the file from the list.</p>
<p>When I ran the program it reached the breakpoint and then the UI stopped responding to button clicks and occasionally spat out messages saying the gdb main thread was blocking.</p>
<p>After C-c in terminal it left behind a bunch of ophan gdb processes that prevented gdbfrontend from being restarted.</p>
<h3 id="ddd-again">ddd (again)</h3>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410215">drosan explained</a> that in ddd the focus follows the mouse which explains why I had trouble typing in the text boxes.</p>
<p>The other bugs I experienced are still blockers though.</p>

<p>Other tools that came up in the conversation:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hugsy/gef">gef</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg">pwndbg</a> add a bunch of commands to gdb that are useful for low-level debugging and reverse engineering. 
<a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2">radare2</a> is an independent set of tools for the same purpose that can optionally connect to gdb. I don't have much use for these at the moment, but it's good to know about them.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeclap.itch.io/codeclap">codeclap</a> looks interesting but is still in alpha and doesn't have a demo.</p>
<p><a href="https://pernos.co/">pernosco</a> is a project I've been keeping an eye on. It's not currently affordable for hobby stuff, but I can certainly imagine paying for it when I start doing commercial work again.</p>
<p><a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> injects javascript code into binaries. At the very least, this enables post-hoc println debugging. I've put aside a weekend in my calendar to try it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/blinkenlights/index.html">blinkenlights</a> I think is a way to watch your code execute as directly as possible, so you can build intuition for what is actually happening on the hardware. I tried it out quickly and it rendered a single frame before exiting with code 0. But it's interesting enough that I made a note to come back and try it again next year.</p>
<p>I haven't tried many proprietary options so far. While I have a strong preference for foss tools, I'm open to suggestions for good proprietary tools so long as I can try them out without emailing a sales team for a quote.</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a disdain towards Apple products. Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed. </p>



<p>But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p>



<p>After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them. </p>



<h2>Talk About Impact And Not Numbers</h2>



<p>Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product. </p>



<p>This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value. </p>



<p>However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="300" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020.jpg 1000w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-300x169.jpg 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-768x432.jpg 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-100x56.jpg 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Apple_m1-chip-cpu-power-chart_11102020-700x394.jpg 700w" data-sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></figure></div>



<p>Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/themes/veen/assets/images/transparent.gif" data-lazy="true" data-src="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png" alt="Battery Copy Example" width="430" height="324" data-srcset="https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1024x774.png 1024w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-300x227.png 300w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-768x581.png 768w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1536x1161.png 1536w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-100x76.png 100w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-595x450.png 595w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1-1588x1200.png 1588w, https://quixoticnomad.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-12-at-3.34.07-PM-1.png 1868w" data-sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></figure></div>



<p>Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljApzn9YWmk">video link</a>). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales. </p>



<p>So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points. </p>



<p>With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer. </p>



<p>We see this work again in the following:</p>

<p>This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving. </p>



<p>How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that. </p>



<p>For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment. </p>



<h2>Talk Like A Human</h2>



<p>This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer. </p>



<p>When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example: </p>

<p>Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person. </p>



<p>The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them. </p>



<p>This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app. </p>



<p>So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint. </p>



<p>This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to. </p>

<p>Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes – <em>“Good artists make, great artists steal”</em></p>

      <h2>Results and their interpretation for the First Kakoune Community Survey</h2>

<p>You’ll find below the results to the (now closed)
<a href="https://s.surveyplanet.com/hYB1V90ul">First Kakoune Community Survey</a>,
as well as general <a href="#takeaways">takeaways</a> derived from them. An interpretation
of the data is also provided when relevant. All the specific questions
(e.g. the multiple-choice ones) that were asked had for objective to shed some
light on a specific point, interpreting the replies is a useful indicator of
whether the contributors to the <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune editor</a> are
headed in the right direction, are aware of the biggest problems the users
face, and have an accurate vision of how the tool is being used in the wild.</p>

<p>Note that the raw free-writing type answers will not be attached to this post,
as I cannot extract them easily out of the survey platform used for polling.
I also wouldn’t like users to hesitate to be open about their opinions of
the editor in future polls, out of fear that their words might end up being
published (albeit without any identifying information attached to them).</p>

<p>Thanks to the 151 respondents who have donated their precious time to take
the survey!</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: There are only a couple of such questions in the poll, but the
percentages in some doughnut graphs are not accurate! The survey platform
fooled me into thinking the number associated with a frequency would be an
index, to facilitate statistical analysis via programming. Those turned out
to be weights for rating computation (second column named
“Rating” on the pictures). Changing the values after the fact in the
survey platform’s interface resulted into the data being corrupted and
unusable, so read the <em>Adjusted data</em> when I provided them, they’re the
real numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-questions">The questions</h2>

<h3 id="q1-how-did-you-learn-about-kakoune">Q1: How did you learn about Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_1-how_did_you_learn_about_kakoune.png" alt="Question 1">
</a></p>

<p>Social information sharing platforms are the crossroad that directs users
towards Kakoune, by far.</p>

<p>Hits from the “internet highway” (search engines) have a low conversion
rate in comparison, which could indicate that some SEO work needs to be
done on the main site.</p>

<p>Despite being as big as personal recommendations and web searches, the
“other” category only presents separate, unrelated, anecdotal data points.</p>

<h3 id="q2-have-you-ever-personally-recommended-kakoune-to-a-anybody-in-person-or-online">Q2: Have you ever personally recommended Kakoune to a anybody, in person or online?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_2-have_you_ever_personally_recommended_kakoune_to_anybody_in_person_or_online.png" alt="Question 2">
</a></p>

<p>Two-thirds of users report having personally recommended the editor to
somebody else. It shows that the tool has a significant enough impact on its
users that most of them would get out of their way to recommend it to others.</p>

<p>However, when stacking these replies with those to the previous question,
we can see that a low percentage of those recommendations have resulted in
a user adopting Kakoune.</p>

<h3 id="q3-how-often-do-you-use-the-editor">Q3: How often do you use the editor?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_3-how_often_do_you_use_the_editor.png" alt="Question 3">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>daily: 56%</li>
  <li>rarely: 29%</li>
  <li>weekly: 10%</li>
  <li>monthly: 3%</li>
</ul>

<p>Being branded as a code editor, it’s not surprising that most users report
using Kakoune daily.</p>

<p>Close to one third of users report using it “rarely”, which is an
unexpected outcome. The silver lining could be that those users still find
a corner-case use to the editor on occasion, which apparently cannot be
better fulfilled with any other tools. I’ll take 45 “rarely”s over
45 “never”s!</p>

<h3 id="q4-how-long-have-you-used-kakoune-regardless-of-frequency-of-use">Q4: How long have you used Kakoune, regardless of frequency of use?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_4-how_long_have_you_used_kakoune.png" alt="Question 4">
</a></p>

<p>Adjusted data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>less than a year: 60%</li>
  <li>a few years (1-3): 32%</li>
  <li>a long time (more than 3 years): 6%</li>
</ul>

<p>A reasonable amount of users have stuck around over the years. Future
surveys will tell us more about the tool’s retention rate, but I’m confident
considering the increasing frequency of discussions in the community (forums,
IRC, reddit etc.).</p>

<h3 id="q5-do-you-use-kakoune-for-work-if-yes-what-do-you-mainly-use-it-for">Q5: Do you use Kakoune for work? If yes, what do you mainly use it for?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_5-do_you_use_kakoune_for_work.png" alt="Question 5">
</a></p>

<p>Out of 142 respondents, 3 explicitly stated they do not use the editor for
work (in “other”), and 9 did not reply since the question is predicated
on whether the respondent does use Kakoune for work. 92% of users trust
the editor to help them fulfill their job duties. That’s a badge of
honour in itself considering the focus other bigger editors/IDEs (Integrated
Development Environment) place on a self-awarded stamp of work-friendliness,
and the total absence of it in Kakoune.</p>

<p>Another nice surprise is that 5% of respondents who use Kakoune for work
mostly write generic prose with the editor, showing that the editor is a
versatile tool that doesn’t only appeal to programmers.</p>

<h3 id="q6-what-statements-best-describe-how-you-use-kakoune">Q6: What statements best describe how you use Kakoune?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_6-what_statements_best_describe_how_you_use_kakoune.png" alt="Question 6">
</a></p>

<p>The results are in line with the answers to the previous question. The
resolution of the way users interact with the tool is increased here, as
almost 20% of users have selected two or more statements (different than
“other” or reiterated in the “other” form that they use Kakoune as
a specialised tool, option 2). This reveals that the editor is in fact no
just a uni-dimensional tool, but a convenient utility suitable in separate
situations.</p>

<h3 id="q7-what-is-your-job-title">Q7: What is your job title?</h3>

<p>As a way to compliment the answers to the previous questions (<em>how</em> the tool
is being used), respondents indicated in <em>what</em> capacity they interacted
with Kakoune.</p>

<p>Here are the fields the respondents work in:</p>

<p>Software Engineering: 79%
Student: 7%
Science related fields (data science, mathematics, research…): 5%
Unemployed: 2%</p>

<p>Note that one respondent works as a Musician, and another does programming
as a hobby, proving once again the versatility of the tool.</p>

<h3 id="q8-what-systems-do-you-use-kakoune-on">Q8: What system(s) do you use Kakoune on?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_8-what_systems_do_you_use_kakoune_on.png" alt="Question 8">
</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>139 respondents use Linux (the poll shows 138, but one respondent used the
<code>other</code> field to specify <code>GNU/Linux</code>)</li>
  <li>of those, 50 use the editor on another system, along with Linux; 35 out
of those 50 respondents use Mac</li>
  <li>99 respondents use the editor on only one system: 89 exclusively use Linux, 8 Mac</li>
  <li>out of the 7 respondents who mentioned using Windows, only one uses it
exclusively, all other respondents declared using it along with Linux</li>
</ul>

<p>The above data helps figure out which systems should be prioritised in terms
of support: most users only use Linux, and roughly half as many exclusively
use Mac.</p>

<p>However, the numbers also reveal that many use Kakoune on several systems
at once, fortunately the most popular combination is comprised of Linux
and Mac, so the previous data point did not hide anything.</p>

<p>A statistically relevant amount of users (&lt;10% in all), albeit comparatively
small compared to the core of Linux/Mac users, uses BSD, Windows, WSL,
Illumos, NixOS. Future surveys will reveal if these populations are growing,
and if support for those platforms should be watched more carefully (even
though any user reporting an issue on any platform they’re using will get
help if possible).</p>

<h3 id="q9-is-kakoune-your-main-code-editor-if-yes-what-other-editor-were-you-mainly-using-before-switching-over-to-kakoune-if-not-what-is-preventing-you-from-switching-over-to-kakoune">Q9: Is Kakoune your main code editor? If yes, what other editor were you mainly using before switching over to Kakoune? If not, what is preventing you from switching over to Kakoune?</h3>

<p>After reading all the replies and taking count, I found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>75 respondents use Kakoune as their main editor, and stated switching
over from the following editors (5 have not documented that information):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>35 Vim</li>
      <li>18 NeoVim</li>
      <li>9 Emacs</li>
      <li>6 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Vis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>68 respondents do not use Kakoune as their main editor, and 42 among them
have kindly stated what editor they use instead:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>23 Vim</li>
      <li>6 NeoVim</li>
      <li>5 Emacs</li>
      <li>5 VScode</li>
      <li>2 Sublime Text</li>
      <li>1 RStudio</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The most common reasons that held respondents back from switching over were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no time or motivation to learn</li>
  <li>difficult to add support for custom languages</li>
  <li>some plugins were not implemented for Kakoune</li>
  <li>too tedious to migrate the user configuration</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_10-do_you_use_third_party_plugins_written_by_the_community.png" alt="Question 10">
</a></p>

<p>Two third of respondents do use plugins written by members of the community,
which hints us that there is an ecosystem that delivers useful extensions
to the editor.</p>

<h3 id="q11-do-you-write-custom-kakoune-scripts">Q11: Do you write custom Kakoune scripts?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_11-do_you_write_custom_kakoune_script.png" alt="Question 11">
</a></p>

<p>Most users don’t need to write their own plugins, which could mean that
those already available cover the most common needs among the community,
or that they simply don’t need to extend the editor with plugins (it already
“just works”).</p>

<p>I could also be that most users don’t care to implement the features they’re
lacking, and just stick around until somebody else does.</p>

<h3 id="q12-do-you-publish-those-scripts-online-on-github-gitlab-etc">Q12: Do you publish those scripts online (on Github, Gitlab etc.)?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png">
    <img src="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_12-do_you_publish_those_scripts_online.png" alt="Question 12">
</a></p>

<p>According to the data from question #11, roughly half of respondents
that write plugins publish them online to be used by the community.</p>

<p>This could mean that the average plugin is so small that it’s not seen as
worthy of being published.</p>

<h3 id="q13-what-plugins-do-not-exist-yet-that-you-wish-were-available">Q13: What plugins do not exist yet that you wish were available?</h3>

<p>The replies to this question are quite spread out, with most suggestions
being mentioned only by a single respondent. Here are the ones that appeared
six times, making up the most mentioned suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>support for <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree-sitter</a></li>
  <li>better support for the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a></li>
  <li>an advanced Git wrapper, similar to <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit">Magit</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The following suggestions were all suggested 3 times each, and follow the
above in the list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a diff viewer, similar to <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/diff.html">VimDiff</a></li>
  <li>support for the <a href="https://orgmode.org/">OrgMode</a> format</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/453">code folding</a> support</li>
  <li>better support for fuzzy-matching, similar to
<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>; one respondent mentioned the ability
not to have to use a multiplexer to open a file found via the utility</li>
</ul>

<p>Among the anecdotal suggestions, here’s a list of those I find interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a browsable undo tree</li>
  <li>a scroll bar</li>
  <li>a set of commands to interact with Git hunks (select, revert etc.)</li>
  <li>a wrapper of <code>:make</code> that handles more error formats</li>
  <li>a merge tool for Mercurial</li>
  <li>an integrated Python debugger</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some suggestions (not given here) were not entirely relevant,
as they were more of a bug report, feature request of generic remark that
were not related to plugins.</p>

<p>This is useful information, as it helps directing the efforts of contributors
who would want to implement a plugin, backed with data.</p>

<h3 id="q14-in-what-languages-do-you-read-software-documentation-in-on-your-system">Q14: In what language(s) do you read software documentation in, on your system?</h3>

<p><a href="https://kakoune-editor.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/community_survey_01/question_14-in_what_languages_do_you_read_software_documentation_in_on_your_system.png">

</a></p>

<p>The editor assumes that most of its users are comfortable reading its
documentation and user interface in English, which is comforted by the
data above.</p>

If you have been living in the Single Page App world for a while, you will realize forms written in normal HTML is not that bad. IHP gives you a convenient way of writing forms with server-side validation.</li><li>Use Elm for the <strong>advanced UI stuff</strong> requiring heavy use of DOM manipulation. Elm shines in writing user interfaces with high complexity. If the lines of JavaScript are getting too many, turn to Elm!</li><li>Do you want the content to have <strong>SSR</strong> for search engine optimization? Use HSX.</li></ul><p>So unless you really want to write a full Single Page App, Elm should be used with restraint in IHP, for only specific supercharged parts of the site.</p><p><strong>Most sites are actually better off outputting just HTML and CSS.</strong></p><h2>Next up</h2><p>I want to take this application further in future posts showing you how to interact between IHP and Elm, and how use Elm within protected boundaries (requiring authentication).

          <h2>How to speed up long-distance HTTP file downloads by 6x</h2>
	  <p><small>10-12-2020</small></p>
          <hr>
          <p>The vast majority of HTTP communications use the TCP protocol to transfer data. TCP connections deliver data in-order and without message loss through the use of retransmits and message buffers. Since buffers need to store all sent messages before they are acknowledged, the maximum achievable throughput of a TCP connection is calculatable by a function of buffer size and latency. In long distance communications, this maximum throughput is often lower than the line speed, slowing down the connection on a line that could support faster communications. In this article we explore what impact these buffers have on TCP connection throughput in Linux for HTTP file downloads, demonstrating performance improvements of up to 6x over Ubuntu defaults on a connection with a 200ms ping.</p>

<pre><code>sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="1024000 8738000 2147483647"</code></pre>
<p>Running the above script on both the client and server will increase download throughput on long distance at the cost of increased memory usage (up to 8GB of memory allocated across all TCP streams) on both the server and client.</p>


<p>The TCP protocol guarentees lossless in-order communication through the use of receive and transmit buffers, memory dedicated to holding the contents of messages which have not finished processing yet. The receive buffers store fragments of messages received out of order until all preceeding data is accounted for, while transmit buffers store messages that have been sent but are not yet acknowledged, in case they need to be retransmitted. Typically these buffers are allocated a finite amount of memory per-stream by an operating system, and exhaustion of these buffers leads to stalled connections and overall lower throughput.</p>
<p>Latency, the time it takes for a message transmitted to be received, is particularly good at triggering the exhaustion of TCP connection buffers. Every message sent by a TCP connection must be acknowledged by the receiving side before it can be removed from the sender's transmit buffer, which means that even in ideal conditions a single round trip must take place before a slot in the transmit buffer can be freed. If the buffer is exhausted then the sender will stall, since no new messages can be added to the transmit buffer. As such, when sending lots of data long-distance, the maximum achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>buffer size in bytes * (1 / latency in seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This bottleneck, plus the fairly opaque relationship between buffer size, latency, and overall connection throughput, can often make users believe that their internet connection is slow, when really they have just failed to allocate enough memory to take full advantage of the bandwidth they have available.</p>
<p>NOTE: Arrangement of TCP windows is a component of the TCP protocol we will gloss over today. TCP connections communicate their buffer sizes as windows, so that the other end of a connection does not overwhelm them with too much data. On Linux, the window size communicated is decided by the memory allowed to be allocated to a single TCP connection.</p>


<p>In this experiment we demonstrate the impact that TCP buffer sizes have on long-distance TCP connection throughput by configuring buffer sizes on a Linux (Ubuntu) server and client. To do this we download a randomly generated file over a server hosted in Germany from a client in Hong Kong (~200ms ping). Linux allows users to change the minimum, maximum, and default amount of memory allocated to each TCP stream. Most distributions set low limits by default in order to preserve system resources. In our experiment we show that the impact of increasing these values on both the client and server can be quite dramatic, demonstrating up to a 6x increase in HTTP download speed.</p>

<h2>Low Defaults</h2>
<p>This work was motivated after observing that the Debian and Ubuntu default buffer sizes seemed to be set too low. At time of writing the TCP sysctl settings on my Regolith Linux (Ubuntu derived distribution) were set to:</p>
<pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 131072 6291456
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 16384 4194304</code></pre>
<p>In simple terms, this allows for a 6MB receive buffer and a 4MB send buffer. Thus, by the formula above our total achievable throughput is:</p>
<pre><code>600000 * (1/0.2) = ~3MB/s = ~50Mbps</code></pre>
<p>This total achievable throughput is a far cry from the potential of our gigabit network, which should enable transfers at nearly 125MB/s.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>We configure two Linux machines (Ubuntu Server), one acting as a client and one acting as a webserver. The server machine has the maximum buffer sizes enabled and a large file to download hosted via NGINX. Both our client and server have 1Gbps internet links, with the client located in Hong Kong and the server in Germany.</p>
<p>For each buffer size we set the client's transmit and receive TCP buffer limit and default to the specified size, but we do not change other TCP settings. For these tests we use the default TCP congestion profile on Ubuntu (cubic) and have default settings for TCP slow start.</p>
<p>To test bandwidth we set the large file downloading with a time limit of ten minutes. As the file downloads we the average throughput. To automate this test we use the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># run_tests
while read p; do
  echo "# Starting test with $p"
  ./configure_settings "${p}"

  echo "# Sleeping"
  sleep 240

  echo "# Going"
  timeout 10m curl http://dev.parsed.uk/file.data --output /dev/null

done &lt; test.txt </code></pre>
<p>This script sequentially executes the same test with different test configurations loaded from test.txt.</p>

<pre><code># prepare for test
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_default=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl -w net.core.optmem_max=50331648
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_mem="2097152 2097152 2097152"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="$1"
sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1</code></pre>
<p>This script sets the TCP parameters for the test. The scripts are available on Github <a href="https://github.com/jawline/tcp-test-configuration">here</a>. We allowed a four minute period between setting sysctl settings and beginning the test to allow for the TCP settings to properly apply.</p>

<h2>Results &amp; Conclusions</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.parsed.uk/images/tcp_graph_original.png"></p>
<p>From our results we see that the TCP buffer sizes have a significant impact on throughput long distance. The maximum throughput observed during testing (21MB/s) was over 6x faster than the throughput for the client with a default configuration (~3-4MB/s). We observe that increases in buffer size correlate with increased in throughput until we reach 64MB TCP buffers. In our tests we see throughput peak at 21MB/s, and see no further gain in increasing buffer sizes beyond this. This is likely a limitation of one of the two servers, or the network that links them together. If our testing was not limited by other factors, we should observe further increases in performance was we increase TCP buffer sizes beyond that. Additionally, note that our testing is not rigerous, we performed a single test at each TCP memory increments and do not control for external factors such as network fluctuations or peak time load at the datacenter. Regardless, the limited testing methodology is still sufficient to show the clear trend of increasing throughput with TCP buffer sizes.</p>
<p>While unbounding the maximum buffer sizes is probably not ideal for most configurations, we suggest increasing buffer sizes to allow for 64-128MB per TCP stream on systems where the memory is available.</p>

<p>BitChute has banned the Nordic Resistance Movement’s <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/nmr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official channel</a>, the NRM radio channel and has deleted a large number of videos uploaded by other users featuring the Resistance Movement in what appears to be a mass wave of censorship.</p>
<p>The “free speech” video site replaced the Nordic Resistance Movement’s account with the following message on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your channel has been blocked for breaching the BitChute Community Guidelines.</p>
<p>An email was sent to your registered email address detailing the reasoning behind this decision.</p>
<p>If you have not received it, or wish to appeal against the decision, then please&nbsp;contact us.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, despite this claim, no emails have been received to our registered email address from BitChute. In addition, no warnings or notifications about our videos were received by the Resistance Movement from BitChute prior to the ban.</p>
<p>This is not the first instance of BitChute censoring legitimate content on its site. Recently, BitChute blocked a number of popular channels in various countries, forcing users to use a VPN in order to view them. The censorship followed BitChute’s <a href="https://support.bitchute.com/announcements/response-to-hope-not-hate-report-on-bitchute" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> in July in which they “encouraged organizations like Hope Not Hate” (a UK-based “anti-racist” organisation) to “help them improve their processes”.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the humble ASX is actually pretty damn big – as of December 4th, it has a market cap of $2,466,617,359,800. If you find that number to be a little difficult to parse, try writing it in text: <em>two-trillion-four-hundred-and-sixty-six-billion-six-hundred-and-seventeen-million-three-hundred-and-fifty-nine-thousand-eight-hundred-dollars. </em></p>



<p>Below is a bubble chart showing all 2193 companies currently listed on the ASX sized in proportion to their market cap. You can hover over individual bubbles to see the full name of the company and its market cap. </p>







<p>As the bubble chart indicates, the vast bulk of the ASX is made up of just a handful of companies. In fact, the top 27 companies, a mere 1.2% of the ~2200 listed, account for over 50% of the total market cap:</p>







<p>The ASX 300, or 300 biggest companies by market cap, accounts for over 91% of the total, which is what popular index funds like VAS track; rather than buying shares in all 2193 companies, they just buy the biggest few hundred because the vast majority of publicly listed companies are such ‘small fish’. Small fish of course being a relative term – a company needs to be worth close to a billion dollars to make it into the ASX 300.</p>



<p>For example, The Reject Shop (TRS) with its 350 stores and nearly 6000 employees has a market cap of a mere $273 million, putting it in 557th place, not even on the radar of a typical index fund, and completely dwarfed by the current top dog, CBA: </p>







<p>Sadly the label won’t actually fit on The Reject Shop’s circle above because of its relative size to The Commonwealth Bank. </p>



<p>But don’t let that go to your head, CBA holders. You’re a big fish in a small pond, but you’re a tiny fish in a big pond. Plankton, really. Here’s the ASX next to Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company:</p>







<p>Yes, you’re seeing that right – Apple is about 20% larger than the combined market cap of every Australian company put together. Here’s how things look when we add in 7 more of the world’s largest companies:</p>







<p>All of Australia’s public companies put together are roughly equivalent to a Microsoft or an Amazon, but significantly smaller than both Apple and Saudi Arabia’s ARAMCO. </p>



<p>Finally, here’s how the ASX looks next to some other exchanges.</p>







<p>As the visualisation shows, the ASX’s total 2.4T market cap pales into insignificance compared to the 38T and 17.4T market caps of the NYSE and Nasdaq. </p>



<p>According to the World Federation of Exchanges, the collective market capitalisation of the world’s stock exchanges is around 95 trillion US dollars, meaning the entire ASX represents well under 2% of the planet’s publicly listed companies.</p>

      <h2>What's all this, then?</h2>
      <p><strong>BLABRECS</strong> is a rules modification for the wordgame SCRABBLE that swaps out the dictionary of real-if-obscure English words for a capricious artificial intelligence. In BLABRECS, real English words aren't allowed! Instead, you have to play nonsense words that <em>sound</em> like English to the AI. These nonsense words are called – you guessed it – BLABRECS.</p>
      <h2>How do I play?</h2>
      <p>Get together your regular SCRABBLE supplies and pull up this page in a web browser. Then play SCRABBLE as normal, but before you play a word, use the "test a word..." box at the top of the page to check whether the AI will let you play it. Remember, you can only play words that the AI approves!</p>
      <p>When you find a legal word to play, hit the "Play It" button to add this word to the lexicon. As you play, you can write in definitions for all the words you've invented in the "Meaning" textbox next to each word. The player who comes up with the best definition for a word can add half of that word's points to their SCRABBLE score at the end of the game.</p>
      <h2>I found a real word that the AI thinks is playable! What should I do?</h2>
      <p>This happens often with proper nouns (which SCRABBLE generally disallows) and with inflected forms of base words that are disallowed. I think you should play by the spirit of BLABRECS and not the letter, but what this means is ultimately up to you. Is the game primarily about exploring the vast "shadow English" implied by the statistical distribution of letter sequences, or is it about the inherent absurdity of an external authority presuming to dictate your language to you? Either interpretation seems valid to me.</p>
      <h2>How does the AI work?</h2>
      <p>Right now it uses a Markov model trained on the <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/">ENABLE word list</a> used in a number of wordgames. It looks at the statistical patterns of letter sequences in English words and uses this information to determine how likely a sequence of letters is to be a real English word. Then it rejects both real dictionary words and fake words that it deems insufficiently plausible. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/mkremins/blabrecs">source code</a> if you want to learn more.</p>
      <p>I might update BLABRECS to provide a wider range of AI "opponents" using a variety of different technologies in the future. Stay tuned!</p>
      <h2>Why is it called BLABRECS?</h2>
      <p>I generated every possible permutation of the word SCRABBLE and asked an early version of the AI to sort them from least to most statistically likely. BRABLECS won out by a significant margin, beating not only the real word SCRABBLE but also my hand-designed previous title BESCRALB. Then I switched the L and the R because BLABRECS sounds better and I'm not about to let a computer tell me what to do.</p>
      <h2>Who are you?</h2>
      <p>I'm <a href="https://mkremins.github.io/">Max Kreminski</a>, an artifical intelligence researcher and game designer. At the time of this release (December 2020), I'm working on my PhD in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I make a lot of weird stuff with AI; if you want to keep tabs on my work, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski">follow me on Twitter</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>There’s a resurgence in products using text as the primary user interface.</p>
<p>The most popular tool that uses text as a core UI is probably Microsoft Excel. Excel is a mostly-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> application, but when interacting with formulas and programming cells, the interface of choice for most users is text – typing in formulas as textual information, not clicking buttons. When we want to take the sum over a row, most of us click on the cell and type <code>=SUM(A3:A10)</code> – we don’t click on a “sum” button or unfurl a dropdown menu.</p>
<p>The poster child of textual user interfaces is the command line in the terminal. But I think a new crop of tools, combined with a more tech-savvy market, is staging the rebirth of text as a user interface. Textual interfaces are everywhere in the modern workplace. Slash-commands in Slack and Discord and Notion, hash-tags for channels and tagging, special syntax for searching and querying data across applications, @-mentions in social media and team work environments, and so on. We’re training ourselves to be more savvy users of the <em>textual interface</em>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/text-interface.jpg" alt="Text as an interface">
</p>
<h2 id="the-forces-at-work">The forces at work</h2>
<p>I think we’re seeing textual interfaces rise in popularity wherever people look for any of the following.</p>
<h3 id="progressive-feature-discovery">Progressive feature discovery</h3>
<p>Text interfaces within graphical UIs gained popularity in places with a high feature-to-visual-complexity budget. In other words, when there’s many more features than can fit comfortably on the screen at once, we hide that surplus complexity behind text options.</p>
<p>In many tools with a high degree of hidden complexity, the average user uses only a small subset of those features frequently. A Slack workspace, for example, might have a hundred slash-commands enabled, but each individual team member may only frequently use 5-10 of those commands on a regular basis. Rather than clutter up the interface with a hundred buttons or a web of dropdown menus, we hide the complexity behind text options, and the user can learn the few features they use most frequently, so they can access them again easily.</p>
<p>This idea applies to tools with a lot of complexity, where any single user might only take advantage of a small subset of that feature set. I think more tools are falling into this bucket as productivity tools consolidate. If a single kind of interface is shared by all business-chat clients, or all product-management tools, or version control software – rather than building custom interfaces for each workflow or use case, why not provide a wide surface area of functionality that’s accessible via text?</p>
<h3 id="extensibility-and-the-portable-interface">Extensibility and the portable interface</h3>
<p>Modern software workflows cross application and service boundaries all the time. Textual interfaces provide an enforceable, rigorous contract between services and applications that can act as the interfaces for apps to integrate with external services, in a way that visual interfaces can’t.</p>
<p>In a software development team, a proposal for a bug fix might flow through a task tracker, which connects with a team messaging app, where an engineer might run a group poll or lead a discussion. The request change might flow back into the task tracker, into a version control system like GitHub, and then deploy automatically to production servers.</p>
<p>Workflows like this require that apps from completely different vendors and domains are able to communicate with each other. More importantly, it requires that the interfaces we use to control these tools be <em>portable</em>. A portable interface carries the same kind of UI across different services, so the user can interact with any service similarly across all of its integrations. Portability means that we can enter data into our task tracker through our chat client, or request the rollout of a change through an infrastructure provider from our version control system.</p>
<p>These integration points are much easier to build, and easier to master as end users, when they all share the same, portable format – text.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Textual interfaces make automation trivial, and automation tools much easier to build.</p>
<p>More people are using tools like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://runalloy.com/">Alloy</a> to automate common business tasks or link very domain-specific workflows together across services. Having a shared portable interface across these apps, and a syntax format that can serve as a contract for how to use that interface, makes it possible for these automation points to communicate to dozens of other services easily. It also minimizes the possibility that a future update to the UI might break an automated workflow.</p>
<p>Text interfaces are much easier for machines to use. And as more work is done autonomously by the workflows we teach machines to perform, text interfaces are starting to matter just as much as human ones.</p>
<h3 id="sharability">Sharability</h3>
<p>People naturally want to document their workflows to remember, share, and iterate upon as a team. To share a graphical workflow, I’d need to record my screen or spend time writing down instructions for how to navigate a visual interface, clicking the right buttons and checking the right boxes. Reifying workflows as text makes this much easier – I can just encode a workflow into a few lines of text input.</p>
<p>In this way, workflows driven by text interfaces are easier to share, document, and iterate over time within a team. Text interfaces make workflows more concrete.</p>
<h2 id="workflows-not-data-are-the-subject-of-innovation">Workflows, not data, are the subject of innovation</h2>
<p>Given these benefits of text as an interface, weighted against the very real cost – text is a more esoteric way to use a computer – why are we seeing a resurgence in this trend now?</p>
<p>I think the easiest factor we can identify is that more people entering the workforce are unafraid of textual interfaces, because they’ve been typing and messaging and tagging their friends online all their life. They already interact with computers via text.</p>
<p>But the second reason that’s driving the industry to text is that <strong>the focus of software services has shifted from manipulating <em>data</em> to manipulating <em>workflows</em>.</strong> We’ve learned how to store and sift through data in our computers as a society, so we’re moving up a step of abstraction, to storing and sharing the how’s of our work, not just the what’s.</p>
<p>Workflows, not data, are the subject of product innovation now. And the subject is easier to study, to compare, to share and extend, when it’s concrete and durable, not an organic, ephemeral series of actions.</p>
<p>I think as long as we’re innovating on <em>how</em> we work, and how the services we use can work together more effectively, text as an interface is here to stay. And why not? The software industry has spent the last half-century building tools to help us wrangle with text, and we can rediscover those tools and ideas again.</p>
<p>We’re entering a renaissance of user interfaces, not in the sense of a novel paradigm shift, but in the sense of a rediscovery of classic, enduring ideas on which we can build better tools and systems. And I, for one, welcome it.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really paying attention, so maybe I’m the only one that hadn’t noticed, but Tesla’s market cap as of December 9th 2020 is a touch over 616 billion US dollars. That makes it kind of a big deal. In fact, it accounts for a full third of the global automaker market cap:</p>







<p>Just for a bit of context – Tesla only listed on the stock market 10 years ago (June 2010). The company itself was only founded in 2003. Compare that to Ford which launched in 1903 and basically invented the concept of mass production (the Model T is still one of the best selling cars of all time) or Benz in 1889, whose founder, Karl Benz, literally had a patent on the original goddamn automobile. </p>



<p>Here’s a racing bar chart of a few of the top automakers share prices over the last couple of decades. Tesla both literally and figuratively comes out of nowhere (spoiler alert: things get insane in 2019):</p>







<p>As you can see from the chart, the share price has pretty much 10x’d over the last 12 months. Why? Well, it’s certainly not because Tesla is making 10 times the revenue or shipping 10 times as many cars. In all of 2019, for example, Tesla shipped 367,500 cars. In Q3, 2020, they shipped 139,300 cars, giving them a run rate of around 550,000 cars for the entire year. For context, <strong>Toyota sold 927,623 cars in October 2020 alone</strong> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://global.toyota/en/company/profile/production-sales-figures/" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>



<p>Here’s how Tesla compares to some of the automakers mentioned above in terms of yearly car sales:</p>







<p>No, I didn’t forget to add Tesla to the chart – you just can’t see the label because of how tiny the sales numbers are relative to other automakers (it’s that little blue sliver between Volkswagen and BMW if you still haven’t found it).</p>



<p>As you’d expect from the huge disparity in car sales shown above, Tesla’s revenues are also dwarfed by the bigger incumbents. Expected 2020 revenues are around 28 billion USD – impressive, but more than an order of magnitude less than VW’s 299 billion USD in 2019. </p>







<p>So why does the market have such a hard on for Tesla? As the chart above shows, Tesla’s market cap seems to be completely out of whack with its revenues and earnings (the latter was just 10 million USD in 2019). </p>



<p>The simple answer is that the market is valuing the VW’s, Toyota’s, and Daimler’s of the world on what they are – car companies. Tesla, on the other hand, is being valued as a tech business, and therefore what it *could* be. Car companies are boring and predictable. Technology companies though… Well, they have pretty much unlimited upside, don’t they?</p>



<p>Here are a few things Tesla has going for it.</p>



<ul><li>First, and most obviously, the electric car market is really just getting started. There are close to 100 million new cars per year sold globally, and less than 1% of them are electric, though this number is growing quickly – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-electric-idUSKBN27C08C">it’s already 5% in China</a> – and expected to surpass 50% in most developed nations by 2030. There is even some talk of the UK and EU <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/build-back-greener-boris-johnson-bans-petrol-cars-by-2030-20201119-p56fwn.html" target="_blank">banning sales</a> of new petrol and diesel cars in the not too distant future.<p>Tesla clearly has a first mover advantage here, and a lead on battery technology and EV engineering, though the quantum of this lead is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-battery-technology-electric-vehicles-engineering-51592842119" target="_blank">disputed</a>. </p></li><li>Tesla may be the first company to actually nail self-driving. After overpromising and underdelivering for years (in 2015, Musk predicted FSD could arrive by 2018), Tesla Full Self Driving appears to have <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/12/07/tesla-full-self-driving-speed-bumps-cyclists-no-destination-lane-centering-with-on-street-parking-videos/" target="_blank">launched in beta</a> for some drivers, though early reports of its reliability are mixed.<br></li><li>Revenue growth to date. Sure, as we can see in the above chart, total revenues are still only a fraction of VW’s and Toyota’s, but 10 years ago Tesla had revenues of 100m USD compared to 2020’s projected 28B USD – that’s a roughly 28 fold increase. In the same period, VW’s revenue has increased by about 75%, and Toyota’s by only around 30%.<br></li><li>Well placed in solar and home energy storage. <br></li><li>The Tesla brand is cool, the Elon Musk brand is cool </li></ul>



<p>And finally, Tesla is, for pretty much the first time in its history doing something many of its critics said it would never do – <strong>actually turning a profit</strong>. The 10 million USD profit it made in 2019 was for all intents and purposes breaking even (and was driven largely by sale of regulatory credits), but in 2020 expected profits are a meaty looking 1.26B USD.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In the decade since the 2009 Financial Crisis, I've carried with me two mental models: <strong>Mimicry and Reflexivity</strong>. They describe how perception and reality intermingle, and together they describe some of the most profound ideas on how the human world works.</p>
<p>And I've only just realized these are different sides of the <strong>same</strong> coin.</p>
<p>Most people think in terms of a 1-way causal relationship between perception and reality, comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Plato's Cave</a>. Reality is assumed to be <strong>superior</strong> (e.g. more real) to perception. Reality is also perceived as more <strong>objective</strong> than perception - "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts."</p>
<p>Where this model fails is in appreciating how much of reality is <em>socially constructed</em>, and <em>therefore a matter of perception</em>.</p>
<p>This explains everything from money to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/367596.Manias_Panics_and_Crashes">manias</a>, from democracy to conspiracy, from fashion to religion, from SEO to product design, from hiring to performance management. I could fill a book spelling out the applications of these general ideas in various domains; but it'd make for an insufferably repetitive blogpost. Instead I'll briefly introduce these mental models and invite you to discuss what you see in the mirror.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="mimicry"><a href="#mimicry">Mimicry</a></h2>
  <p>Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry">Batesian Mimicry</a>. This is best explained by analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism">Aposematism</a> in nature, when an animal signals to predators that it is not worth eating<strong>.</strong></p>
  <p>At first, a poisonous frog evolves and its most distinctive outward feature is bright redness. Because they are incentivized to find out about poison <em>before</em> eating, predators start to associate bright redness with poison, and avoid bright red frogs.</p>
  <p>Pop question: <em>what happens next?</em></p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gph3qkg70pjrkvyr29kl.jpg" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Note: While you pause to actually think this through... I'll also observe that the frog is also incentivized to evolve a distinctive signal like bright redness. It is presumably better to help predators figure out you are poisonous than to require them to nibble on you first. This signal is "costly" to develop, so you also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a> occur, where this cost is shared.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Answer: <em>Other frogs turn red</em>. Including the non-poisonous ones. The stronger the signal, the stronger the mimicry. An initially "honest" signal becomes dishonest. Because signals are easier to mimic than the underlying quality, all honest signals eventually get overwhelmed by dishonest ones and lose all meaning. The poisonous frog must then find another signal. The cycle repeats.</p>
  <p><strong>Reality <em>deceives</em> perception as much as it informs</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="reflexivity"><a href="#reflexivity">Reflexivity</a></h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory)">Reflexivity</a> points out circular relationships between cause and effect. This is perhaps oxymoronic, because we are really asserting that "effect" affects "cause" so much so that they are indistinguishable.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/qs28inpo3ilfzqhv2w0p.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>I understand reflexivity best in economics. In George Soros' dense classic <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/369708.The_Alchemy_of_Finance">The Alchemy of Finance</a>, he observed the strange mathematics of the 1980's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger-mania.asp">merger mania</a> - profits of conglomerates were more certain and highly valued than small companies. Their high stock prices enabled them to buy out their smaller cousins and add those profits to theirs, further increasing the stock price (aka "arbitraging" valuation multiples). We understand this math to be obviously unsustainable today, but there is a genuine way in which the high expectations helped enable fundamental actions that at least partially fulfilled those expectations.</p>
  <p>In a more modern context, you could view tech hiring as reflexive. Tech company recruiters often tell a story of high and rising stock prices as part of their compensation story. In this way the valuation of a company (perception) directly influences hiring (reality).</p>
  <p>My third example is perhaps most convincing: Real estate values are reflexive. House prices are influenced by bank lending, and bank lending is determined by the banks' estimation of house prices. Real estate is thus locked in a self reinforcing cycle of boom and bust. Mostly boom, because governments are incentivized to cause boom, and people vote in governments (see a pattern here?).</p>
  <p>Wikipedia equates reflexivity to a positive feedback loop - buyers cause a rising stock price, which attracts more buyers, which causes more rising stock prices. It's fine but far too simplistic. Reflexivity is also about perception <em>legitimately and fundamentally</em> shaping reality and vice versa.</p>
  <p>My definition of reflexivity: <strong>The more you believe something to be true, <em>the more true it becomes</em>.</strong></p>
  <p>Reflexivity isn't a complete or perfect model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The endless ping-pong between cause and effect must stop somewhere, and Reflexivity is silent on <em>when</em> the loop stops (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment">Hyman Minsky</a> for that).</li>
    <li>I am also fond of pointing out <em>anti-reflexivity</em> - <em>the more you believe something to be true, the <strong>less</strong> true it is.</em> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">Efficient Market Hypothesis</a> is glaringly antireflexive - the more people believe it to be true, they passively invest in index funds and give up on looking for market mispricing - which lets mispricing occur.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However it is clearly at least partially explanatory of our reality, and therefore useful.</p>
  <p>As seen in (<em>this is a living list, feel free to ping me with more</em>):</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="synthesis"><a href="#synthesis">Synthesis</a></h2>
  <p>For a long time (over a decade!) I have carried these two models in my head as separate models. But let's put them side by side:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reality <em>deceives</em> perception as much as it informs</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>The more you believe something to be true, <em>the more true it becomes</em>.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Reflexivity builds a positive feedback loop between perception and reality, and Mimicry breaks it.</p>
  <p>This is the insight I had today.</p>

<p>Hiring a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</a> is a difficult feat at the best of times. But for startups, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/non-technical-founder-hiring-cto">a lot rides on choosing the right candidate</a>. Whereas in a large organization a CTO might be expected to focus largely on high-level strategic decisions such as overseeing development teams and finding integration partners, in the startup environment, it’s all hands on deck — from day one.</p>
<p>Your CTO might have to do everything from hop into the code to establish lead sprint meetings, and find time to <a href="https://www.cfpland.com/guides/speaking/">travel to tech conferences</a>.</p>
<p>I was recently asked to help a startup interview a prospective CTO. Here are some of the questions I used during the interview process, and I hope they help you in your CTO hiring process. I’ve ordered these by topic so that you can jump to the ones that best suit your startup’s needs.</p>

<p>For many startups, building a minimal viable product (MVP) is the first technical job to get done as soon as the logo’s been decided upon and the startup garage has been rented. And guess what? For many startups, building it isn’t going to get outsourced to Upwork. Use these questions to gauge your potential CTO’s readiness to get the job done.</p>
<h3 id="1-tell-us-about-your-previous-experience">1. Tell Us About Your Previous Experience?</h3>
<p>You want to gauge whether your potential CTO has pulled off an MVP-development project before. Gambling on a first timer could be a risky proposition. How long did development take? What did the workflow look like? Don’t be shy about asking for the details to make sure that you’re dealing with somebody who will be comfortable taking on <em>your</em> project.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Previous MVP experience with a specific completion timeline.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> The obvious red flag is a potential CTO that has never gotten involved in the MVP creation process before and doesn’t know much about what it typically entails. Whether this will be a dealbreaker for you really depends upon your risk tolerance profile.</p>
<h3 id="2-whats-your-preferred-software-stack">2. What’s Your Preferred Software Stack?</h3>
<p>What tools is your potential CTO familiar with? If you’ve already decided upon a stack, perhaps based upon your other development resources, then you’ll want to look for somebody whose experience is congruous with your own. If your guys use Jenkins but the potential hire only knows Bamboo, this could be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody who knows the stack that you’re interested in.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> It may make life very difficult if your potential hire has never worked with the tools you want to get onboard with. Again, whether this is acceptable or now will depend upon how much risk you’re comfortable taking on.</p>
<h3 id="3-tell-me-about-a-time-you-joined-an-existing-codebase-that-was-in-bad-shape-how-did-you-get-acclimated-to-it-how-did-you-improve">3. Tell Me About A Time You Joined An Existing Codebase That Was In Bad Shape? How did you get acclimated to it? How did you improve?</h3>
<p>In Startupland, QA doesn’t always get the attention it deserves. There are sprint deadlines to meet and resources can be constrained at the best of times. Will your potential hire balk at the site of a code jungle or get to grips with it? Finding out what the potential hire <em>did</em> in order to turn around a situation that was less than ideal can also give you valuable insights about the potential hire’s problem management skills.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody who’s pulled off the process of getting to work on a codebase that was in less than ideal condition.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> If you need somebody who’s going to be comfortable diving in the deep end, then you probably don’t want a candidate that would freak out at the first sign of trouble. If that’s the case, look for somebody who has experienced getting their hands dirty with an ugly codebase.</p>
<h2 id="hiring">Hiring</h2>
<p>A startup CTO will often fulfill functions that budge into traditional HR territory. While human resource functions can be invaluable for their skills in keeping track of benefits and vacation leave, a coder is often the best-placed resource to hire another coder.</p>
<h3 id="4-tell-me-about-the-last-hire-you-made-what-was-your-process-and-who-did-you-hire-why-did-they-stand-out">4. Tell me about the last hire you made. What was your process and who did you hire? Why did they stand out?</h3>
<p>Here, you want to find out whether the potential CTO has a discerning eye for talent. The technical job market is incredibly competitive and it’s important that your potential CTO will be able to separate outstanding candidates from those who are only likely to make a mediocre contribution to your team.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Can your potential CTO provide strong reasons for why they chose to make certain hiring decisions? What did they look for in the successful candidate? Do those reasons align with the type of talent you’re looking to onboard?</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> You’re probably <em>not</em> looking to hire somebody who can’t articulate why he/she made certain hiring decisions</p>
<h3 id="5-have-you-ever-made-a-bad-hire-when-did-you-figure-it-out-what-did-you-do">5. Have you ever made a bad hire? When did you figure it out? What did you do?</h3>
<p>A bad hire can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050876/why-resume-based-hiring-can-spell-disaster-for-startups">spell disaster for an early stage startup</a> that doesn’t have the financial resources to throw good money after bad. Here, you’re trying to assess how quickly your potential CTO remedied the situation — and whether they did at all.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that quickly spotted that there was a problem and took swift action to bring the issue to the bad hire’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Response like <em>“we were a chill company, we didn’t really care”</em> definitely don’t communicate the right attitude. You’ll want somebody that didn’t let a bad situation persist and took action.</p>
<h3 id="6-have-you-ever-had-to-let-someone-go-why">6. Have you ever had to let someone go? Why?</h3>
<p>While the above will provide you with a good sense for the potential hire’s overall managerial ability, you’ll want to dive a little deeper in order to see whether the maybe-CTO was capable of following through on the uncomfortable act of terminating somebody’s employment.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that was able to swifty do what was necessary for the company’s best interests.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Somebody that procrastinated over the job of firing somebody. There’s a chance that they might do the same if the issue crops up at your company.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>These days cybersecurity is a concern for organizations both small and large. One of the key functionalities of a startup CTO is going to be around making sure that all internal systems are properly secured. Does the potential CTO have the required background in security to know what to look for?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zaAN5H5.jpg" alt="CTO candidates should know a substantial amount about security"></p>
<h3 id="7-what-are-some-of-the-first-things-you-would-check-when-evaluating-organizational-security-at-a-startup">7. What are some of the first things you would check when evaluating organizational security at a startup?</h3>
<p>The potential CTO’s in the door. Now what. Do they have a coherent plan for how to bring a security culture to an early stage startup? (<a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/security-tips-startups">Check out this post for tips on what to implement</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that knows what to look for and is able to demonstrate a readiness for how to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Responses like “security isn’t a big focus on mine” or “it could probably wait” are likely indicative of a candidate that will be happy to put security on the backburner for as long as possible.</p>
<h3 id="8-what-are-some-common-security-issues-youve-seen-in-startup-codebases-in-the-past-what-steps-did-you-take-to-mitigate-them">8. What are some common security issues you’ve seen in startup codebases in the past? What steps did you take to mitigate them?</h3>
<p>Again, previous experience is telling. Has your potential CTO encountered common unsecure codebases in the past? And if so, what exactly did they do to take action?</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Experience securing codebases and stacks isn’t necessary, but it would certainly give a potential candidate a leg up. Somebody with experience actioning security best practices might deserve a leg up in your hiring process. A coherent approach to tackling these security issues also vouches for their project management skills.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Candidates who have never had to grapple with this issue before might not have the experience to contribute if they run into issues like this at your organization.</p>
<h3 id="9-when-do-you-not-fix-a-security-vulnerability">9. When do you not fix a security vulnerability?</h3>
<p>This is something of a trick question. Cybersecurity measures have to be <a href="https://firstround.com/review/how-early-stage-startups-can-enlist-the-right-amount-of-security-as-they-grow/">weighed against the resources of the company</a>. For instance, rolling out company-wide encryption on all devices would not be appropriate for most startups. But for organizations that have to comply with data governance standards such as HIPAA, this might be a legislative need.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that demonstrates that they would take a resource-sensitive and measured approach to implementing cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> Somebody that has great security knowledge but fails to weigh up countervailing factors such as cost.</p>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>CTOs can become mini project managers responsible for allocating resources in the development team as carefully as the company needs them to be allocated. Ask a series of questions designed to tease out just how good they might be at this important aspect of the job.</p>
<h3 id="10-describe-for-me-an-agile-development-workflow-youve-used-in-the-past">10. Describe for me an “Agile” development workflow you’ve used in the past?</h3>
<p>If you’re a startup organization, then we reckon there’s, well, quite a high chance that you’re going to be using Agile as your formal development and project management methodology. As with most things, it’s generally advantageous if the CTO candidate can demonstrate that they have prior experience in this field so that they can hit the ground running.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Somebody that, through recounting prior experience, can demonstrate that they have good mastery over the Agile process and can walk you through a prior workflow that they successfully implemented.</p>
<p><strong>What to avoid:</strong> If your potential CTO has neither heard of Agile nor can tell you what a good workflow would look like, then they’re probably going to struggle in an Agile-first environment.</p>
<h3 id="11-describe-for-me-an-agile-development-workflow-youve-used-in-the-past">11. Describe for me an “Agile” development workflow you’ve used in the past?</h3>
<p>This is a great and pointed question to ask if you’d like to learn more about how your potential CTO would handle prioritization and triaging feature requests. Having a clear head about what is necessary and what isn’t is a great way to discern how good your candidate is at prioritization.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> A candidate that is able to …</p></div></article></section></div>

December 13, 2020 | https://itsopensource.com/publish-github-pages-with-github-actions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://itsopensource.com/publish-github-pages-with-github-actions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 12, 2020</p></header><section><p>
GitHub pages are the best way to host static blogs like <code>Gatsby</code>. One of the most common ways to do this is, maintain your code in main/master branch, build it, and then push the code to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
There are various CI that easily automate this process like Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
With GitHub actions, this would be a piece of cake, and without depending on any third-party provider. From the docs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not sure what are GitHub actions please visit <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">here</a>.</p>
<h2><center> Workflow </center></h2>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ol>
<li>You have a static blog(let’s say gatsby) setup, the code for your blog is in master branch.</li>
<li>You have a build script in your package.json</li>
<li>You have setup your GitHub pages (or pointed to your custom domain) in <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Process</h4>
<center><strong> Step 1 </strong></center><br>
Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages">gh-pages npm package</a> in your project, this is a small utility package which helps to publish your code to gh-pages branch.
You can skip this step in case you want to push all contents from master to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.  
<center><strong>Step 2 </strong></center><br>
Add a deploy script in your <code>package.json</code>. This script should do 2 jobs
<ol>
<li>Build the project, make it ready for being published.</li>
<li>Push the changes to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, this pushes the code to <code>gh-pages</code> via npm package.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>"deploy": "gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -r https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;.git"</code></pre></div>
<center><strong>Step 3 </strong></center><br>
Generate an access token and add it to secret of your repository.
<ol>
<li>Create an access token: goto <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>, create a new token, give it access for repo and workflow.  </li>
</ol>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<center><strong>Step 4 </strong></center>  
<ol>
<li>Create a workflow file, you need to create a file in following path: <code>.github/workflows/&lt;some-name-you-like&gt;.yml</code>, its important to have <code>.yml</code> extension and have exact same path.</li>
<li>
<p>Following action file is complete enough to publish <code>gh-pages</code>, every time a new commit is merged in master branch. ✅</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> gh<span>-</span>pages publisher 🚀

<span>on</span><span>:</span>
<span>push</span><span>:</span>
  <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> master <span>]</span>

<span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
<span>publish-gh-pages</span><span>:</span>
  <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> ubuntu<span>-</span>latest
  <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/checkout@v2
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/setup<span>-</span>node@v1
     <span>with</span><span>:</span>
        <span>node-version</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span>
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm ci
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> git config user.name "&lt;user name<span>&gt;</span>" <span>&amp;&amp;</span> git config user.email "user email"
     <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm run deploy
     <span>env</span><span>:</span>
        <span>GH_TOKEN</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span>secrets.SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN<span>}</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This script is pretty self-explanatory, it performs the following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It specifies to work only on <code>push</code> on <code>master</code></li>
<li>Sets up a <code>node 12</code> environment</li>
<li>Installs dependencies via <code>npm ci</code></li>
<li>Sets up git requirements for username and email (required to do a push to branch)</li>
<li>Run the deploy script</li>
<li>In case you don’t use gh-pages npm package, you can write another step for git push to gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>At last, we set up env variable <code>GH_TOKEN</code> from our action secret (which you set up in step 3), this env variable would be available in <code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>
<center><strong>Step 5 </strong></center><br>
Commit this file and see your first <code>action</code> in action (sorry for the pun 🙈 )
<hr>
<center>Hope this helps 🙏🙏🙏</center>
<hr>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can see the actions running here: <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;/actions</code>.</li>
<li>Workflow file for <a href="https://itsopensource.com/">itsopensource.com</a> can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/tsl143/itsopensource/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages-publish.yml">here</a>.</li>

<p>To make a default Vim installation more useful, type the following 5 lines into its <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hls
set ic
set is
set nu
set noswf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or if you prefer, copy and paste the spelled out and annotated version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set hlsearch    " highlight all search results
set ignorecase  " do case insensitive search 
set incsearch   " show incremental search results as you type
set number      " display line number
set noswapfile  " disable swap file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For what it’s worth, the acronym for the 5 lines is <code>HIINN</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410751" target="_blank">Multiple people on HN</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25410742" target="_blank">have pointed out</a> that the 5 lines can be combined into a single line like below. I didn’t know about this capability, but will definitely start doing this from now on:</p>



<p>Also, as mentioned below, this is for temporary environments where you read more than you edit. For your local set up, it’s better to take the time to properly maintain the config file and install plugins as needed.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> is a powerful text editor for Unix/Linux, and I use it frequently to view and edit files. Unfortunately, Vim’s default configurations lack several important usability features compared to popular alternative text editors, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VSCode</a>.</p>

<p>The undesirable defaults are not an issue on my own computer, as I can take the time to configure them. However, often I’d find myself debugging or reading logs on near-fresh Linux installations (eg. virtual machines spun up to do integration testing), where Vim had not yet been configured.</p>

<p>So over time, I distilled the text editor features that I needed the most, and came up with the list above. To set it up, I would run <code>vim ~/.vimrc</code>, manually enter those 5 lines in whichever order that I remembered them, then quit and restart Vim to pick up the new configurations.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The first 4 lines are straightforward - most popular modern text editors already come with all of them out of the box. The last one could be controversial, since <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/recover.html#swap-file" target="_blank">swap file</a> is designed to help users recover work. In practice though, I find it to be more in the way, due to the additional dialogue that pops up when opening a file that has an existing swap file. The recovery feature itself is also not useful to me, as I more often read logs rather than make edits in those cases.</p>

<p>The next time you find yourself in a similar situation, I recommend you to also try putting those 5 lines into the <code>.vimrc</code>. It could make your Vim experience just a bit better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently saw these two videos about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8RkArhtCc4">discrete fourier transform (DFT)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7apO7q16V0">discovering the fast fourier transform (FFT)</a> and I got re-inspired to experiment with the FFT algorithm again.</p><p>If you’re not sure what a Fourier Transform is or you’re not sure how the DFT or FFT algorithms work, then check out the videos above.</p><p>If you’re not so keen on videos, or don’t have the time, I’ll try to briefly explain it.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-fft">What is the FFT?</h2><p>Before covering FFT, let’s first talk about what the Fourier Transform is. It takes an input from ‘signal space’ and converts it to ‘frequency space’. What does that mean? Take a look at the following graphs</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/pure.png" alt="pure sine wave and frequency"></p><p>This shows a simple sine wave, and its frequency can be seen in the spike in the frequency space graph, not so interesting yet.</p><p>However, if we were to make our signal a bit more complex, by layering 3 different sine waves on top of each other, we see that the Fourier Transform is still able to extract the unique frequencies</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/noisy.png" alt="pure sine wave and frequency"></p><p>There’s a lot more that the Fourier Transform can do, check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">wikipedia article</a> to learn more.</p><p>The Fast Fourier Transform is a very efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform.</p><h3 id="wait-what-is-the-discrete-fourier-transform">Wait, what is the discrete fourier transform?</h3><p>I’ve skipped a bit about the fourier transform, but it’s defined as the following complex integral.</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/ft.svg" alt="fourier transform integral"></p><p>This is a continuous operation and impractical to work with real world data in a computer. Instead, we want a version which works on discrete data.</p><p>Instead, we can turn the integral into a finite summation</p><p><img src="https://conradludgate.com/fft/dft.svg" alt="discrete fourier transform"></p><p>and the same properties will apply. The issue with this formula is that it will have a complexity of <code>O(n^2)</code>. This means that the run time will quadruple as the input length doubles. This is a big deal for sound processing. Typical audio is sampled at 44,100 times per second. This would need 1,944,810,000 calculations for analysing just a second of audio.</p><p>However, because of the symmetric properties of the fourier transform, there happens to be a clever trick we can do. We can split the input, apply the DFT to each half, then combine them. We can do the same trick to these smaller signals. This takes the complexity all the way down to <code>O(n log n)</code>. This theoretically brings the calculations required for the 44100 sample signal down to ~ 680,000. That’s almost 3000 times faster.</p><p>Here’s what the FFT algorithm looks like written in python (using numpy)</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>fft</span>(xs):

</code></pre></div><h2 id="how-can-we-speed-this-up-some-more">How can we speed this up some more?</h2><p>As far as I am aware, there’s no way to speed up the algorithm further than <code>O(n log n)</code>, so instead, we have to use some programming optimisations.</p><p>I’m going to be writing this implementation in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust</a>. Don’t worry too much if you’re not familiar, I’ll explain it as we go.</p><p>The first thing which I want to optimise is the recursion. Recursion is useful and clever and provides very simple solutions to some complex problems, but it ends up being quite slow. Every time you call a function, you push more data onto ‘the stack’. The stack controls the data that you will be using regularly. This includes the input variables, any new variables you create in the function, as well as where you will return to once the function is done. This adds up quite considerably with recursive functions.</p><p>How can we possible make this non-recursive? It turns out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function">most simple recursive functions</a> can be written iteratively. Let’s dry run out FFT above with a small input to see what happens</p><ol><li>Let’s take the input <code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]</code> with <code>n = 8</code>.</li><li>First, we split input in half. We get <code>es=[0, 2, 4, 6]</code> and <code>os=[1, 3, 5, 7]</code>.</li><li>We then apply the FFT to <code>es</code>. <code>n = 4</code></li><li>We split the input in half again, <code>[0, 4]</code> and <code>[2, 6]</code> respectively.</li><li>We then apply FFT again to <code>[0, 4]</code>, now <code>n = 2</code>.</li><li>Again, we split this in half, <code>[0]</code>, <code>[4]</code>. Since these are our base cases, we can stop here.</li><li>Now that they’re split, we can combine the two outputs.</li></ol><p>Ok, let’s pause here. We split the input in half 3 times before getting down to the base case, then we combine them back up again at the end. Let’s try something different.</p><h3 id="splitting-the-input">Splitting the input</h3><p>Let’s instead try to split up the entire input before doing any combining.</p><ul><li><code>[0, 2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5, 7]</code></li><li><code>[0, 4], [2, 6], [1, 5], [3, 7]</code></li><li><code>[0], [4], [2], [6], [1], [5], [3], [7]</code></li></ul><p>We can then combine them back up just the same as before. We might notice though that we’ve not actually required any more space. We’ve just re-arranged our input. Let’s zip it up back into a single array</p><p><code>[0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7]</code></p><p>Much simpler. The even terms will just be moved to the left side and the odd terms will be moved to the right.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what we have so far.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// This code splits the input in two

This is a little more interesting, we get <code>[1.0, 1.41-1.41i, -i, -1.41-1.41i]</code>. Conveniently, the values for the smaller <code>m = 4</code> case are interspersed in the values for <code>m = 8</code>. This simplifies it a lot for us since we can calculate just a single array of our <code>z</code> values, and use them for all of the <code>combine</code> calculations.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Perform the combine step in-place

<h2><a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">JUMP STRAIGHT INTO THE ILLUSTRATION APP</a></h2>

<p>Neural networks are often regarded as difficult to understand or interpret. Visualising their functionality and how they learn is challenging and has driven many research and engineering pursuits. In this blog post, we will take a step back from complex and high-dimensional domains (such as natural images). Instead, we structure a fairly simply problem that is neatly visual in order to interrogate some properties of neural networks.</p>

<p>It is typically not useful to consider the elementary components (neurons) that constitute neural networks individually. From layer to layer, it is the weighted linear aggregation of inputs and adjustments (biases) that gets fed into a non-linear activation function. This particular combination of inputs dictates how a neuron makes use of its activation function. For the purposes of this post, we will only consider the ReLU:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/relu.svg" alt="ReLU" width="100%"></p>

<p>where the non-linearity boundary is marked with the red circle. Despite being a simple function - the maximum of zero or the input - the ReLU class of non-linearities is widely used. It is usually not the activation function that allows a neural network to model complex functions, but rather the interaction between all the processing elements. In this post we will study both the complex interplay between neurons at different layers as well as single neurons themselves. We do this by inspecting the non-linearity boundary (the red circle, above) over an entire data-domain. As you can imagine, a simplified and illustrative data domain is necessary for this. A similar set-up was used <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/image_regression.html">here</a> to paint images.</p>

<h2 id="the-set-up">The set-up</h2>

<p>To visualise the interaction between a domain of data and neurons we consider as inputs pixel locations of an image. <strong>No, not an image, but rather individual (x, y) pixel locations (normalised between [0, 1] for simplicity).</strong> The predicted probability output of the neural network answers: is this pixel black or is this pixel white? We set this up as a classification task for simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="the-network">The network</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/network_diagram++.svg" alt="Network diagram" width="100%"></p>

<p>This neural network has three hidden layers, each of which have sixteen neurons. It was trained by minimising the cross-entropy loss over 1,270,000 iterations, each of which consists of a randomly selected minibatches of 128 pixel locations. We used the Adam optimiser with its default hyperparameters, and gradually reduce the learning rate to zero using cosine annealing.</p>

<p>The entire data-domain <strong>is the image on the left</strong>. Therefore, the function that this neural network is modelling <em>can be visualised and interpreted by processing all pixel locations</em> to produce something like the image on the right. Note that the above predicted visualisation is for demonstrative purposes: the network does do better than this!</p>

<h2 id="the-demonstration">The demonstration</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/ginn.html">This web application</a> demonstrates how the neurons in this network behave throughout learning. There are three ‘good’ runs that converged satisfactorily and one ‘bad’ run that failed to model the central diamond. Feel free to head over there and play around with this tool. Analysing a single neuron’s non-linear boundary throughout training gives an intuition for how these elements coalesce into powerful function approximators.</p>

<p>When selecting a neuron to visualise, what you see is the non-linear activation boundary defined by the ReLU function: when it moves from a region in data-space that triggers the activation to be on or off. Stacking these non-linear boundaries can be interpreted as inducing a more finely granulated interpretation of the data space from which to make decisions. To visualise this, take note of how the later layers can branch off earlier layers to create more complicated line intersections - this is easier to see when selecting only one neuron to visualise in the last layer and finding its contributing intersectors in the layers preceding it.</p>

<p>All too often it can be difficult to understand just what neural networks are learning, how they arrive at a converged state and solution, or where they put their ‘energy’ (i.e. decision making power, in this case). What this visualisation offers is an attempt to give an intuitive grasp as to how layers in a neural network interpret the data domain.</p>

<p>Training the neural network with different seeds generates unique demonstrations (<a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good2.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">3</a>, and <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/bad1.html">4</a>). There are three ‘good’ results and one failure case to choose from. After playing with the demo you might notice some intriguing phenomena. First, lets take a look at a full sweep of one of the good runs:</p>

<h3 id="all-non-linear-boundaries-for-a-training-run">All non-linear boundaries for a training run</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/sweep.gif" alt="Full sweep" width="80%"></p>

<p>The background represents the predicted probability of a white pixel. The blue lines are the first layer’s non-linear boundaries, the red lines are the second layer’s non-linear boundaries, and the green lines are the third layer’s non-linear boundaries. Notice how the blue lines can only ever be a straight line across the data space itself, while the red lines can diverge off the blue lines, and the green lines off both the red and blue lines.</p>

<h3 id="bias-shift-before-weight-shift">Bias shift before weight shift</h3>

<p>Changing the bias term for any given neuron translates into shifting a line without changing its slope, while a change of incoming weights alters the slop of a line. Visualising the early stages of learning in <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">one of the training runs</a> reveals that the bias terms are readily and quickly adjusted before weight changes play any significant role (for layer 1, here):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/bias.gif" alt="Bias versus weights" width="80%"></p>

<p>Before the <strong>pause</strong> the bias changes dominate, and <strong>thereafter</strong> the weights are adjusted to change the slope of the lines. This is also true for deeper layers (<a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">go see for yourself</a>) and even seems to happen over multiple instances during training.</p>

<h3 id="layer-dependences-at-critical-points">Layer dependences at critical points</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/dependence.gif" alt="Critical points" width="80%"></p>

<p>First, note how the latest layer (green, layer 3) can deviate off both earlier layers even though it is not connected to the earliest layer (blue, layer 1). Second, note how the critical points in the data are strongly correlated with deviation points when <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">the network</a> reaches convergence.</p>

<h3 id="copycats">Copycats</h3>

<p>Different neurons sometimes have identical jobs. This is obviously inefficient, but sometimes difficult to avoid. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">In this case</a>, two neurons (layer 3, neurons 2 and 6) in the final layer converge to a very similar state:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/same.gif" alt="Copycats" width="80%"></p>

<h3 id="the-indecisive-neuron">The indecisive neuron</h3>

<p>Sometimes neurons converge to a state where small shifts in the loss cause large changes in their decision boundaries:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/indecisive.gif" alt="Indecisive" width="80%"></p>

<p>This was taken toward the end of <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good1.html">one of the training runs</a> (layer 3, neuron 4), where the learning rate was close to zero (since it was cosine annealed). This behaviour does not seem to change the predicted output much, nor is it obvious how knowing it occurs could be useful, but it is interesting to witness, nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="leveraging-symmetries-in-the-data">Leveraging symmetries in the data</h3>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/symmetry.png" alt="Leveraging symmetry" width="80%"></p>

<p>When the network leverages the (obvious, to us) symmetries in the data, the output prediction becomes better: individual neurons can multitask. The above image demonstrates the difference between two converged networks. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html">The better network</a> (top row) does a better job at predicting the data and the non-linear boundaries in all layers exhibit some left-right symmetry inherent in the data. <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good2.html">The worse network</a> (bottom row) does not capture the data symmetry nearly as well.</p>

<h3 id="a-bad-run">A bad run</h3>

<p>Finally, lets take a look at a <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/bad1.html">training run</a> that resulted in a bad reconstruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/bad.gif" alt="Poor thing" width="80%"></p>

<p>It is unclear what goes wrong in this case to result in this poor reconstruction. It might be that the earlier layers do not find the natural symmetry of the data, or that the initialisation results in later layers favouring certain neurons in earlier layers, thus bounding them within regions that are not useful for modelling the central diamond shape. It is interesting, however, to compare how much better this network does at modelling the top of the bottle:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/images/goodvsbad.png" alt="Good versus bad" width="80%"></p>

<p>Suppose we made this network deeper and/or wider - it may be able to devote more energy to the bottle top while still adequately modelling the central diamond.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are many more hidden gems in these illustrations. I hope that this post has been both educational and inspiring. Go <a href="https://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/ginn.html">play/work/explore</a>.</p>

            <p>Earlier today, I had the misfortune of reading a blog post about the dangers of the decentralized web and how we should not partake in or encourage it's development. Hacker News had a pretty <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25312854" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">active discussion</a> about the post.</p><p>Ideological takes on this always turn ugly, and I'm at a point in my life where I avoid that at all costs. I can only talk about my preferences about the world, not about how things ought to be, implying some sort of inherent value or divine moral good.</p><p>Here's what I prefer: a world where ideas, no matter how silly or dangerous, are allowed to be expressed, shared, ignored, attacked and laughed at. I don't imagine a world like this can ever exist easily, but a more decentralized web can help us get halfway there.</p><h3 id="ok-so-what-about-gurlic-then">Ok so what about Gurlic then?</h3><p><a href="https://gurlic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Gurlic</a> is roughly just over two months old now, and at a point where I am relatively comfortable with the basic features it has. In the coming weeks and months, I want to focus on modifying the backend to either adopt an existing decentralized protocol, or think about how to approach writing a new one. Perhaps it would have been smarter to do this before building it first, but that would have limited how I envisioned Gurlic to be and it would've turned out differently.</p><p>Right now I'm looking into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">activitypub</a> spec, and the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">matrix</a> spec - here are some initial thoughts I have about how Gurlic should approach decentralization/federation.</p><ul><li><p>Decentralization can be a priority, but must never be promoted as a feature, or made to be a selling point. When decentralization becomes the main selling point of a product or service, the usability and polish tend to suffer. Not always, but nearly always. None of the marketing copy should include the words 'decentralization', 'privacy' etc. <strong>Normal users don't care about any of this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>User experience should be seamless. The user shouldn't have to generate a key, remember an extra password, remember weird URL schemes, or download utilities and clients just to be part of an online community or to write an article. Above all, the user must not be confused, as one usually is when looking at Mastodon instances, which one to sign up to, and so on. My mom should be able to use it without having to call me, just like she does with Facebook. <strong>Normal users do care about this</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The protocol must be flexible enough to allow for all of Gurlic's current features. This means communities, user profiles, publications, articles, galleries, rich media posts, sharing/responding and so on. All seamlessly without any rough edges.</p></li><li><p>Any and all cryptocurrency/blockchain must be avoided.</p></li></ul><p>I'll have more to write about this in the near future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>San Francisco was poised to make a big improvement in its central transit system: the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org/index.html"><em>Better Market Street</em></a> plan. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_(San_Francisco)">Market Street</a> is one of the major transit arteries of the city, the route that people ride to commute from the Mission and the Haight to downtown.</p><p>It’s also a high-injury corridor, and the city aimed to fix that by creating a grade-separated bike lane and lots of new and improved infrastructure.</p><p><img alt="Better market plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-better-market-plan.png"></p><p>After years of community input and design, the plan was to introduce a separate lane for bikes, sidewalk improvements, separated lanes for buses, and more. It was pretty inspiring.</p><p><img alt="Post-pandemic revised plan" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-post-pandemic-revised-plan.png"></p><p>But the budget collapse caused by COVID-19 scaled back the project radically, and now we’re considering sharrows instead of separated bicycle lanes. The plan includes what you see above: a double-wide lane where bicyclists perilously “share the road” with taxis, delivery trucks, and city vehicles. It’s what we call <a href="https://bummermarketstreet.com/">Bummer Market Street</a>.</p><p>So I decided to look into the main anti-feature of this plan for cyclists: the sharrow.</p><h2

particular symbol that combines a bicycle icon with an arrow or house icon. Initially, the bicycle was <em>inside</em> the arrow, like it was in a little house, but recently it’s next to the arrow.</p><p>Sharrow symbols are painted on streets or applied with thermoplastic decals.</p><p>The purpose of a sharrow is to <em>encourage good bicyclist and driver behavior</em>. Sharrows don’t increase legal penalties for drivers or cyclists. They encourage cyclists to take the lane, but cyclists are permitted to do that anyway, on any narrow street. Sharrows are supposed to make motorists aware of cyclists. When drivers kill people in sharrows, there aren’t any additional consequences.

lanes from car traffic” would improve cycling “a great deal”, more than any other change. Columbus, Ohio asked in 2008 what infrastructure cyclists would want to see, and 85% of respondents referred to bicycle lanes, with only 76% seeing a benefit to shared-use paths.</p><p>Bicycle advocacy organizations also don’t want sharrows: the new Better Market Street plans were <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">immediately panned by the SF Bicycle Coalition</a>.</p><h3 id="do-sharrows-inform-drivers-of-the-presence-of-bicyclists">Do sharrows inform drivers of the presence of bicyclists?</h3><p>We have a few sources of data here.

Since the sample size of drivers was so small, the results do not provide conclusive findings. -p13</p></blockquote><p>Do drivers understand the markings?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists that responded, two out of the seven that noticed the markings understood that the marking indicate that they should allow more room for cyclists. p14</p></blockquote><p>There’s a study from Brookline, MA. Do drivers notice markings there?</p><blockquote><p>Of the motorists surveyed, only 21% noticed the markings and were at least 70% confident that the markings indicated a preferred zone for bicycling.</p></blockquote><p>Casual observations from Warren Vermont:</p><blockquote><p>Casual verbal survey of approximately 200 local citizens and 50 bicyclists led to conclusion that bicyclists felt the symbols were too small to be effective and local drivers rarely noticed them. The Vermont DOT decided to not encourage their use, to not replace them, and to not include them in future plans</p></blockquote><p>Do cyclists understand the symbols? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp1gN8xsz3o">Here’s a news report about how they don’t</a>.

Proxies to safety are measured: cyclists riding in the center of the lane, in the right direction, not on sidewalks, and sometimes the distance from cars to bikes. The Texas study does an impressive amount of statistical reasoning about passing events &amp; horizontal positioning on the street. But actual safety is not rigorously measured.</p><p>The one study that directly studies the effectiveness of bicycle sharrows <em>for safety</em> is called <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1393928"><em>The Relative (In)Effectiveness of Bicycle Sharrows on Safety Outcomes</em></a>. It’s a quick read, but the killer line is:</p><blockquote><p>Results suggest that not only are sharrows not as safe as bike lanes, but they could be more dangerous than doing nothing at all.</p></blockquote><p>This probably isn’t the question you care about, right? Proper horizontal positioning isn’t one of the <a href="https://www.visionzerosf.org/">Vision Zero SF</a> goals. Bicyclists don’t talk that much about proper horizontal positioning.</p><p>But nevertheless: proper horizontal positioning is one of the key goals of sharrows. Three of the five goals outlined in the MUTCD are different kinds of proper horizontal positioning. The first goal of San Francisco’s study was horizontal positioning. Most of the sharrow-related data collected is about horizontal positioning.</p><p>As Ferenchak &amp; Marshall note, there is mixed evidence for horizontal positioning in correctly-painted sharrows.</p><p>Amusingly, though, there are a lot of sharrows that don’t even encourage cyclists to take the center of the lane, because they’re painted in the “door zone”: exactly the area that cyclists are supposed to stay away from.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Door-zone sharrow in Chicago" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-04-sharrows-door-zone-sharrow-in-chicago.jpg"></picture></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/38067633996">A sharrow in Chicago that has been painted exactly in the 'door zone' which sharrows are supposed to keep bicycles out of / photo by Eric Fischer</a></figcaption><h2 id="why-dont-sharrows-go-away">Why don’t sharrows go away?</h2><p>I’m not the first to point out the uselessness of sharrows. The In(effectiveness) study by Ferenchak and Marshall got airtime on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/01/14/study-sharrows-dont-make-streets-safer-for-cycling/">Streetsblog</a> and <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/article/sharrows-shared-lane-markings-street-cyslists-may-hurt-help/">99 Percent Invisible</a>. The bicycle coalition immediately <a href="https://sfbike.org/news/the-fights-not-over-for-a-better-market-street/">opposed San Francisco’s new sharrows</a>. Ferenchak and Marshall <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2046043018300583">expanded their research with additional data</a>.</p><p>One defense of sharrows is that they’re <em>part of a larger strategy</em>: why not have all the tools in the toolbox?

Sure, you have it now, but it’s not going to do anything.</p><h2 id="how-sharrows-snuck-into-transportation-planning">How sharrows snuck into transportation planning</h2><p>Sharrows started as a brutal compromise. The creator of the sharrow, James Mackay, essentially said that it was a bare-minimum way to do <em>something</em> for cycling in a city that didn’t want to do anything:</p><blockquote><p>Part of it was the city of Denver’s reluctance to do much of anything for bicycles. So I figured, this would be a less expensive approach versus the conventional bike lane markings. A lot of the agencies don’t want to do anything involving change or spending money for bicycles. I was always under pressure to do less as the Denver bicycle planner.</p></blockquote><p>In this form, as a temporary measure in the evolution of cities away from cars, sharrows made sense.</p><p>And sharrows <em>are</em> successful, to some degree, at encouraging cyclists to avoid the “door zone.” And those small, measurable improvements in ‘horizontal positioning’ bought the sharrow’s way into transit device standards.</p><p>Then cities started pushed sharrows in all sorts of scenarios that needed bike lanes, not a temporary, toothless symbol on the asphalt. And since they’re cheap and don’t disrupt car traffic, they caught on.</p><p>But sharrows have overreached and underperformed. Any …</p></div></div>

<p>There are so many programming language but only a few really appeal to the
majority of developers, hence their popularity (most used) and community size
explosion. Popular languages have more hands on deck hence their
<a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/accumulative-advantage/">Accumulative Advantage</a>:
more developers -&gt; more ideas -&gt; more contributions -&gt; more tools -&gt; more
third-party packages -&gt; more corporate support (because most of these developers
work for companies) -&gt; more apps -&gt; repeat. This very advantage gives birth to
many more advancement to the language and it’s ecosystem. As more and more
people build their businesses and tools around the language, they are
incentivize to continuously invest their engineering resources and money to
improve the overall ecosystem. Think about it 🤔</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s my point in relation to D?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> is a unique but still familiar language. It has almost
all the attributes suited for a mainstream programming languages. It’s
statically typed but still manages to be fluid and easy to write code in like
any dynamically typed language. It’s got all the powerful features I’ve seen in
any other language out there, either comparably similar or better. Moreover,
it’s got some of the most brilliant people behind it. This is why I’ve gone as
far to write several articles about why D is great for development including
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development">this one on OpenSource.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why isn’t D mainstream?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So first of all you may ask, why is it even necessary to be mainstream or
“popular”? Isn’t staying small and nimble how we can attract quality over
quantity?</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment to an extent but the cost definitely outweighs the
benefit. When a larger community is well managed with clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals, they can accomplish more. <strong>Clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals</strong> ahh? Yep. That’s one of the key missing
ingredients of the D community even as small and nimble as it is. Despite the
clever language design and seemingly promising direction, D lacks in the soft
side. This is what I believe holds the grow and adoption of the language back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft skills… the people and organizational things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a-train-with-no-destination">A train with no destination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The roadmap of the D language is still very unclear and the project page on
GitHub has not been updated for over a year. See
https://github.com/dlang/dmd/projects</li>
  <li>There’s little to no communication of language objects and mobilization of
the community to reach certain milestones. There’s almost no organizational
side to the
<a href="https://dlang.org/foundation/about.html">D Language Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why do I still use D?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>D is technically the best out there for me. It’s the only modern system
programming language with a clean and familiar syntax.</li>
  <li>It’s very powerful and capable of solving any domain problem: web
development, network applications, system development, scripting, gaming,
etc. This is rare because almost every language out there is either suited
for one thing or the other.</li>
  <li>It’s got a package system. Unless you’ve got infinite amount of time on a
project, you’ll need to use code others have written to solve similar
problems you may have. D makes it easy to discover such packages from
<a href="https://code.dlang.org/">it’s package repository</a>. Almost all modern
language have similar centralized package repositories.</li>
  <li>A great community. D has got one of the best communities I’ve ever seen. The
community is very welcoming and helpful. The only thing we lack now is
mobilization and direction.</li>
  <li>It keeps getting better. D has consistently improved over the years that
I’ve been in the community. Yes, it moves at a slow pace but it doesn’t
invalidate the fact that things keep getting better.</li>
  <li>It can be better. Comparatively, D heavily lacks in community organization,
leadership communication, development tools, third-party packages,
user-friendly documentation, learning resources, onboarding experience and
general ecosystem polish. These can make D unappealing for certain projects
with the need for a matured ecosystem. However, this can be made better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this year comes to an end, I hope the D Language Foundation and community
revisit past mistakes and look for way to make things better. I am here to stay.</p>

    <p>Since 2014 when <a href="https://subreply.com/">Subreply</a> was launched as Sublevel, I always wanted for users to specify their location. After years of programming in Python I found a way to validate <strong>City, Country</strong> and <strong>Country</strong> formats in a simple and intuitive way.</p>

<h4 id="the-code">The code</h4>

<p>The first part of the problem is to have all data available so you can match the user input with the expected output. I do this by fetching world cities from Simplemaps as a hashmap or Python dictionary. There are some corrections applied to city and country names. I wanted a Django management command so I can run it every time Simplemaps update their public dataset.</p>

<p>Loading JSON in memory as a Python dictionary is straight forward. Validating user input against an <strong>country: [cities]</strong> hashmap is simple as well. First you validated the country and then you validated the city is part of that country.</p>

Let’s get started.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><ul><li id="282c"><strong>On-device: </strong>The most powerful argument for on-device solutions is the latency—the whole process is performed on the phone and doesn’t necessitate communication with an external/remote API. There is also the argument of <strong>privacy.</strong> Since everything happens on-device, there is no data transferred from the phone to a remote server. A cloud-based API can be risky in terms of an entity being in the middle of the communication, or the service provided being able to literally store images for other reasons than the advertised intent.</li><li id="2298"><strong>Built-in: </strong>They are many ways to use/create on-device models that can be, in some cases, better than Apple’s built-in solution. Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/ios" rel="noopener">ML Kit</a> provides an on-device solution on iOS for Face Detection (in my experience, similar to Apple’s in terms of accuracy), which is free and has more features than Apple’s solution. But for our use case, we just need to detect faces and draw bounding boxes. You can also build your own <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/face-recognition-and-detection-on-ios-using-native-swift-code-core-ml-and-arkit-feed10c468da?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">model using Turi Create’s object detection API</a> or any other framework of your choice. Either way, you still need a huge amount of diverse and annotated data to come even close to Apple’s or Google’s accuracy and performance.</li></ul><p id="84d8">Apple has been active in providing iOS developers with powerful <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/whats-new-in-the-vision-framework-in-ios-14-73d22a942ba5">APIs centered on computer vision</a> and even other AI disciplines (i.e. <a rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/processing-tweets-on-ios-using-natural-language-and-create-ml-8a4390868ddb">NLP</a>). They have continuously improved them by trying to represent the complex spectrum of use cases,<strong> from gender differences to racial diversity</strong>. I remember the first version of the Face Detection API being very bad at detecting darker skinned faces. They have since improved it, but there is <strong>no perfect system</strong> so far, and detection is <strong>not</strong> 100% accurate.</p></div></div></section><section></section><section><div><div><p id="a902">To get us started, we first need to create a helper class that handles multiple use cases for face detection. This helper class could be reused in any project that is using Apple’s built-in API for the same. My approach with this class is to create a series of static functions capable of returning specific values for different scenarios.</p><p id="472f">I started by creating an enum <code>Faces</code> variable that would be helpful to store whether there are no faces, one face, or multiple faces. This could become handy when you perform different actions depending on the number of faces in an image.</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="3f20">AppleFaceDetection Class</h2><p id="3e8c">This will be our main class for everything related to Apple’s Face Detection Vision API.

This object contains various information, such as confidence, landmarks, or the bounding box. This is the main function used in this project to blur faces.</li></ul><figure><div></div></figure></div></div></section><section></section><section><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6528/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png" width="3264" height="726" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1080w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2700/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1350w, https://miro.medium.com/max/3240/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1620w, https://miro.medium.com/max/3780/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 1890w, https://miro.medium.com/max/4320/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 2160w, https://miro.medium.com/max/4800/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png 2400w" sizes="100vw" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*rJopKfUNIJUSxWZ_enJnQQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Figure 2: Create a new Single View Application</figcaption></figure></div><div><div><p id="af1a">Now we have the ML side of our project ready to go.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I suspect that the Venn diagram of people who own both an M1 Mac and a Surface Pro X is small. I fall into that section in the middle, so I thought it was worth summarizing how the two compare.</p>



<p>I should say from the start that the Surface Pro X is by far and away my favourite Windows device. I also have a Surface Book 3, which is a pretty powerful laptop in its own right, but which I just don’t love as much.</p>



<p>The hardware design of the Surface Pro X is exceptional, and it is one of the few non-Apple devices that I’ve owned which matches Apple’s level of industrial design. Using an ARM processor with its much less hefty thermal requirements than Intel chips has freed Microsoft’s hardware designers to make the Surface that they have clearly always had in their heads. It’s thin and light, with an exceptionally lovely screen, and in my experience it just never gets hot, something that I can’t say of any Intel-based computer I’ve ever used.</p>



<p>For some categories of user, myself included, the performance is actually good. Performance is a relative thing: what’s acceptable for someone who lives in the browser would be glacial for a designer who spends their life in Photoshop.</p>



<p>My work life is solidly in Office 365 and a browser, and for this kind of work–which we should remember is a huge chunk of users across the globe—the Surface Pro X is perfect. Office and Edge have never felt slow, no matter how many tabs or documents I have open. And the ability to use it anywhere thanks to built-in LTE makes it more useful than a conventional laptop.</p>



<p>My M1 Mac mini is… well, it’s a Mac. It does everything I have ever used my Macs for, including audio and video editing, and subjectively does it as well and as fast as anything I’ve ever used. It feels faster than my year old 16in MacBook Pro, which has double the memory and on paper at least ought to be easily quicker. And it does it while being silent, cool and snappy with everything.</p>



<p>Using it with third party hardware has also been a very Mac-like experience. Whatever third party hardware I have plugged in has worked from an old Logitech webcam to a Blue Yeti USB mic. Even the software which allows me to programme my Corsair gaming mouse works perfectly. I don’t even know if it’s running ARM or Intel code.</p>



<p>That’s the crucial difference between the two devices. You don’t have to think about the Mac mini as anything other than a Mac. With the Surface Pro X you need to remember that it’s not a Windows device, it’s an ARM Windows device, and limit what you can do accordingly. If your requirements sit within those limitations, it’s a great machine. If they don’t, you won’t be able to use it at all.</p>



<p>This is why Microsoft’s marketing language about Windows on ARM devices focuses on how they are “a new category of PC” and why it talks about the Surface Pro X as for “mobile professionals”. The company isn’t confident—rightly—that ARM devices can replace an Intel PC except in those specific circumstances. Apple thinks of the M1 as making the Mac just a better Mac, first for low-end customers where it can deliver performance that’s already close to the top end, and in 2021 and 2022 for its most demanding users.</p>



<p>What can Microsoft do? I honestly don’t think there’s much it can, at the moment. To get to where Apple is, Microsoft needs to persuade Qualcomm that it should devote time and effort to build chips optimised for higher thermal envelope devices, such as laptops and desktops. That’s not as easy as it sounds. It also needs to persuade Qualcomm that building in features to make it easier to emulate or translate Intel code is worth the effort.</p>



<p>On the software side, it also needs to sort out the mess that is Windows development. Windows Presentation Foundation, Universal Windows Platform, Progressive Web Apps… the entire system is a mess that makes it harder, not easier, to choose how to develop for Windows. This is something that Apple has been very good at managing in the past.</p>



<p>Can Intel or AMD keep up? Apple is already a larger processor company than either of them in terms of units shipped, thanks to its wholly owned designs for the A- and no M-series. Combine iPhone and iPad and Apple ships more than 250m devices per year. Most of those devices will share a great deal in terms of processor design as the M1, meaning that the Mac gains from the economy of scale and design cost amortisation that Intel can only dream of. There are of course big differences between an M1 and an A14, but they share the same cores, the same Neural Engine, the same image processing and secure enclave designs. Perhaps over time the high performance cores in iPhone and Mac will diverge, but at the moment Apple doesn’t need to do it, so it can benefit from being able to design one processor core which ships in 250m devices a year—more than the number of PCs shipping over the same time scale.</p>



<p>I think all this adds up to Microsoft and Intel being in a bigger boatload of trouble than most people think. The shift to ARM feels like a classic Clay Christiansen transformational technology moment, with M1 the tipping point when a technology moves from cheaper but not as powerful as the incumbent to beating it. The path that Microsoft and Intel must take is a radical rethinking of their own businesses, and I am not clear that the internal forces in either company have accepted that yet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-view-of-the-keyboard-on-my-table.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="View of the keyboard on my table" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-view-of-the-keyboard-on-my-table.jpg"></picture></p><p>Nobody needs this keyboard. If you want to type, all you need is a laptop. The <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K2</a>, <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/k380-multi-device.920-007558.html">Logitech K380</a>, or Apple Magic Keyboard will work if you keep your laptop closed.</p><p><a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus">The Atreus</a> is a keyboard for experimentation and fun. It sits in the intersection of four trends:</p><ul><li><strong>Columnar</strong>: the keys are in straight rows, not staggered.</li><li><strong>Minimal</strong>: no number keys, arrow keys, or symbol keys.</li><li><strong>Ergonomic</strong>: the layout is split into two angled halves with a gap in the middle.</li><li><strong>Mechanical</strong>: the keys are louder and move further than modern laptop keyboards.</li></ul><p>The Atreus started as a <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">handmade kit</a> designed by <a href="https://technomancy.us/colophon">Phil Hagelberg</a>. This version of it is produced by <a href="https://shop.keyboard.io/pages/about">Keyboardio</a>, a pair of engineers who redesigned the Atreus into something that could be produced at scale and with mass-market level fit &amp; finish.</p><p>I’ve been using the Atreus part-time for the last few months, and it’s just what I hoped for. The learning curve is steep but achievable. My hands feel pretty good when I use it. I think it’s more ergonomic than my usual keyboard. Plus it’s simply cool and fun to use.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-showing-how-flat-the-keyboard-is.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="showing how flat the keyboard is" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-showing-how-flat-the-keyboard-is.jpg"></picture></p><p>As a novelty device, it’s important that the Atreus feels solid. And it does, even though it’s very small. It’s heavy enough, with no wobbles or gaps in construction. With weight as a sort of metric, I can see keyboards gaming it. My Keychron has an aluminum case that adds to the weight, but there are visible gaps and mismatches in its manufacturing.</p><h3 id="the-learning-curve">The learning curve</h3><p>Like other tiny keyboards, there’s a big learning curve for the Atreus. There are basically three big things to learn:</p><ol><li>There are way fewer keys, so you have to press the “Fun” key to access things like numbers and symbols.</li><li>With the split, letters like T, G, B, Y, H, and N belong to your left or right hand and you can’t “cross.” So if you previously typed “B” with your right hand, you’ll have to retrain yourself to type it with your left.</li><li>With the compact layout, there are no extra-bit keys like the space bar or tab key on a traditional keyboard.</li></ol><p><img alt="legend" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-legend.png"></p><p>The biggest challenge for me is #2: it’s hard to remember which hand types which keys. That’s also the biggest problem with switching back to traditional layouts: I’ll stretch to type “B” with my left hand because that works on the Atreus, but it doesn’t make that much sense on a traditional keyboard.</p><p>I owned a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou/description">Keyboardio Model 01</a> before, and though I was never able to adjust to its layout, the changes that it required to my typing were positive even for traditional keyboards. These isolinear keyboards make it harder to do suboptimal bad habits like typing the letter ‘p’ with your ring finger instead of your pinky - and once you learn to switch, it feels better overall.</p><p>Then there are the layers. Memorizing layers is a challenge, but the accessibility of special keys isn’t that different from a standard keyboard. Instead of typing Shift-1 to get a ! symbol, you type Super-Q. The additional layer of keys is a pain to get to and navigate out of, but it isn’t necessary for any <em>input</em> keys, only for keys like play/pause media controls.</p><p>Where this kind of keyboard tends to succeed or fail is the design of its “thumb cluster”. Whereas a traditional keyboard has a huge space bar which is the main key you hit with your thumbs, these tiny keyboards have tiny space bars and expect you to do a lot more with your thumbs. I struggled to make the thumb cluster on the Keyboardio Model 01 work, but the one on the Atreus is really convenient - there’s only one row of keys for your thumbs and they’re tightly packed in with the rest of the keys.</p><h3 id="the-keys">The keys</h3><p>I followed the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus">Kickstarter campaign</a> for this keyboard, like I did for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/the-model-01-an-heirloom-grade-keyboard-for-seriou/description">Model 01</a>, so I read all about some of their challenges producing these things. Hardware is hard. They tried lots of different processes to produce durable keys for this keyboard and eventually landed on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyboardio/atreus/posts/2909332">etching symbols instead of printing them</a>.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-etched-keys-on-the-atreus.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="etched keys on the Atreus" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-12-12-atreus-etched-keys-on-the-atreus.jpg"></picture></p><p>This decision turned out really well. The keys look cool, are super durable, and you feel the legends just a bit. The keys are opaque and this keyboard isn’t backlit, which works out perfectly fine: when I find myself working in the dark, I should usually stop working.</p><hr><p>Anyway, nobody needs this thing, but it’s a lot of fun and it’s a really nice object. There’s a significant learning curve, but that’s part of the appeal for some of us: learning new and maybe-better ways to type gives us the same feeling as learning to ride a bike. Learning to ride a fixed-gear bike can let you relive that experience (but it’s ridiculous and niche), and learning how to type on a tiny keyboard can too, with the same caveats.</p><p>I think the Atreus is ideally positioned as a fun alternative keyboard. It’s different from a normal keyboard, but not so different that the learning curve is brutal, it’s small enough to fit on your desk as you cycle between it and a traditional keyboard, and it’s less expensive than a Kinesis Advantage, Ergodox, or Moonlander.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Have you ever worked with classes that are thousands of lines long? Those classes end up encapsulating tens of related functionality, and you end up repeating that class’ name many times, like in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>

</ul>

<h2 id="inspiration-for-this-article">Inspiration for This Article</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this article comes from my recent mass cleanup of our test framework at the office. Like many other complex system developers, we have our custom test framework to do all sorts of automated end-to-end testing, simulating real user interactions with our apps on real devices. I can’t show the code, but it has been neglected for several years now. While modernizing it, I also decided to refactor it to use chainable methods, just as you would expect from modern test frameworks. The resulting code was exceptionally clean and developer-friendly, and it was well worth the time investment. Before diving into specifics, let me summarize what method chaining is for you.</p>

<h2 id="method-chaining">Method Chaining</h2>
<p>Method chaining is an idiom in object-oriented languages where an object’s methods return a reference to the object itself. This way, method calls can be chained together, without requiring variables to store the intermediate method call results.</p>

<p>Imagine a database object. To be able to use it for the first time on an empty database, you first need to connect to your database then initialize it. In code, it would be like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not too bad. You only have to reference the database object twice. But imagine if you could chain these calls:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>).</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much nicer isn’t it. And it will become much better in situations where it saves you 5-6 object references. If you like, you can put each method call on a new line so it will be easier to use debug-points. Here is an example using Python syntax:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I find method chaining to be an excellent utility for classes with lots of small and relevant functionality. Objects encapsulating database queries, test code, and UI code are great examples of this. Now let’s go ahead and investigate the implementation of our database class from the previous example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DB</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In its current shape, you cannot chain the methods in this class. It is an easy fix, though. All we have to do is to finish each method with a “return self” statement so each method will return a reference to the object itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>DB</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>close</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span># todo
</span>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can safely chain the methods in our database class. As you might have realized, any function that needs to return something other than the object itself won’t be chainable.</p>

<p>Method chaining can also be used to build a fluent interface or implement the builder pattern, which allows you to craft large objects or even SQL queries through a chain of methods. If you want to read more on the subject, I have links to several Wiki articles for them in the resources section above. Now let’s analyze the benefits and drawbacks of method chains.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-and-drawbacks">Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
<p>The benefit of method chaining is obvious; cleaner and concise code. You don’t have to keep repeating calls to same objects for consecutive operations on the same object, which is especially useful in repetitive code like test code. You also don’t need to create temporary variables to store results from previous method calls. However, this will make it difficult to put debug points on the right method in the chain. To get around this limitation, you can separate each method call with a new line, or add a chainable <code>breakpoint()</code> method, or just put debug point on the whole statement and do step-in/step-out. Some programming language debuggers already support adding debug points on methods in the chain directly.</p>

<p>One interesting side effect of method chaining is that it will make logging harder. You normally put logging code in between method calls like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>log</span><span>.</span><span>info</span><span>(</span><span>'Initializing the database.'</span><span>)</span>
<span>db</span><span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you switch to method chaining, you might add a simple chainable log method to your class to work around the problem:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>'postgresql://localhost/testdb'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>log_info</span><span>(</span><span>'Initializing the database.'</span><span>)</span> \
    <span>.</span><span>initialize</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, method chaining is not a silver bullet, but for where it fits, it brings conciseness and clarity, which I always like. In my experience, tests and data filtering and manipulation code are prime candidates for method chaining. Next time you are going to implement a framework or a utility class, you can provide chainable methods to make life easier for the prospective users of that code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>readers</span>
  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>p</span><span>.</span><span>folowed_me_on_twitter</span> <span>===</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

What I do is completely different, more sacred, honest and open and yes sometimes flawed. Sometimes I hide the fact that I have a Ph.D. because I don’t want it to be a symbol of authority or intelligence for myself. It also feels douchey to tell people I have a Ph.D. I want to be judged by my actions, not where I went to school, which can be primarily determined by your parents financial status and education level. I grew up on a farm in rural Indiana. We ate eggs from our chickens and drank dehydrated milk. Up until even high school my family was dirt poor. We had our electricity shut-off and had to take cold showers. When we couldn't afford the phone bill, I walked to 7-11 and used the payphone to call my friends. Violence, evictions, car repossessions — you name it, I’ve lived it. Starting undergrad at SIU I was homeless and lived out of my car and slept on the dorm room floors of people I knew.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was in graduate school, 99% of my peers did not come from a similar background. It was abundantly clear that the practice of science and medicine is only accessible to the upper crust. That’s an issue in itself, but the <b><i>f</i></b><i><b>ucking humongous gigantic bigger problem</b></i> is that cutting-edge medicines are also only available to the societal elite. Time and time again throughout this pandemic, we’ve watched as the wealthy and powerful get all the unapproved drugs to treat their covid, while all of us peasants sit back and do our best not to die without them. The 108 Regeneron antibody cocktails all went to Washington DC.</p><p>That’s why I left academia. Why I quit my job at NASA and started doing science as a biohacker. I want everyone to be able to do science without any gatekeepers. The single greatest impediment to diversity in science is access to knowledge and information that is being held tighter than Ric Flair’s Figure Four Leg Lock.</p><p><b><span>Biohackers are setting knowledge free.</span></b></p><p>In May 2020, an article came out in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806">science magazine</a> where researchers showed that by using a DNA vaccine that codes for the SARS-COV2 spike protein, they could create antibodies that provide protection from covid-19 in macaque monkeys without harmful side-effects. Getting good monkey data is basically the best pre-human data you can ever hope to get. Most people only have experimental data from mouse tests. When I see a paper like this the gears in my brain begin to spin because there is a good chance the FDA would approve this for human testing.</p><p>So, I decided to test it myself. The project perfectly fit a niche where biohackers have an experimental advantage over academia and industry. With enough knowledge and skill, we could perform quick but data-laden experiments to show whether the same DNA vaccine tested on monkeys would be promising in humans. And instead of taking months or years we could have results in as little as a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>I brought up the idea with David Ishee and Dariia Dantseva, fellow members of the biohacking group the <a href="http://the-cdc.com/" target="_blank">Central Dogma Collective (CDC)</a>. They also thought that based on the data this would be a fucking crazy project. We decided <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAhY1w2w78rSeNQo_e0dQ2w8mmGEg7Mr">we would live-stream</a> every step so that people could learn how to do advanced biomedical research like this in their own home. If one were to replicate the experiment from scratch, the total individual cost would end up being around $3500, the major costs being $1600 for DNA synthesis and $1200 for the kits to measure coronavirus spike protein antibodies.</p><p>What I really wanted was to show people how to do the science. I didn't really care if it worked or not but I tend to be pessimistic about my own experiments anyway. While testing and creating a successful coronavirus vaccine would send a powerful message to the world, teaching people how to do advanced biomedical research will change it.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the experiment worked. All three of us developed SARS-CoV2 spike protein neutralizing antibodies. I still can't fucking believe it. Not only did we create and test a successful vaccine, we showed that we could get a gene therapy to work (a DNA vaccine changes the DNA in your cells and so is a gene therapy also). <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTuRBuy74KlaBzLrd0aTZl852nhPNCWL06aB7wY1JKk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here is a summary of the experimental details and results</a> if you are interested. We didn't create the vaccine to sell it. We made the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SracILuRbiZt4f7EVH2JBvefaHmsOUsC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">nucleotide sequence and genetic design data open and free</a> so that anyone can easily recreate it. All in a state-of-the-art lab. I'm kidding, my lab is a tiny bedroom in a house in West Oakland, David's is in a shed in rural Mississippi and Dariia's is an old building she converted in Ukraine. If your mind isn't blown, you either already knew about the project or you don't understand what I just told you.&nbsp;</p><p><b><span>If you want to know why I created and tested a coronavirus vaccine on myself, it’s because I am at War.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p>I know it sounds a bit dramatic but there really is a class war going on. There is a group of people who are actively making choices that cause a disproportionate amount of deaths among those in lower social classes. New gene therapies cost over a million dollars. That’s right. Your life, your child’s life, your mother, your loved one depends on how much money you make. The government and Pharma companies aren’t going to help you when you can’t afford it either. Most of these gene therapies aren't even available outside the US either because most countries with socialized medicine won't pay for them. So don't tell me how your country's healthcare is better.</p><p>Considering that if you are reading this there is a 99% chance you are not part of the top 1%, let me ask you this — why are we letting the wealthy and powerful get away with this?&nbsp;</p><p>Those who have a monopoly on the understanding and use of biotechnology have all the power. If I, if we can teach people how do it themselves then we win back power.</p><p>This is why biohackers are needed in society.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in Dec. 2020, many people are still holed up waiting for a vaccine. The problem is when a vaccine for covid comes around it won't be the 99% that receive it first. Your life isn't worth that much. You're not important or wealthy or powerful. The people who will receive it first are the same people who can sit out a pandemic in the comfort of their home and have their necessities delivered by the working class. They tell everyone else to social distance and wear a mask but won’t do it themselves. Fucking Gavin Newsom.</p><p>Still, we are losing this class war as people continue to fight against their best interest. They believe lying politicians, lying scientists, and are manipulated by the news media. We are told to wait and trust while hundreds of thousands of people in the US die. While small businesses close at an unprecedented rate, but large corporations make billions.</p><p>What the fuck. They are killing us and taken what we own. Why are we still putting up with this?</p><p><b><span>We can take back what belongs to us by creating for ourselves.&nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>Science and medicine belong to us not them.&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Biohack the fucking planet</span></b></p>

I think of 1-on-1s as my primary tools for connecting with an individual and working on their morale, engagement, productivity and growth.</p><p>I usually like to find out if my report wants to lead the conversation. You might start with a simple question. Do you have an agenda or something that's on your mind? If not, then I think about which one of the major points below I want to get into.</p><p>These are the high level areas I like to hit, and I've listed some relevant questions/prompts with each one. This isn't meant to be comprehensive, and it's not meant to be a script. I like my 1 on 1s to be more organic and I'll jump around these topics depending on how the conversation goes.</p><h2>How are you doing? (every 1-on-1)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. How's your project going?<br>&nbsp; 2. Are you struggling with anything?<br>&nbsp; 3. Can I help you knock down any barriers?<br>&nbsp; 4. Are there places I can step in and help facilitate communication with others?</p><h2>I've got some feedback for you. (Positive or negative. As often as needed)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. I've observed these things you've been doing<br>&nbsp; 2. I've gotten this input from people you've worked with<br>&nbsp; 3. This is how you did on recent projects<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk about this scenario where you did good/needed improvement</p><h2>Let's talk about what's happening around the org. (At least once a month. Definitely when significant changes have happened.)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Can I address any recent changes that you're curious or concerned about?<br>&nbsp; 2. Can I address any rumors or things that worry you?<br>&nbsp; 3. Let me tell you what the leadership team has been talking about that may affect you.<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk about the wider org direction and make sure you're connected to what our business goals are.</p><h2>Let's talk about your career path. (Once a quarter at least. You can do this in smaller more frequent iterations too)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Let's set some goals for the next few months<br>&nbsp; 2. Let's check in on the goals we set for you<br>&nbsp; 3. How can I create opportunities for your growth?<br>&nbsp; 4. Let's talk specifics on what's going to get you to the next level<br>&nbsp; 5. Let's talk more long term. Where do you wanna be in a few years?</p><h2>Let me tell you my thoughts on the direction of the team. (How often you do this depends a lot on your team and how your company operates)</h2><p>&nbsp; 1. Here's what I think the priorities are for our team right now.<br>&nbsp; 2. Here's where I think we're doing well and where we have challenges.<br>&nbsp; 3. I'd like to get your opinions on these things and talk about where I think you can help move things forward.</p><p>Keep in mind that there is an implicit number zero here which is connecting on a personal level. Ideally I'm always building rapport and trust throughout 1-on-1s and in other scenarios. I find time to talk about family, recent events, hobbies, future plans, etc. I'll sometimes even let this conversation take up significant time in the 1-on-1. I don't like to make people feel rushed or that there's always something intense that we need to talk about.</p><p>There is some initial onboarding into 1-on-1s. The first several are going to be about getting to know my new report and finding out what they need from me. That requires some more targeted information gathering. Here’s a great post by Lara Hogan that focuses on that. <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/">Questions for our first 1:1</a></p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In recent years GraphQL has really taken off as a pattern/library/type system. It offers much which REST does not and its standardisation and flexibily has really helped in its adoption. When I began looking for a detailed explanation of how graphql works internally I struggled to find anything which was not too high-level. I wanted to see how the schema, query, types and resolvers all worked together mechanically.</p>
<p>Its not possible to focus on all parts in detail in this article so I have focused on the <b>execution</b> part of the query lifecycle.</p>
<p>This is part of my <a href="https://craigtaub.dev/introducing-my-under-the-hood-of-series">"under-the-hood of" series</a>:</p>

</ul>

</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-overview"><a href="#1-overview" aria-label="1 overview permalink"></a>1: Overview</h2>
<p>First we need to ask what is graphql? There are a couple of answers</p>
<p>It is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A type system - type definitions define how data should look. They are written to show what is included and highlight the relationships (how things relate). This system definition language can be transformed into AST.</li>
<li>A formal language for querying data - what to fetch from where.</li>
<li>Rules for validating or executing a query against the Schema.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point (3) above references the official <b>Specification</b> which defines the rules for types, validation and executing the schema. It can be found at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://spec.graphql.org/">spec.graphql.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a documentation-friendly website <a href="https://graphql.org/learn">graphql.org/learn</a></p>
<p>All languages follow the spec, and the JS <code>graphql</code> library frequently references part of it. We will be looking at that library as part of this section.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-schema"><a href="#building-the-schema" aria-label="building the schema permalink"></a>Building the schema</h3>
<p>Building the schema is important part for a graphql application, as mentioned above it defines all types and their relationships. There are 2 steps to this</p>
<h4 id="1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast"><a href="#1-parses-schema-notation-usually-found-in-a-schemagraphql-file-into-ast" aria-label="1 parses schema notation usually found in a schemagraphql file into ast permalink"></a>1. Parses "schema notation" (usually found in a <code>schema.graphql</code> file) into AST</h4>
<p>The parser will throw errors if it is not a GraphQL schema. See snippet from <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/schema.js#L52">types/schema.js</a> (below)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>isSchema</span><span>(</span><span>schema</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>instanceOf</span><span>(</span>schema<span>,</span> GraphQLSchema<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances"><a href="#2-transform-ast-into-objects-and-instances" aria-label="2 transform ast into objects and instances permalink"></a>2. Transform AST into objects and instances</h4>
<p>We need a schema which is a type instance of <code>GraphQLSchema</code> (see above snippet). We then need objects inside the schema which match types, for example a scalar or an object.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/definition.js#L575">Example of a scalar</a> (below snippet)</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> OddType <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLScalarType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>"Odd"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>value <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>===</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> value
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The native scalar types defined for GraphQL are <code>ID</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>String</code> and <code>Boolean</code>. You can define your own inside your type system.</p>
<h4 id="summarise"><a href="#summarise" aria-label="summarise permalink"></a>Summarise</h4>
<p>Essentially for building the schema we turn this graphql schema notation:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>type</span> Book <span>{</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>ID</span><span>!</span>
  title<span>:</span> String
  authors<span>:</span> <span>[</span>Author<span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Into this Javascript</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> Book <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLObjectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Book'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span>
    id<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLNonNull</span><span>(</span>GraphQLID<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    title<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLString</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    author<span>:</span> <span>{</span> type<span>:</span> <span>new</span> <span>GraphQLList</span><span>(</span>Author<span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Almost all of the GraphQL types that you define will be object types. Object types have a name, but most importantly describe their fields.</p>
<p>A <code>GraphQLSchema</code> looks like the below in raw POJO form:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>GraphQLSchema {
  astNode: {
    kind: 'SchemaDefinition',
    ...
  },
  extensionASTNodes: [],
  _queryType: Query,
   ...
  _typeMap: {
    Query: Query,
    ID: ID,
    User: User,
    String: String,
    ...
  },
  ...
}</code></pre></div>
<p>It holds AST information too but the root Query and types are found under the <code>_typeMap</code> property.</p>
<h4 id="adding-resolvers"><a href="#adding-resolvers" aria-label="adding resolvers permalink"></a>Adding resolvers</h4>
<p>Resolvers cannot be included in the GraphQL schema language, so they must be added separately.</p>
<p>They are added to the <code>_typeMap</code> property, under <code>_typeMap.&lt;Type&gt;._fields.&lt;field&gt;</code>
So after adding the resolvers, a schema object might look like below:</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code> _typeMap<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
   Query<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> users<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
   User<span>:</span> <span>{</span> _fields<span>:</span> <span>{</span> address<span>:</span> <span>{</span> resolve<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>function</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From the HTTP request side the community has largely standardized on a HTTP POST method. But what happens when the server receives a query?</p>
<h3 id="query-lifecycle"><a href="#query-lifecycle" aria-label="query lifecycle permalink"></a>Query lifecycle</h3>
<p>The GraphQL spec outlines what is known as the "request lifecycle". This details what happens when a request reaches the server to produce the result.</p>
<p>There are 3 steps that occur once the lifecycle is triggered.</p>
<h4 id="1-parse-query"><a href="#1-parse-query" aria-label="1 parse query permalink"></a>1. Parse Query</h4>
<p>Here the server turns the query into AST. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lexical Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's Lexer identifies the pieces (words/tokens) of the GraphQL query and assigns meaning to each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntactic Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>GraphQL's parser than checks whether the pieces conforms to the language syntax (grammar rules)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If both these pass the server can move on.</p>
<p>In <code>graphql-js</code> this is all found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/language/parser.js#L137">parser.js</a> file and function.</p>
<p>This query:</p>
<p><code>query homepage { posts { title author } }</code></p>
<p>Becomes the AST</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"kind"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Document"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"definitions"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>

<p>You can see this for yourself on <a href="https://astexplorer.net/">astexplorer</a> under GraphQL.</p>
<h4 id="2-validate-query"><a href="#2-validate-query" aria-label="2 validate query permalink"></a>2. Validate Query</h4>
<p>This step ensures the request is executable against the provided Schema. Found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/validation/validate.js#L36">validate.js</a> in the <code>graphql-js</code> library.</p>
<p>While it is usally run just before execute, it can be useful to run in isolation. For example by a client before sending the query to the server. The benefit is that the validator could flag an invalid query before it is sent to the server, saving a HTTP request.</p>
<p>It works by <em>checking each field in the query AST document against its corresponding type definition in the schema object</em>. It will compare argument type compatibility as well as coercion checks.</p>
<h4 id="3-execute-query"><a href="#3-execute-query" aria-label="3 execute query permalink"></a>3. Execute Query</h4>
<p>This step is by far the most intensive and the step I often found the most confusing in its mechanism. We will be digging deeper into this step in part 2, so lets look at the process involved from a high-level.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the operations i.e. a query or mutation? (several queries can be made at once)</li>
<li>Then resolve each operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For step (2) each query/mutation is run in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="resolving-each-operation"><a href="#resolving-each-operation" aria-label="resolving each operation permalink"></a>Resolving each operation</h5>
<p>For step 2 GraphQL iterates over each field in the selection-set, if it is a scalar type resolve the field (<code>executeField</code>) else recurse the selection-sets until it resolves to a scalar.</p>
<p>The way this works is that the engine calls all fields on the root level at once and waits for all to return (this includes any promises). Then after reading the return type it cascades down the tree calling all sub-field resolvers with data from the parent resolver. Then it repeats this cascade on those field return types. So simply speaking it calls the top-level Query initially and then the root resolver for each type.</p>
<p>The mechanism caled "scalar coercion" comes into play here. Any values returned by the resolver are converted (based on the return type) in order to uphold the API contract. For example a resolver returning string "123" with a number type attached to it will return <code>Number("123")</code> (i.e a number).</p>
<p>This is found under the <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/dd0297302800347a20a192624ba6373ee86836a3/src/execution/execute.js#L103">execute.js</a> file and function inside <code>graphql-js</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly the result is returned.</p>
<h3 id="introspection-system"><a href="#introspection-system" aria-label="introspection system permalink"></a>Introspection system</h3>
<p>Its worth mentioning the introspection system. This is a mechanism used by the GraphQL API schema to allow clients to learn what types and operations are supported and in what format.</p>
<p>The clients can query the <code>__schema</code> field in the GraphQL API, which is always available on the root type of a Query.
Any interactive GraphQL UIs rely on sending an <code>IntrospectionQuery</code> request to the server, which builds documentation and auto-completion with it.</p>
<h3 id="libraries"><a href="#libraries" aria-label="libraries permalink"></a>Libraries</h3>
<p>As part of my research I covered many different libraries, so I thought it was worth giving a quick overview of the main ones in the JS ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="graphql-js"><a href="#graphql-js" aria-label="graphql js permalink"></a><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">graphql-js</a></h4>
<p>The reference implementation of the GraphQL spec, but also full of useful tools for building GraphQL servers, clients and tooling.
It's a GitHub organisation with many mono-repositories.</p>
<p>It performs the entire Query Lifecycle (including parsing schema notation).</p>

<p>Requires library specific <code>GraphQLSchema</code> instance. In order to be an executable schema it requires resolver functions.</p>

</ul>

<p><em>Summary: <code>ParseNumberF64</code>, <code>StringToDouble</code> and similarly named functions take
a string like <code>"12.5"</code> (one two dot five) and return a 64-bit double-precision
floating point number like <code>12.5</code> (twelve point five). Some numbers (like
<code>12.3</code>) aren’t exactly representable as an <code>f64</code> but <code>ParseNumberF64</code> still has
to return the best approximation. In March 2020, Daniel Lemire
<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">published</a>
some <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser">source code</a> for a new,
fast algorithm to do this, based on an original idea by Michael Eisel. Here’s
how it works.</em></p>

<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>

<h3 id="fallback-implementation">Fallback Implementation</h3>

<p>First, a caveat. The Eisel-Lemire algorithm is very fast (<a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/">Lemire’s blog
post</a>
contains impressive benchmark numbers, e.g. 9 times faster than the C standard
library’s <code>strtod</code>) but it isn’t comprehensive. There are a small proportion of
strings that are valid numbers but it cannot parse, where Eisel-Lemire will
fail over to a fallback <code>ParseNumberF64</code> implementation.</p>

<p><strong>The primary goal is speed, for 99+% of the cases, not 100% coverage</strong>. As
long as Eisel-Lemire doesn’t claim false positives, the combined approach is
both fast and correct. <em>Update on 2020-10-08: To be clear, combining with the
fallback means that Eisel-Lemire-with-the-fallback is (much) faster than
just-the-fallback, for ‘only’ 99+% of the cases, but <strong>still correct for 100%
of the cases</strong>, including subnormal numbers, infinities and all the rest.</em></p>

<p>If falling back to <code>strtod</code>, know that it can be sensitive to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator">locale-related</a> environment
variables (i.e. whether twelve point five is <code>"12.5"</code> or <code>"12,5"</code>). Discussing
fallback algorithms any further is out of scope for this blog post. <em>Update on
2020-11-02: the Simple Decimal Conversion fallback algorithm is discussed in
<a href="https://nigeltao.github.io/blog/2020/parse-number-f64-simple.html">the next blog post</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="notation">Notation</h3>

<p>Let <code>[I .. J]</code> denote the half-open range of numbers simultaneously greater
than or equal to <code>I</code> and less than <code>J</code>. The lower bound is inclusive but the
upper bound is exclusive.</p>

<p>Let <code>[I ..= J]</code> denote a closed range, where the upper bound is now inclusive
and its the constraint is now “less than or equal to”.</p>

<p>Let <code>(X ** Y)</code> denote <code>X</code> raised to the <code>Y</code>th power. For example, here are some
different ways to write “one thousand”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3</code></li>
  <li><code>1000</code></li>
  <li><code>10 ** 3</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, here are some different ways to write “sixty four”:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>0x40</code></li>
  <li><code>64</code></li>
  <li><code>2 ** 6</code></li>
  <li><code>1 &lt;&lt; 6</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Exponents can be negative. <code>(10 ** -1)</code> is one tenth and <code>(2 ** -3)</code> is one
eighth.</p>

<p>Let <code>A ~MOD+ B</code> denote modular addition, where the modulus is usually clear
from the context. For example, working with <code>u8</code> values would use a modulus of
<code>256</code>. <code>(100 + 200)</code> would normally be <code>300</code>, which overflows a <code>u8</code>, but <code>(100
~MOD+ 200)</code> would be <code>44</code> without overflow. In C/C++, for unsigned integer
types, the <code>"~MOD+"</code> operator is simply spelled <code>"+"</code>.</p>

<h3 id="double-precision-floating-point">Double-Precision Floating Point</h3>

<p>In C/C++, this type is called <code>double</code>. Go calls it <code>float64</code>. Rust calls it
<code>f64</code>. We’ll use <code>f64</code> in this blog post, as well as <code>u64</code> for 64-bit unsigned
integers and <code>i32</code> for 32-bit signed integers.</p>

<p>Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">double-precision floating
point</a>
article has a lot of detail. More briefly, a 64-bit value (e.g.
<code>0x40840000_00000000</code>) is split into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 sign bit: here, <code>0x0</code>, meaning non-negative</li>
  <li>11 exponent bits with a 1023 bias: here, <code>0x408 - 1023 = 9</code></li>
  <li>52 mantissa bits and, for normal numbers, an implicit 53rd bit set on: here,
<code>0x40000_00000000</code> is implicitly <code>0x140000_00000000</code> whose 53 bits, in
binary, is <code>0b10100_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000_00000000</code>,
interpreted as <code>((1*1) + (0*½) + (1*¼) + (0*⅛) + etc) = 1.25</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Let <code>AsF64(0x40840000_00000000)</code> denote reinterpreting those 64 bits as an
<code>f64</code> bit pattern. Its value is therefore <code>(1.25 * (2 ** 9))</code>, which is <code>640</code>
in decimal. An equivalent derivation starts with <code>0x00140000_00000000 =
5629499534213120</code> and then <code>(5629499534213120 &gt;&gt; (52-9)) = 640</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code> and <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000001)</code> are
<code>9007199254740992</code> and <code>9007199254740994</code> in decimal, also known as <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) +
0)</code> and <code>((1&lt;&lt;53) + 2)</code>. The integer in between, <code>9007199254740993 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) +
1)</code>, is not exactly representable as an <code>f64</code>. Relatedly, the slightly smaller
<code>9007199254740991 = ((1&lt;&lt;53) - 1)</code> is also known in JavaScript as
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER"><code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code></a>.</p>

<p>The sign bit (corresponding to a leading <code>"-"</code> minus sign in the string form)
is trivial to parse and we won’t spend any more time discussing it.</p>

<p>Non-normal numbers include subnormal numbers (with a biased exponent of
<code>0x000</code>) and non-finite numbers (with a biased exponent of <code>0x7FF</code> and whose
value is either infinite or Not-a-Number). We similarly won’t spend much time
on these.</p>

<h3 id="round-to-even">Round To Even</h3>

<p>Typically, when rounding a decimal fraction to an integer, <code>7.3</code> rounds down to
<code>7</code> and <code>7.6</code> rounds up to <code>8</code>. Rounding numbers like <code>7.5</code>, half-way between
two integers, is subject to more debate. One option is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding">rounding to
even</a>, alternating between rounding
down and up:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>70.5</code> rounds to <code>70</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>71.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>72.5</code> rounds to <code>72</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>73.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li><code>74.5</code> rounds to <code>74</code>, rounding down</li>
  <li><code>75.5</code> rounds to <code>76</code>, rounding up</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Properly parsing <code>f64</code> values similarly rounds to even: the evenness of the
least significant bit of the 53-bit mantissa. This isn’t necessarily the same
as rounding the overall value to an integer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>9007199254740990</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x433FFFFF_FFFFFFFE)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740991</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x433FFFFF_FFFFFFFF)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740992</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740993</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740992 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000000)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740994</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000001)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740995</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740996 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740996</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740997</code> rounds to <code>9007199254740996 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000002)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254740998</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000003)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254740999</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741000 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li><code>9007199254741000</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254741001</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741000 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000004)</code>,
rounding down</li>
  <li><code>9007199254741002</code> is exactly representable as <code>AsF64(0x43400000_00000005)</code></li>
  <li><code>9007199254741003</code> rounds to <code>9007199254741004 = AsF64(0x43400000_00000006)</code>,
rounding up</li>
  <li>etc</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="static-single-assignment">Static Single Assignment</h3>

<p>For clarity, this blog post presents the Eisel-Lemire algorithm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">Static
Single Assignment</a>
form. For example, a separate <code>AdjE2_1</code> variable is defined below, based on
<code>AdjE2_0</code>, instead of destructively modifying a single <code>AdjE2</code> variable over
time. Implementations are obviously free to use a more traditional imperative
programming style.</p>

<h3 id="multiplying-two-u64-values">Multiplying Two <code>u64</code> Values</h3>

<p>Some compilers (and some <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mul">instruction
sets</a>) provide a built-in <code>u128</code>
representation for multiplying two <code>u64</code> values without overflow. When they
don’t, it’s <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/internal/cgen/base/fundamental-public.h#L457-L469">relatively
straightfoward</a>
to implement with <code>u64</code> operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each <code>u64</code> is split into a high and low 32 bits.</li>
  <li>The four cross-pairs are multiplied (without overflowing a <code>u64</code>).</li>
  <li>The four overlapping <code>u64</code> values are re-assembled into a <code>u128</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pre-computed-powers-of-10">Pre-computed Powers-of-10</h3>

<p>The smallest and largest positive, finite <code>f64</code> values, <code>DBL_TRUE_MIN</code> and
<code>DBL_MAX</code>, are approximately <code>4.94e-324</code> and <code>1.80e+308</code>. We’ll pre-compute two
approximations, called the <em>narrow</em> (low resolution) and <em>wide</em> (high
resolution) approximations, to each power-of-10 in a range, such as from
<code>1e-325</code> to <code>1e+308</code> inclusive. Implementations can <a href="https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser/issues/28">choose a smaller
range</a>, discussed in
the <code>Exp10</code> Range section below.</p>

<p>For each base-10 exponent <code>E10</code>, the narrow approximation to <code>(10 ** E10)</code> is
the unique pair of a <code>u64</code>-typed mantissa <code>M64</code> and an <code>i32</code>-typed base-2
exponent <code>E2</code> such that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The high bit of <code>M64</code> is set: <code>M64 &gt;= 0x80000000_00000000</code>.</li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &gt;= ((M64 + 0)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) &lt;  ((M64 + 1)   * (2 ** E2))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>&gt;=</code> in the first condition is <code>==</code> when the approximation is exact. When
inexact, the approximation rounds down (truncates). Whether exact or not, the
residual <code>R64</code>, defined as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(10 ** E10) =  ((M64 + R64) * (2 ** E2))</code> or, equivalently,</li>
  <li><code>R64 = ((10 ** E10) / (2 ** E2)) - M64</code></li>
</ul>

<p>implies that <code>R64</code> is in the range <code>[0 .. 1]</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s an exact example, for <code>1e3</code>, also known as <code>(250 * 4)</code> or <code>(0xFA &lt;&lt; 2)</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e3    = (0xFA000000_00000000 * (2 ** -54))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an inexact example, for <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   ≈ (0xE596B7B0_C643C719 * (2 **  79))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, these two numbers bracket <code>1e43</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719 &lt;&lt; 79) =  9999999999999999999741184793924429452148736</code></li>
  <li><code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C71A &lt;&lt; 79) = 10000000000000000000345647703731744039501824</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>(0xE596B7B0_C643C719, 79)</code> pair represents an inclusive-lower
exclusive-upper bound range for <code>1e43</code>.</p>

<h3 id="look-up-table-columns">Look-Up Table Columns</h3>

<p>The narrow powers-of-10 look-up table has two columns for each <code>E10</code> row: <code>M64</code>
and <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code>. The <code>NarrowBiasedE2</code> value is <code>E2</code> plus a <code>NarrowBias</code>
constant (the magical number <code>1150</code>)  which is discussed later.</p>

<p>The wide approximation is like the narrow one except its mantissa <code>M128</code> is 128
bits instead of 64.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1e43   = (0xE596B7B0_C643C719_6D9CCD05_D0000000 * (2 **  15))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The wide powers-of-10 look-up table splits <code>M128</code>’s bits in half to have three
columns: <code>M128Lo</code>, <code>M128Hi</code> and <code>WideBiasedE2</code>. For the <code>1e43</code> example, these
are <code>0x6D9CCD05_D0000000</code>, <code>0xE596B7B0_C643C719</code> and <code>(WideBias + 15)</code>. The
last two columns are shared with the narrow look-up table (<code>M64 = M128Hi</code> and
<code>WideBias = NarrowBias + 64 = 1214</code>) so that a single table holds both the
narrow and wide approximations.</p>

<p>The powers-of-10 look-up table is generated by <a href="https://github.com/google/wuffs/blob/ba3818cb6b473a2ed0b38ecfc07dbbd3a97e8ae7/script/print-mpb-powers-of-10.go">this Go
program</a>.
The two <code>u64</code> columns are explicitly printed, and the one <code>i32</code> column is
implied by a linear expression with slope <code>log(10)/log(2)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="eisel-lemire-algorithm">Eisel-Lemire Algorithm</h2>

<h3 id="manexp10-form"><code>Man:Exp10</code> Form</h3>

<p>Parsing starts by converting the string to an integer mantissa and base-10
exponent. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>"1.23e45"</code> becomes <code>(123    * (10 ** 43))</code></li>
  <li><code>"67800.0"</code> becomes <code>(678    * (10 **  2))</code></li>
  <li><code>"3.14159"</code> becomes <code>(314159 * (10 ** -5))</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="small-value-fast-path">Small-Value Fast Path</h3>

<p>If the mantissa is zero, then the parsed <code>f64</code> is trivially zero.</p>

<p>If the mantissa is non-zero but less than <code>(1 &lt;&lt; 53)</code> then it is still exactly
representable as an <code>f64</code>. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the challenges of a tech career is the necessity to stay up-to-date on technology advancements. A key part of your ability to solve business problems with technology is understanding how to use the latest advancements to create a solution. Therefore your value as an individual contributor or manager is partially driven by the amount of knowledge that you have cultivated during your life.</p><h2 id="technology-is-a-moving-target">Technology is a Moving Target</h2><p>Acquiring this knowledge isn’t easy. Over the last 30 years, information technology has advanced at a breakneck pace. Complexity has exploded as well. It’s certainly not possible for one person to know everything in tech. But it’s become impossible to have comprehensive knowledge even about a single technology product in many cases.</p><p>For example, take Microsoft SQL Server, a commonly used relational database. Early in my career, one of my areas of expertise was SQL Server. I learned how to install it, support it and troubleshoot it. I became proficient in writing queries in Transact-SQL, SQL Server’s query language. I learned how to performance tune queries and how to efficiently transfer data in and out of the database. At the time, that was pretty much everything I needed to know to be considered a SQL Server expert.</p><p>But that was in the early 90’s and SQL Server was about to explode in complexity. Microsoft acquired a few companies and integrated these new products into the SQL Server platform. A data warehousing engine was added with its own tools and query language. New capabilities were added to run highly available and scalable implementations like failover clustering and database mirroring. This added large new surface areas that SQL Server experts had to learn about.</p><p>Many of these new product features became their own categories of expertise. Instead of generalist SQL Server experts, we started seeing niche specializations like SQL Server data warehouse experts or a query tuning experts. When it became common to shift database workloads to the cloud, traditional SQL Server roles transformed even more radically.</p><p>This constant advancement of the tools we work with in tech forces us to frequently reframe our value proposition as a worker. A successful technology career will require lifetime learning to stay relevant.</p><p>Continuous career education is not an easy path. Although it can be difficult to keep up, the fact is that the more knowledge you have, the more value you can add to your employer in the modern business environment. Your knowledge becomes a competitive differentiator for you in the workplace. The more knowledge you have, the more likely it is you will get that new job or that promotion. This is somewhat unique to particular lines of work like technology, and obviously knowledge is not the only job skill you need. But in many tech jobs, knowledge is perhaps your greatest asset. You need to plan carefully to cultivate this knowledge.</p><h2 id="side-project-oriented-learning">Side Project-Oriented Learning</h2><p>It should be clear that effective career education cannot be a one-time event. Although a college education is still important, the skills you learn in those four years are not enough to sustain a forty year career. Learning needs to be continuous. In the modern world, knowledge has a shelf-life (as opposed to wisdom that stands the tests of time).</p><p>Successful tech workers have a process to learn about their field continuously. Often it’s not intentional but simply an enjoyable pursuit. Many software engineers love coding and learn through side projects. They identify new programming languages or tech stacks they would like to add to their resumes and work on related projects in their spare time. The side project becomes a form of training, just like elite military forces that train through simulated scenarios to develop their skills in a low-stakes setting.</p><h2 id="learning-at-work">Learning at Work</h2><p>The most effective learning will probably come from your 9-to-5 job. Your job is by far the most valuable source of education. This knowledge grows out of the trials and tribulations of real world scenarios. On-the-job training allows you to clearly see the impact of your successes and failures. You can observe how your work output affects your team and your employer’s results. The beauty is that you can learn not just from the effort that you put into a specific project, but also from the consequences your work has on the larger systems you are working within. You can’t easily get this contextual learning from individual side-projects.</p><p>If you write some poorly structured code on a hobby project, it’s likely you will never suffer the negative consequences. Therefore you won’t learn from it. But in a real work environment, your poor code will impact your team and your employer. This technical debt that you have created could slow your team members down and make them miss an important deadline. Or even worse, your code could cause a problem in production that affects customers and hurts your employer’s bottom line. You will be forced to confront the choices you’ve made in the past, and you will gain valuable experience correcting problems caused by previous mistakes.</p><p>Although unpleasant, these challenges are the fire that will forge your growth as an effective technology worker.</p><h2 id="choosing-the-right-job">Choosing the Right Job</h2><p>Don’t have a tech job yet? You can still apply the same mindset to whatever your current job or daily pursuits are. Even if you’re working as a barista or an Amazon driver, you are still presented with so many learning opportunities each day. You can learn how to deal with customers or coworkers, develop a deeper understanding of the software you use in your job, and overcome whatever mental challenges your job entails. No matter what you do on a daily basis, if you approach your day looking at each challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, you will find that over time you will develop the knowledge and discipline that will move your career forward.</p><p>When making decisions about a new job opportunity, it’s important to consider how much you will learn from the role. Many don’t think about this and choose jobs simply based on factors like company reputation, job title, or compensation. However working for a highly regarded company with a respected job title may not necessarily put you in a good position to learn the job skills you need to move forward in your current career path.</p><p>You want to look for jobs that offer knowledge content that aligns with your learning strategy, while at the same time provides enough challenge so that you will be pushed beyond your comfort zone. This is the recipe for a high-learning job situation.</p><p>Sometimes it will be necessary to move into a job at a smaller company with less salary to achieve this. Smaller companies can offer more variety in daily tasks since job descriptions are usually less siloed. If your goal is to learn about artificial intelligence and you are working at a large company doing something unrelated to AI, it will be difficult to get that exposure unless top management decides to create an AI team or project. Even then you will be competing with your coworkers to get involved.</p><p>At a smaller company, there is often more flexibility. Perhaps you have a general job like software engineer or business analyst and you work on your employer’s client-facing web applications. If you want to get exposure to artificial intelligence, it’s may be possible to work relevant projects into your day-to-day job. You can look for opportunities to use AI in a way that relates to the software you’re working with and determine how it could provide business value. Pitching a project with real business benefits to your boss can put you in a position to dabble with the technology you want to learn.</p><p>The key is to solve a real business problem. In the less-structured organization of a smaller employer, you can often achieve flexibility to work on the tech you’re interested in because there is a lack of standards and policies that you will find in a larger IT organization. Smaller IT teams usually have less need for top-down controls about programming languages, frameworks, third-party APIs, cloud services, etc.</p><p>These aren’t universal truths and it’s completely possible to find flexibility in large companies and a lack of autonomy in small companies. But it is a key consideration you should evaluate when you decide whether to accept a new job.</p><h2 id="maximizing-your-personal-learning-time">Maximizing your Personal Learning Time</h2><p>Outside of work or side projects, it’s important that you allocate some personal time to learn on a consistent basis. This personal learning will provide foundational knowledge for the tasks you perform as part of your job. For this learning, you might choose to read books, industry journals, blog posts, or tech vendor educational content. Podcasts and educational videos are also great sources of content. Everyone learns differently so you have to chose the media format that is most effective for you. Podcasts and audio books are great for learning while doing physical activity or commuting. Blogs or journals are great to read on your phone when you get a bit of free time. Reading books, especially technology or business content, requires a bit more focus and you should set aside time each day to eliminate distractions to do some deep reading and thinking.</p><p>Daily reading and study provides context and depth of understanding, but it becomes far more valuable when you can make connections between your personal learning and your work. I have found that I’m far more motivated to read a book or watch video training when it’s specifically relevant to a problem I’m currently trying to solve at work. The content becomes a clue in my search for a solution. Not only is it more compelling when the content is relevant but it makes it easier to retain information.</p><p>There will be other cases where you are drawn to a topic simply because you find it interesting. It may have absolutely no relevance with your current work or side projects. When something triggers your curiosity like this, by …</p></div></div>

The fact that we can invest the present moment to actualize a future vision is an astounding feature that drives the creative spirit. Because our minds are always a few steps ahead of our hands, there will never be a shortage of ideas that we are forever building toward.</p><p>However, this beloved feature of ours is also a bug.</p><p>The problem with developing visions is that it creates expectations. The moment we conjure a result in our minds, we tie ourselves to that result, and become attached to that idealized blueprint. We start thinking linearly, as we already know where we want this project to end up. The cost of certainty is usually curiosity, and that is one of the first things to go once an end goal is chased.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A02-B-Walking-along-single-path-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>But here’s the thing.</p><p>If you want to be productive with your work, you <em>must</em> have this sense of direction and expectation.

I acknowledge the importance of having a schedule, but chunking my creative time into slots on a calendar feels like I’m sacrificing the freedom required to unearth interesting ideas.</p><p>Oftentimes, being able to name the problem goes a long way, and I’d like to delineate between the two styles of thought here:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><span><strong>Focused Thought</strong></span> is what guides our work lives, primarily because it’s tied to a practical end result. This result has been imagined from the beginning, so Focused Thought is about investing the energy necessary to have the present moment catch up with that future goal. The most pressing example today would be all the people working tirelessly to create a coronavirus vaccine. They embarked on this journey knowing exactly what they wanted, and they will rigorously follow whatever road looks promising to get them to that goal.</p><p><span><strong>Fluid Thought</strong></span>, on the other hand, has no end state in mind. It’s thinking for the sake of thinking. There is no practical value to extract, no expectation to fulfill. It’s like being in a rowboat in a vast ocean without any particular place to go. All you must do is row aimlessly, and take in all the observations you make along your little journey.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fluid Thought is about emptying any desire to be productive or useful, and instead becoming a blank canvas for whatever your curiosity comes into contact with. An idea is no longer interesting because of what you can do with it; it’s interesting simply because it’s interesting. You don’t need to <a href="https://moretothat.com/knowledge-is-not-a-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">store it as knowledge</a> to regurgitate later, as coming into contact with it is all that matters.</p><p>This is a remarkably difficult thing to do, especially because we’ve been conditioned to learn with an end goal in mind. From grade school to college, we learn things because we have an exam to pass. When we enter the workplace, we learn because we want to “add value” to our team (and get paid in the process). When we do creative work, we learn because we want to build things that are useful for our audience.</p><p>The problem, however, is that all this conditioning goes against the actual nature of our minds. If you take 10 minutes to sit down and do nothing, you’ll see how random and sporadic your thoughts actually are. The mind is exploratory by nature, but we’ve trained it to think linearly because we have been incentivized to prioritize Focused Thought. After all, the more we tie our worth to <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-omnipresence-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the societal value we produce</a>, the more goal-oriented we become.</p><p>Fluid Thought is a return to how our minds actually work.

This is even more relevant since I also publish my work, which means that I can’t just blurt out random thoughts on a page, and expect the result to be cohesive enough to be digested by another mind. I have to take time to formulate my thoughts, let them marinate, and structure them so that they’re clear enough to whoever might come across my work.</p><p>However, writing with an end goal in mind makes my thinking rigid, and cuts off the tangential threads that are unwoven naturally when thought is more exploratory. Too much linear thinking can make writing feel like a task, where the completion of one piece just means that it’s time to go looking for another topic to discuss. Repeat this process long enough, and you can see why so many people become disillusioned with it fairly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fortunately, there is an antidote to this, and it applies to any form of expression:</p><p><span><strong>Introduce time for Fluid Thought on a regular basis.</strong></span></p><p>By giving yourself the space to explore without expectation, you give your mind the freedom to play with whatever idea it comes into contact with. There is nothing that idea has to become; there is nothing you need to store to use for later. All that matters is that you’re wandering about, spending time in a playground that will disappear shortly afterward.</p><p>The way I put this into practice is by journaling every single day. I think in the last two years, I may have missed just two sessions – that’s how important the practice is to me.</p><p>This is because journaling carries no expectations, and gives me the space to write without any judgment whatsoever. When I open up my journal each day, I have no clue what will be written down by the end of the entry. All I do is put my pen to paper, and have my hand act as a mere conduit to whatever my mind wants to explore. It can be nonsensical, it can be stupid, it can be forgotten.</p><p>And all of that is perfectly fine.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Fluid Thought is that it reintroduces the beginner’s mind, or what the Zen Buddhists call <em>shoshin</em>. When you have no expectations, you drop all the defense mechanisms you’ve developed in your <a href="https://moretothat.com/pursue-mastery-not-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuit of mastery</a>, and reset your curiosity back to its baseline levels. This allows you to experiment with all kinds of novel ideas, as you have nothing to lose by doing so.</p><p>The same thing applies in the realm of learning. So much of what we learn is done for the purposes of what we can teach. But with Fluid Thought, we can read a book simply to enjoy it, without expecting any knowledge or wisdom in return for our attention. This is why I’ve been reading more fiction these days, as I know that I’m not delving into the pages so I can find material to write about afterward. I’m there to get lost in the story, and to be part of an adventure that is devoid of any obvious personal utility.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The paradox of Fluid Thought is that it’s easily accessible, but is difficult to enter into. This is because we live in a world where we are rewarded to provide value, so Focused Thought will always feel more practical. An efficient hustle receives far more praise than an aimless meander, so having goals and visions will be the default setting our minds operate on.</p><p>But take this mindset out too far, and we will forever be slaves to the future. Focused Thought is inherently about looking ahead, whereas Fluid Thought is about being immersed in the moment. Paradoxically, you must balance both by dropping your present expectations to position yourself toward a brighter future.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a Daoist concept called <em>wu-wei</em>, which roughly translates to “effortless action.” It’s about moving alongside the fabric of reality with action, but doing it in a seamless manner so you don’t create friction. To maintain a sense of serenity while meeting the demands of your everyday life.</p><p>In the end, that might be the best way to frame the power of Fluid Thought.</p><p>_______________</p><div id="custom_html-5"><div><div>  <p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png"><img src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png" alt="" width="1500" height="790"></a></p><p>  If you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That newsletter.

							<p>Last year, we showed you a <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2019/12/smalltalk-with-the-graalvm.html">Smalltalk live programming system running on top of GraalVM</a>. This year, <a href="https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/swa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we</a> bring some of the live programming experience from <a href="https://squeak.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squeak/Smalltalk</a> to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraalVM</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Language Server Protocol (LSP)</a>.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before we show you some demos and take a look at some implementation details, we briefly give you a tour of “example-based live programming” (ELP).</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live programming</a> is a form of interactive, exploratory programming. The goal of it is to help developers better understand the dynamic behavior of the programs that they build. For this, live programming provides short feedback loops during programming. Instead of having to recompile and re-run an application, live programming systems allow developers to <a href="https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/06/incremental-development-environments.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evolve applications at run-time</a>. Thereby, they can immediately observe the effects of their modifications.</p>
<p>One style of live programming is&nbsp;built around the idea of examples. Systems that support this allow developers to&nbsp;<em>exemplify</em> their code with annotations. Such examples usually define a receiver, arguments, and optional code for setup and teardown. Here’s what that looks like in <a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Babylonian/JS</a>, an ELP system we’ve built in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lively_Kernel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lively Kernel</a>:</p>

<p>These examples are then used by the programming environment to re-run annotated functions on every code change. Developers can add so-called <em>probes</em>&nbsp;to individual expressions to see intermediate results of all evaluations of an expression during the execution of the example. In the following screenshot, there are two probes – one defined on the&nbsp;<em>y</em>&nbsp;variable and the other one on <em>this.ctx</em>:</p>

<p>A variety of different kinds of probes exists in example-based live programming systems. <em>Assertion probes</em>, for example,&nbsp;check the expression result against an assertion. <em>Expression probes</em>&nbsp;allow the evaluation of additional code inline. If you’d like to learn more about ELP systems, have a look at our research paper on <a href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Babylonian-style Programming</em></a>.</p>
<p>While this makes for a rich, interactive programming experience, building ELP systems requires a lot of effort. Creating such systems can entail modifications throughout the whole stack of a programming ecosystem including the code editor, the reflection protocol, the parser and compiler, and the virtual machine. As a consequence, implementations are usually tightly integrated with a particular programming environment and virtual machine. So far, it was therefore necessary to start from scratch to build systems like this for other languages or editors.<br>
As it turned out, GraalVM and the Language Server Protocol can dramatically reduce such efforts. More on that later, time to show you some demos of our latest ELP system!</p>
<h2>Demos</h2>
<p>A video is worth a thousand words, and it makes sense to see our new ELP system in action before we look at its implementation. Let’s start with a simple demo showing how our system can be used to interactively implement a Fibonacci function:</p>
<p><span><iframe width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZCGGIV-aRk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>As you’ve seen, our ELP system provides immediate feedback as well as a consistent programming experience across the languages supported by GraalVM. Furthermore, it integrates other tools, such as a simple object inspector or a debugger. But what we think is even more interesting than this, is that the system can also be used for <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/polyglot-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building polyglot applications</a> – that is, building software in multiple languages at the same time:</p>

<h2>GraalVM and Language-agnostic Tools</h2>
<p>As you may already know, GraalVM is <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-ten-things-12d9111f307d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">far more</a> than just a JVM on steroids. Its ecosystem provides <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powerful tools for debugging and monitoring</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/truffle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Truffle framework</a> for building fast language interpreters, and a lot more. A key feature of most GraalVM tools is that they work across multiple programming languages. GraalVM supports the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/dap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug Adapter Protocol</a>, for example, which is what we’ve used to debug across languages in the second demo. This is only possible because the tool implementation does not rely on any language specifics. Instead, the implementation is entirely based on Truffle’s <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/graalvm-as-a-platform/implement-instrument/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instrument API</a>, just like all other GraalVM polyglot tools.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3359619.3359746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we worked with the GraalVM team</a> on a language-agnostic <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/lsp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation of a language server</a> for the LSP. With this language server, GraalVM can provide developers with common programming features (e.g., auto-completion or go to definition) for all its languages and within different programming environments. Here’s how this works:<a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img data-attachment-id="2789" data-permalink="https://www.javaadvent.com/2020/12/live-programming-with-the-graalvm-the-lsp-and-vs-code.html/graalvm-lsp" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=1600%2C776&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1600,776" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="GraalVM and the LSP" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?fit=600%2C291&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=600%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="600" height="291" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1024%2C497&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=768%2C372&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1536%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=1240%2C601&amp;ssl=1 1240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?resize=508%2C246&amp;ssl=1 508w, https://i2.wp.com/www.javaadvent.com/content/uploads/2020/12/graalvm-lsp.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>As the developer modifies the program through the programming environment, the GraalVM language server analyzes the code of the program. When auto-completion is triggered by the developer, for example, the server can provide appropriate suggestions to the programming environment on request. Both communicate through the LSP.</p>
<p>All you need to try this out, apart from a GraalVM installation of course, is a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code editor or IDE with LSP support</a>. For Visual Studio Code, GraalVM ships an <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/tools/vscode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension</a> that helps you to set everything up.</p>
<h2>Building a Live Feedback Loop on Top of the LSP and GraalVM</h2>
<p>Together with some of our graduate students, we wanted to find out whether we can build a live programming system independent of both the language and the programming environment. If it is possible to build a language-agnostic debugger, we could probably use GraalVM and Truffle for building the live system independent of the language. And we could use the LSP to decouple the tool’s backend from the programming environment. However, a key requirement for a live system is a fast feedback loop. That usually means it should provide feedback in under a second, which is considered the threshold after which a user starts wondering if an interactive system is still responding<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124079144000117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The LSP already communicates common file operations (e.g., open, modify, and close events) to a language server. It also supports <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#command" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commands</a> that can be executed by a code editor. <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#notificationMessage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notification messages</a> can trigger events in the editor. Therefore, all we had to do is implement a command for the analysis of exemplified code in the language server. To inform the user about the progress of the analysis, the server can send appropriate notification messages. Conceptually, this works as follows:</p>

<p>Every time the developer modifies the program, the GraalVM language server runs our analysis. It reports results&nbsp;through the LSP to the programming environment, which visualizes them. Now, we only need to make sure this loop runs fast enough.</p>
<h2>Implementing new LSP Commands</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some code and implement a command for the GraalVM language server. New LSP commands can be added to the server with a class that extends <em><a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation/src/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/TruffleInstrument.java#L121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TruffleInstrument</a></em> and implements the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/tools/src/org.graalvm.tools.api.lsp/src/org/graalvm/tools/api/lsp/LSPExtension.java#L35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LSPExtension</em></a>&nbsp;interface. Such a class can then provide multiple <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/409535d77c291da23e19cb81788e57c78585721a/tools/src/org.graalvm.tools.api.lsp/src/org/graalvm/tools/api/lsp/LSPCommand.java#L34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LSPCommands</em></a>. Here’s a simple&nbsp;example:</p>
<pre>class RudolphCommand implements LSPCommand {
  String getName() {
    return "rudolph";
  }

  Object execute(LSPServerAccessor server, Env env, List&lt;Object&gt; arguments) {
   return "Happy Holidays!";
  }
}</pre>
<p>When we now run the GraalVM language server with our code put on the classpath, the server will automatically pick up our new command. In VS Code, we can then trigger the command as follows:</p>
<div>
<pre>vscode.commands.executeCommand('rudolph').then((result) =&gt; {
  vscode.window.showInformationMessage(result as string);
});</pre>
</div>
<p>As a result of this example, the user will see “Happy Holidays!” as an information message displayed in VS Code when the above is executed by an extension.</p>
<p>An ELP system needs to do a bit more work than that of course. To keep it simple, here’s some pseudo code that shows how the analysis works conceptionally:</p>
<pre>Object execute(LSPServerAccessor s, Env e, List&lt;Object&gt; a) {
  <span><span data-hydro-click="{&quot;event_type&quot;:&quot;code_navigation.click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;repository_id&quot;:302272162,&quot;ref&quot;:&quot;main&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Java&quot;,&quot;originating_url&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/hpi-swa/polyglot-live-programming/blob/main/src/de.hpi.swa.liveprogramming/src/de/hpi/swa/liveprogramming/BabylonianAnalysisExtension.java?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:2368856}}" data-hydro-click-hmac="1d766e023e7195b2c03a7611c2fbc73b16b9e876a07b77bac1634c0ffc1bbcc1">AnalysisResult</span></span> result <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span><span data-hydro-click="{&quot;event_type&quot;:&quot;code_navigation.click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;click_on_symbol&quot;,&quot;repository_id&quot;:302272162,&quot;ref&quot;:&quot;main&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;Java&quot;,&quot;originating_url&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/hpi-swa/polyglot-live-programming/blob/main/src/de.hpi.swa.liveprogramming/src/de/hpi/swa/liveprogramming/BabylonianAnalysisExtension.java?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container&quot;,&quot;user_id&quot;:2368856}}" data-hydro-click-hmac="1d766e023e7195b2c03a7611c2fbc73b16b9e876a07b77bac1634c0ffc1bbcc1">AnalysisResult</span></span>();
  findExamplesAndEvaluateFilesOpenedInEditor(s, e, result);
  ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; f = sendUpdatesPeriodically(s, result);
  try {
    for (Example example : result.getExamples()) {
      runExampleInstrumented(e, result, example);
    }
  } finally {
    f.cancel(true);
  }
  return result;
}</pre>
<p>First, all files opened in the editor are scanned for examples and probes, which are managed in a result object. The files are then evaluated using the instrument’s <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/TruffleInstrument.Env.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Env</em></a> object. After that, all examples are executed and instrumented using <em><a href="https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/instrumentation/ExecutionEventNode.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExecutionEventNodes</a></em>&nbsp;from the Instrument API. While the examples are running, we periodically send the result object with intermediate results via notifications over to the programming environment. This way, the system can provide feedback in under a second, even when examples take more time to run.&nbsp;And finally, we return the result object signaling that the analysis is complete.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at instruction fetch, decode and dispatch in the Cortex-A72 micro-architecture. These are the “front-end” stages of the core pipeline. The “back-end” of the pipeline consists of the register file(s), execution units and retirement (reorder) buffer. Branch prediction is frequently associated with the front-end since it directly affects instruction fetch.</p>



<p>The front-end has one major job: Fetch ARMv8 instructions and keep the back-end execution units as busy as possible.</p>



<p>This page is required reading for <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/raspberry-pi-4-mini-review/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> (BCM2711, ARM Cortex-A72) programmers who want to tune their programs for the <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/raspberry-pi-4-arm-cortex-a72-processor/">ARM Cortex-A72</a>. It is also necessary background information for programmers doing performance measurement with <a href="http://sandsoftwaresound.net/performance-events-on-raspberry-pi-4-tips/">PERF (Performance Events for Linux) on Raspberry Pi 4</a>.</p>



<h2>Fetch, decode and dispatch </h2>



<p>The Cortex-A72 pipeline has 15 stages. [On-line sources disagree on the length; some sources claim 14 stages.] The front-end stages are:</p>



<ul><li>Fetch (5 stages) </li><li>Decode (3 stages) </li><li>Rename (1 stage) </li><li>Dispatch (2 stages) </li></ul>



<p>The back-end pipeline stages are:</p>



<ul><li>Execute (1 to 6 stages depending upon unit) </li><li>Write-back/retirement (2 stages) </li></ul>



<p>Each execution unit has its own pipe:</p>



<ul><li>Integer 0 (1 stage/cycle) </li><li>Integer 1 (1 stage/cycle) </li><li>Integer multi-cycle (4 to 12 cycles) </li><li>FP/ASIMD 0 (6 to 18 cycles) </li><li>FP/ASIMD 1 (6 to 32 cycles) </li><li>Load L1D cache hit: 4 cycles) </li><li>Store (1 cycle) </li><li>Branch (1 cycle) </li></ul>



<p>See the ARM Cortex-A72 software optimization guide for exact instruction execution latencies.</p>

<p>70 plus years after von Neumann, we still adhere to a linear, sequential program model. In the programmer’s view, there is a program counter (PC) which steps through instructions sequentially, even if some of the intended high-level computations could be performed in parallel by the execution units. Further, we force compilers to lay down instructions in the same linear, sequential fashion.</p>



<p>The front-end’s job is to find instruction-level parallelism (ILP) within the incoming instruction stream. The Cortex-A72 front-end translates ARMv8 instructions into micro-ops. It sends the micro-ops to the back-end functional units for execution and architecture-level retirement. </p>



<blockquote><p>
This all may seem inefficient and crazy and it is. Program representation and execution need a major re-think along the lines of the once-investigated dataflow architecture. Why do and then un-do?
</p></blockquote>



<p>Front-end translation is really two steps: translating ARMv8 instruction into macro-ops and then translating macro-ops into micro-ops. Let’s examine the details.</p>



<p>First, fetch acquires a 16-byte (128 bit quadword) fetch window and it recognizes ARMv8 instructions within the window (and across windows). Then, the decode stages turn the ARMv8 instructions into one or more macro-ops. The decoder will fuse multiple ARMv8 instructions into a single macro-op if such an optimization is possible. Architectural registers are renamed to an internal register file which temporarily holds intermediate results. Next, the macro-ops are translated into micro-ops and the micro-ops are dispatched to the issue queue belonging to the appropriate functional unit. Micro-ops are dispatched into 8 independent issue queues (one queue per execution pipeline). When an instruction successfully completes, it is retired and its result is committed to the architectural machine state. [I will discuss the meaning of “successfully completes” in a minute.]  </p>



<p>There are limits on the number of ARMv8 instructions, macro-ops and micro-ops which are processed during a machine cycle:</p>



<pre>    3 ARMv8 instructions --&gt; 3 macro-ops --&gt; 5 micro-ops <br>           Decode              Rename          Dispatch </pre>



<p>During each cycle, the Cortex-A72 can decode 3 ARMv8 instructions, produce up to 3 macro-ops and dispatch up to 5 micro-ops. There are additional limitations on the number of micro-ops of each type that can be simultaneously dispatched (quoting the Cortex-A72 software optimization guide):</p>



<ul><li>One micro-op using the Branch pipeline </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Integer pipelines </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Multi-cycle pipeline </li><li>One micro-op using the F0 pipeline </li><li>One micro-op using the F1 pipeline </li><li>Up to two micro-ops using the Load or Store pipeline </li></ul>



<p>If there are more micro-ops to be dispatched above these limitations, they are dispatched in oldest-to-youngest age order.</p>



<p>According to ARM, most ARMv8 instructions are converted to a single micro-op (average: 1.08 micro-ops per instruction).</p>



<p>Register renaming allows micro-ops to execute out-of-order. Remember, we forced the compiler to lay down ARMv8 instructions in-order. Register renaming allows the micro-ops to execute out-of-order without violating data dependencies between architectural registers. There are 128 physical rename registers.</p>



<h2>Speculative execution</h2>



<p>Now the really tricky stuff — speculative execution. A basic block is a sequence of “straight-line” code with a single branch instruction at the end of the block. Program control flows into a basic block and is redirected at the end to either the same basic block or perhaps a different basic block. </p>



<p>Generally, basic blocks are about 9 instructions long. The branch at the end may be a conditional branch. The combination of short block length and conditional branching limits the number of ARMv8 instructions which can be aggressively fetched, decoded and dispatched within a single basic block. Without speculative execution, the processor must wait every time a conditional branch needs to be decided.</p>



<p>Enter branch prediction. When Cortex-A72 hits a conditional branch, it predicts the direction: taken or not taken. [More about branch prediction in a minute.] The front-end continues to fetch, decode and dispatch along the predicted control flow path. If the prediction is correct, hurray! The predictor has guessed correctly and the execution units have already been computing useful results. As each ARMv8 instruction completes along a known-to-be correct path, the instructions along the path retire in architectural order. This is the meaning of “successfully completes” above.</p>



<p>If a conditional branch is not predicted correctly (a “mispredict”), the intermediate results along the wrong path are discarded and the fetch stage is told to start fetching from the correct target address. This is called a “re-steer” as in the phrase “re-steering the front-end.” Recovery from a branch mispredict requires a pipeline flush and, yes, it’s expensive — at least 15 cycles.</p>



<p>The Write-back/retirement stage keeps track of the “retire pointer,” that is, the architectural program counter. The retirement stage is some of the most difficult hardware logic to design and it <strong>must be correct</strong>. The retirement stage maintains a reorder buffer which keeps the books on instruction and micro-op status. The reorder buffer has 128 entries, allowing up to 128 ARMv8 instructions to be simultaneously in flight.</p>



<h2>Branch prediction</h2>



<p>High performance rides on branch prediction accuracy. If the predictor guesses correctly most of the time, then speculative execution is a win. If the predictor guesses incorrectly, the core must throw away useless results and the execution pipeline stalls.</p>



<p>A deep dive into branch prediction is beyond the scope of this note. So, here’s a sketch. The predictor maintains a Pattern History Table (PHT) which retains the taken or not-taken status of (recent) branches encountered by the core. The predictor also maintains a Branch Target Buffer (BTB) containing the target addresses of these branches. The predictor uses the pattern history to predict the direction of a branch when it encounters the branch again. The BTB supplies the associated target address.</p>



<p>Cortex-A72 allows split BTB entries, accomodating both near branches (small target address) and far branches (large target addresses). That’s why you will see the BTB capacity quoted as 2K to 4K entries. The A72 BTB can hold as a many as 2K large target address (far) and 4K small target addresses (near). The A72 also has a micro-BTB which acts as a cache memory for the main BTB. The micro-BTB has 64 entries.</p>



<p>The branch prediction window is 16 bytes, which has implications for basic block layout. According to the Cortex-A72 software optimization guide, branch targets should be quadword aligned (i.e., 16 byte boundaries) and not more than two taken branches should be included with the same quadword-aligned quadword of instruction memory.</p>



<p>The compiler should really take care of quadword alignment and packing for you. As a higher-level language programmer, you can improve branch prediction by biasing flow conditions toward a true program path or the respective false program path. If a given path (true if-clause or false if-clause) is more frequently executed, the branch predictor should do a better job predicting the underlying conditional branch generated by the compiler.</p>



<p>Cortex-A72 has predictors for subroutine return and indirect branch. The predictor maintains an 8 [?] entry Call/Return Stack which remembers the most recent return addresses. Measurement shows that 8 entries (or so) are enough for most high-level language workloads, covering the most recently called functions.</p>



<h2>Bi-mode prediction</h2>



<p>There are three sources of interference in a Pattern History Table (PHT):<br>     * Cold miss (compulsory alias)<br>     * PHT capacity miss (capacity alias)<br>     * Conflict miss (conflict alias)<br> Conflict misses can be reduced by partitioning the PHT or using a different<br> indexing scheme.</p>



<p>The ARM Cortex-A15 Bi-Mode predictor uses two pattern history tables and a choice predictor to reduce negative interference of branches in different <br> program modes. Instead of one big PHT, the pattern history is partitioned<br> into two halves, i.e., two smaller PHTs. A choice predictor table selects<br> one of the two PHTs. The chosen side delivers the final prediction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I'm often amazed by all the mysterious behavior of my Windows machine. I'm totally incompetent with this type of Operating System and I'll not go deep into his configuration. </p>
<p>So let's see how this W10 machine will react against my OpenBSD desktop. In both cases I'll let open the same applications.</p>
<p>Both machines must use my own DNS server to go to internet. So, I'll compare the logs of my DNS in both cases. </p>

<p>On my home network, an OpenBSD serve is serving as dhcp &amp; dns server and as firewall. This machine will become the default gateway to go to internet. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20201212/setup.png"></p>
<p>I'll let the both machines runs the same among of time: 45 hours</p>
<p>On OpenBSD, I'm using OpenBSD-6.8 with Openbox and Tint2 for the graphical user unterface.</p>
<p>My windows Machine is running Wndows10-1904 with bitdefender as antivirus. For my daily job, I need to use Citrix client. You will see it in the results. </p>
<p>Applications running will be:<br>
- Chrome with 2 tabs: linkedin.com and gmail.com<br>
- thunderbird</p>
<p>The machine will just be rebooted before the test and will not be used, I just keep it running. </p>
<p>Both machines are lenovo T460</p>

<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20201212/results.png"></p>
<h2>global connections</h2>
<p>It's not a surprise that W10 is more using internet. 5375 connections against 1047 on OpenBSD. </p>
<h2>Antivirus</h2>
<p>We see that the W10 anti virus is using regularly Internet. Even if we remove this type of connections, W10 is using 2x more Internet than OpenBSD</p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>We see that W10 is much more interacting with google servers than OpenBSD. A more deep analysis would be interesting. Anyhow, I can show the top most url used by W10:</p>
<pre><code>play.google.com.    440
mail.google.com.    275
safebrowsing.googleapis.com.    93
clientservices.googleapis.com.  91
0.client-channel.google.com.    45
mail-ads.google.com.    45
</code></pre>
<p>On OpenBSD the top google connections are:</p>
<pre><code>mtalk.google.com.   188
play.google.com.    86
update.googleapis.com.  36
www.googleapis.com. 26
</code></pre>
<h2>home.lan</h2>
<p>Interestingly, W10 is looking for several machines on my home lan. Here after those names and their occurences:</p>
<pre><code>wpad.home.lan.  319
_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.home.lan.  2
lpgwmxrst.home.lan. 1
leyswydcvc.home.lan.    1
smlmiux.home.lan.   1
fzyotbnefb.home.lan.    1
eqnyycgfw.home.lan. 1
qumutqusdzayk.home.lan. 1
</code></pre>
<p>What is that ? </p>
<p>OpenBSD is not requesting such home.lan</p>
<h2>Intel</h2>
<p>Apparently W10 is connecting to Intel web sites. But it's not for what I though:</p>
<pre><code>gameplay.intel.com. 2
gameplayapi.intel.com.  2
</code></pre>
<h2>Linkedin.com</h2>
<p>Amazinly, OpenBSD is connecting more frequently than W10. Strange<br>
Could be linked to the activity on my account. More news, more refresh, or something like that. </p>
<p>On the W10, the requests were:</p>
<pre><code>www.linkedin.com.   195
realtime.www.linkedin.com.  38
</code></pre>
<p>On OpenBSD, there were:</p>
<pre><code>www.linkedin.com.   419
play.google.com.    96
realtime.www.linkedin.com.  78
media-exp1.licdn.com.   2
static-exp3.licdn.com.  2
</code></pre>
<h2>Thunderbird</h2>
<p>We see that on W10 thunderbord is checking more frequently the mail's server. Maybe due to a parameter<br>
In both cases, it reports some data to mozilla. </p>
<pre><code>blocklists.settings.services.mozilla.com.   4
firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com.  4
prod.balrog.prod.cloudops.mozgcp.net.   4
aus.thunderbird.net.    2
</code></pre>
<h2>Microsoft</h2>
<p>As expected, W10 is connecting a lot with microsoft servers. I don't know what are those sites. I list some of them here under:</p>
<pre><code>v10.events.data.microsoft.com.  140
settings-win.data.microsoft.com.    106
spclient.wg.spotify.com.    91
tile-service.weather.microsoft.com. 91
ctldl.windowsupdate.com.    68
notifications.4team.biz.    45
watson.telemetry.microsoft.com. 45
ws.4team.biz.   45
arc.msn.com.    37
ris.api.iris.microsoft.com. 32
login.live.com. 16
tsfe.trafficshaping.dsp.mp.microsoft.com.   15
v20.events.data.microsoft.com.  15
www.bing.com.   15
fe3cr.delivery.mp.microsoft.com.    13
slscr.update.microsoft.com. 10
</code></pre>

<p>Like expected W10 is connecting to several unsolicited servers. <br>
This is not a new info, but at least, in my specific case, I have a better idea on which servers. </p>
<p>With OpenBSD no bad surprises, it does what we expect. </p>

<p><strong>When you join two videos or images, it is pleasing to the eye to use a crossfade, or dissolve, or a wipe-effect at the point of transition. You don’t need any expensive software to do this – all you need is FFmpeg and an understanding of the <code>xfade</code> filter to add an eye-catching crossfade, dissolve, or any other transition effect to your videos. </strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, let’s take a look at some common transitions to make your videos look amazing! </p>



<h2>How do you add a CrossFade using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>The anatomy of a FFmpeg commandline using the <code>xfade</code> filter is as follows. Let’s look at it one line at a time. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg \
-i video1.mp4 \
-i video2.mp4 \
-filter_complex xfade=transition=&lt;FADE_TYPE&gt;:\
duration=&lt;TRANSITION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS&gt;:\
offset=&lt;OFFSET_RELATIVE_TO_FIRST_STREAM_IN_SECONDS&gt; \
outputVideo.mp4
</code></pre>



<ul><li>you need to provide two input videos – the first video appears before the transition and the second one appears after the transition</li><li>then we call upon the <code>xfade</code> filter with the following parameters – <ul><li>&lt;FADE_TYPE&gt; – here, you can choose from a wide range of transitions that the <code>xfade</code> filter supports (fade, dissolve, wipeleft, wiperight, etc.)</li><li>&lt;TRANSITION_DURATION_IN_SECONDS&gt; – here, you specify how long you want the transition to last</li><li>&lt;OFFSET_RELATIVE_TO_FIRST_STREAM_IN_SECONDS&gt; – here, you can specify (in seconds)after how many seconds you want the transition to begin relative to the first video</li></ul></li><li>finally, you specify the output video. Note, that you can also provide encoding parameters here. In the absence of any encoding parameters, FFmpeg will default to <code>crf = 23</code> with <code>libx264</code>.</li></ul>



<p>In the following sections, let’s take a look at almost all the transitions that are available in FFmpeg’s <code>xfade</code> filter. I have taken two video clips – CrowdRun and Parkjoy and I’ll be concatenating them using a different transition each time. </p>



<p>To make things easier, I’ve created a video for each transition and attached it here. YouTube might experience some buffering issues and start-up delay – please wait a couple of seconds and it will improve.  </p>



<p>Okay, let’s get started.  </p>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>I get asked a lot about learning languages, so I have a few comments about it here.
Hopefully I can awaken you from some dogmatic slumbers about language.</p>

<h2>Vocabulary is the least important part of learning a language.</h2>

<p>
This is hard for people to understand because I think most monolingual people think that languages are just different word lists that people use.
As a result, 101 students will manually look up every word in the dictionary to translate.
This actually increases the mental load of learning a language because people have the idea that to speak it, they have to think of something in English, then translate the sentence word by word, then say that.
What a pain.
</p>

<p>
So what is a language if not words?
It really is a set of constraints as to how words can go together: what order they go in when modifying each other,
but also languages are morphology.
Verb endings and tenses and such are literally the most important part of a sentence.
If you don't have a productive and reflexive use of verbs, you are literally just going to be reciting nouns you know like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
This is actually why I recommend people learning Romance languages or German to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/michel-thomas.html">use Michel Thomas's audio</a>.
Thomas doesn't lecture at all about what he's doing, but he focused only on using verbs and building up basic expressions from the bottom up until it's understood reflexively by students.
To actually learn any language, this is more or less what you are going to have to mentally do anyway in the process.
</p>

<p>
<strong>I would say it's actually possible to fluently speak a language knowing only about 50 words.</strong>
If you understand the "grammar" of a language, you can basically get by anywhere anytime with a couple dozen words only.
What words you don't know can easily be figured out, but you <em>can't</em> wing it with grammar and you <em>can't</em> wing it with morphology.
</p>

<h3>Computer metaphor</h3>

<p>
Granted, the same is true of programming "languages" as well, weirdly enough.
No one would think "knowing a [computing] language" means just knowing all the function and variable names.
The important thing is knowing the syntax of how you put functions (loosely verbs) and variables (loosely nouns) together.
After all, variable names are always different and functions can be easily invented too or called from some obscure library.
Someone who knows a language is someone who can use its syntax to produce novel expressions.
If you take a Python script, replace its functions with C functions, it's still Python, just calling a bunch of undefined functions.
People can only get away with even sort of believing this in the domain of human languages if you just don't know enough and end up assuming that all languages just work the same.
</p>

<h2>Then what is a language?</h2>

<p>
So really when you learn a language, you can't look at it as new words, but new patterns of speech that interconnect in a logical way.
</p>

<p>
Speaking fluently in that language means being able to use and combine its basic constructions into complex thoughts put in words.
This is why I'm really against "translating in your head."
If you're doing that, you're not actually using the language.
You're teaching yourself a silly English-word-replacement game.
I know it's very hard for word-thinkers not to think in words, but if you can't stop doing that for a second, you're not going to be able to learn a new language.
</p>

<h2>You will not learn a language by consoooming media.</h2>

<p>There's this lazy idea that somehow if you passively sit around and watch people using a language this will somehow endow you with the ability to flexibly produce a language in the same way you see others using it.
People want to believe it because they want to be able to watch TV or play a cell phone game like Duolinguo or valueless Rosetta Stone-like software and somehow gain competence in a language.
</p>

<p>
It's not going to happen ever.
<strong>Learning to play a boring computer game using words from a different languages is not the same as learning to speak the language.</strong>
</p>

<p>
You might say of "just listening to speech" that "that's what children do," but that's not true at all.
Children try pretty hard to participate and understand conversation.
They sometimes have a desperate personal need to understand each passing sentence and hear the language they are trying to learn for hours a day for years.
You watching some forgettable movie in the background as you play with your phone don't.
</p>

<h2>Are you actually thinking?</h2>

<p>If you want to know if you are actually learning a language, ask yourself that.
People are weirdly afraid against actually thinking through things and making new expressions in other languages when that's exactly how you learn them.
</p>

<p>A lot of language nerds love to email me about their Anki cards or their harebrained schemes for mass-memorizing words as if they're an Asian studying for a chemistry test.
Given what I've said about "learning words," you can guess my opinion on that.
Once people abandon the lazy route, sometimes they take up the <i>via dolorosa</i>: the route of suffering and assume that training themselves like a Pavlovian dog will help them become fluent in a language.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the only question that matter is: "Are you actually thinking?"
Are you actually going through the mental process of creating new sentences in a new language?
</p>

<p>
When I was learning Latin obviously I had no Latin-speaking friends and could barely get my hands on anything Latin-related.
But after I learned the basics of the language I started thinking in it constantly.
First that starts in my always implicitly translating English song lyrics or ads in my head into Latin.
That's actually difficult if you're dealing with something modern and idiomatic.
Not as bad with church songs.
As time goes on, I would overtly remember things in Latin sentences instead of English.
If I mumbled something under my breath I would make sure it was Latin.
At all points in time, I was thinking about how the language was structured and what it meant to produce sentences in it.
</p>

<p>
The sad fact is that most people who "learn" languages in school treat them as advanced cross-word puzzle like games where they don't <em>actually think</em> in the language, but have hilarious mnemonic devices in their head for relating what they want to say in English with something in the language they're learning.
</p>

<h2>Translating is a bad habit.</h2>

<p>
If anything, you should become <em>worse</em> at translating the further you go on and the more independently you can stand on your own in another language.
</p>

<p>
Latin is a good example.
I can read and comprehend Latin very well, but if asked to translate what I'm reading, I find that more and more difficult the better I read Latin.
Now it's easy for me to report the meaning of a passage, but phrase-by-phrase translation is something you have to think through because Latin and English are structurally very different.
This isn't just word order, but even how a Latin speaker approaches expressions and the kinds of phrases they use can translate only very delicately into English.
</p>

<p>
The problem nearly doesn't exist between English and Spanish, which are basically the same language.
I'm sure someone who only knows Spanish will feel like English and Spanish have many differences, but in the context of other languages, like Latin or Chinese or Japanese, it's hard not to view English and Spanish as having basically the same kind of syntax 95% of the time.
That actually goes for most modern European languages.
</p>

<h2>You sound stupid if you don't sound stupid.</h2>

<p>
Every language has its own set of phonological rules that determine what particular sounds are said how and where.
Phonological rules give us "our accents."
When someone speaks English in an accent, they are really just speaking English using the phonological constraints of whatever language they're more familiar with.
If they speak English competently, there's at least some extent to which they are abandoning their native phonological rules.
</p>

<p>
When you first start learning a language, you might read something aloud and say "I sound stupid."
This is because your natural way of speaking is obviously to say everything with an accent consistent with English.
You can probably remember the apathetic jock in Spanish class or whatever who religiously pronounced every Spanish word he mindlessly read with an almost intentionally non-Spanish accent.
</p>

<p>
To actually speak another language is to adopt the phonological tendencies and even the prosodic and tonal traits of that language.
When you initially do that, you will probably sound very stupid to yourself since violating phonological rules you're familiar with always sounds wrong.
If you do overcome that illusion of felt stupidity, you <em>won't</em> sound stupid when it counts.
If you refuse to improve your accent <em>immediately and from the beginning</em> you will sound like an utter moron forever.
</p>

<p>
There's actually a trick too: when you imitate a foreign accent, you are actually implicitly adopting the phonological rules of their language that you have noticed in real life.
My suggestion is when you are starting out, <em>read the other language in what you'd guess would be a stereotypical accent of the person speaking the language</em>.
If your imitation is good, you're speaking their language without an accent.
</p>

<h2>"The Critical Period" is fake.</h2>

<p>
That reminds me.
</p>

<p>
There's an idea in academic and clinical linguistics as well as popular culture that children have a magical plasticy of the brain that makes them uniquely good at learning languages.
This is supposed to be the reason why children learn languages "fast" and adults don't.
<strong>I think this is a myth.</strong>
You don't have to send me all the "proof" about this (don't worry, the Universities of Georgia and Arizona would've failed me totally if I hadn't seen it for my linguistics degrees there).
I sort of assumed that this was true for years, but on further thought, I think it's just a conspiracy of irrelevant data and copes...
or at least, it's not nearly as …</p></div>

    <p>There have been a lot of books that have influenced my career: Fred Turner’s <em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture,</em> Gabriella Coleman’s <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy,</em> Karl Marx’s <em>Grundrisse,</em> John Law’s <em>Aircraft Stories,</em> and Patricia Hill Collin’s <em>Black Feminist Thought.</em> These works are a kind of well to return to, again and again, to quench intellectual thirsts: thinking historically about communication technologies, and thinking about heterogeneity in the cultures of communication technologies.</p>

<p>But perhaps the closest to my heart, one of the books that came along at just the right moment in my career – a bubbling spring of the well – is Scott Rosenberg’s <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/"><em>Dreaming In Code</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Dreaming in Code</em> tells the story of the development of <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/">Chandler</a>, an open source, cross-platform “personal information manager.” This software was the brainchild of Mitch Kapor (of Lotus 1-2-3 fame, and the founder of a short-lived non-profit called the <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications Foundation</a>. While the OSAF was well-funded (to the tune of millions), and while Chandler was eventually built, it was marked by blown deadlines and cost overruns. And the project is now moribund.</p>

<p>In other words, as Rosenberg wryly notes, Chandler is another in a long line of failed software projects. Unlike building bridges, he notes, software engineering is <em>hard.</em></p>

<p>So, this is not a <strong>Goal 1</strong> post, because the software at the center of <em>Dreaming In Code</em> is no longer available. Yes, <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/">the website is still live</a>. Yes, the project did get far enough along to be useable. Maybe it could still be used if the code could be put into a container (Snap, Flatpak) – then, it could run in a modern Linux installation. If so, perhaps it could contribute to the #fald (FOSS Academic Lifestyle Dream).</p>

<p>Then again, I’m not sure I would want such old software handling my email and calendars without the latest encryption. The last time I got Chandler to work was around Ubuntu 16.04 (though I may be wrong about the date), and I remember being underwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why the project failed. Perhaps Chandler failed because it didn’t adhere to the <strong>Unix Philosophy</strong> (a decidedly <strong>Goal 2</strong> topic) – it did not do just one thing and do it well, but <a href="https://www.chandlerproject.org/vision/">tried to do lots of things</a> and thus did them poorly. Indeed, Rosenberg cites Linus Torvalds, who argues that open source production is best done with small goals.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was too centralized and did not attract a big enough base of contributors. Kapor reportedly threw a lot of money at Chandler, and part of his reasoning was to have his developers largely on-site in San Francisco. The project did not attract, as far as I can tell, a large base of contributors around world. (Indeed, if it had, perhaps we’d be on version 5.0 at this point).</p>

<p>In the end, Chandler has faded out of consciousness, replaced by a whole host of other “PIMs”. The features it largely offers are replicated by email clients – not to mention the monstrosity that is Google.</p>

<p>But tracing the failure of one relatively obscure FOSS project is not the real payoff of the book for me. <em>Dreaming In Code</em> is important to me in a <strong>Goal 2</strong> way because it started me out on the path of what I came to recognize as <strong>software studies.</strong>  Although it’s not an academic book – Rosenberg is a journalist and founder of <em>Salon.com</em> – the book is deep and exceptionally well researched. Academics have cited it – including luminaries like Rob Kitchin, Judy Wacjman, and Tim Jordan. Rosenberg’s research is excellent. His endnotes are <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/endnotes/">still online</a> – it’s a wealth of what might be called “classic software studies” citations.</p>

<p>He draws on Donald Knuth, Fred Brooks, Eric Raymond, Martin Campbell-Kelly, Vannevar Bush, Doug Englebart, Ellen Ullman, and many, many more. By tracing these citations, I could get a good grasp on the history of software engineering. Perhaps the most influential citation Rosenberg draws on is the late 1960s NATO conferences on software engineering. Along with Sarah Bell, I myself drew on that conference to write about <a href="http://computationalculture.net/heterogeneous-software-engineering-garmisch-1968-microsoft-vista-and-a-methodology-for-software-studies/">the engineering of Microsoft Vista as a form of “heterogeneous engineering”</a>.</p>

<p>But there’s more than just a wealth of citations. Rosenberg embedded himself with the Chandler team, watching their struggles and connecting those struggles to the history of software engineering. The chapters often start with an episode in the development of Chandler – say, a debate over which programming language to use – which is followed by a deep dive into the history and politics of programming languages. At times, readers might find these too much of a diversion from the story of Chandler. Indeed, Rosenberg’s next book, <em>Say Everything,</em> tends to avoid these sojourns. But I really, really dig them. The discussion of the NATO conference, for example, was just a great bit of history that prompted me to go and learn more about it.</p>

<p>In addition to placing Chandler into a larger historical context, Rosenberg is also a compassionate, but critical, student of the history of Chandler. It’s a model of analysis of the people and technologies that go into software engineering, told in a beautiful narrative style that I would aspire to myself, and again, the citations are rich.</p>

<p>I find myself returning to <em>Dreaming in Code</em> again, and again, over the years. The first time I read it, in fact, I was so enthralled that I was nose-deep in it while my partner was giving birth to our son (at one point, she knocked the book out of my hands and said, “no more reading!”). I remember this in part because my Zotero note is dated the day before my son’s birth. As I set off on a new project – my <strong>Goal 2</strong> project – I have decided to return to <em>Dreaming In Code.</em> And I find myself at the well, again, and it is definitely not dry.</p>

        <p>I like using RSS, I have <a href="https://miniflux.app/">Miniflux</a> running in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail">FreeBSD Jail</a> all the time. Lately I noticed that it’s not very handy to open up Flickr every hour to see photos by my friends, so I decided to use their RSS feed.</p>
<p>First of all, I’m so happy that Flickr provides an RSS feed, it’s an amazing standard and I wish more websites and services implemented it, or at least, not remove it :-)</p>
<p>So I go to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/norayr_chilingarian/">Norayr’s Flickr page</a>, and since Firefox <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1477667">removed RSS</a> I do Ctrl-U to see the page source. I search for the term <code>RSS</code> and I find nothing, I search for <code>atom</code> and I find a link!</p>
<p>I copy the link and I add it to my Miniflux feeds. I hit refresh and I see the following.</p>
<p><img src="https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/img/Flickr_Uploads_from_everyone.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Okay, so looks like those are photos… from everyone… on Flickr… from the future.</p>
<p>I <strong>KNOW</strong> that my time is synced, because I always have NTP running. After some digging, I figured that those posts ARE from the future. Flickr calls them “scheduled” posts.</p>
<p>Doing a little more digging, and I realize that I did not copy the full link with <code>id=norayr's_id</code> and now I’m seeing everyone’s feeds.</p>
<p>That’s all folks! :)</p>

                    <p>In this post, we delve into the performance implications of memory by looking into humble int
                        arrays.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are quite a few numerical types in Java. Most of them comes in pairs: short/Short,
                        int/Integer, long/Long. In this post we'll look at the int/Integer pair.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>On ints and Integers</h2>
                    <p>So, what is the difference between an int and an Integer, apart from the latter being able to
                        brag about having a capital 'I'? You probably know that int is a primitive, and that Integer is
                        an Object. It thus follows that Integer references can be null, and that Integers can be used as
                        generics in e.g. collections such as List.
                    </p>
                    <p>Integers are much more convenient to use. So, why does Java even have ints? After all, Ruby gets
                        away with doing just that. The answer is <b>performance</b>. Java can, contrary to what angry
                        c++ programmers might tell you, be used to write fairly fast programmes.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Benchmarking</h2>
                    <p>To look into this a bit more, let's forget all about maths in this example conceived to make a
                        point. We have a pair of programs that creates an array of integers and sums it up.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>Initialize and sum using int[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code><span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
<span>int</span>[] ints = <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
  ints[i] = i;
}
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i : ints) {
  sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <div><p>Initialize and sum using Integer[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code><span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
Integer[] integers = <span>new</span> Integer[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    integers[i] = <span>new</span> Integer(i);
}
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (Integer i : integers) {
    sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>On my laptop, the int[] version averages <b>17.91 ms</b> per round. The Integer[] version
                        averages <b>364.47 ms</b> per round. Thus, the Integer[] version is about <b>20x</b> slower.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, why is that? Since the Integer[] allocates 1 000 001 objects per round, the Garbage
                        Collector has to work very very hard. In this case I used the G1 collector, which according to
                        the GC logs spent 170% of the wallclock time in pauses. Allocating and garbage collecting
                        objects is expensive. The int[] version allocated 1 object, the int[] array.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, what happens if we only sum the integers? In this example, the arrays are already created.
                        This <em>should</em> us benchmark something else than the Garbage Collector.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>Sum using int[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code>
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i : ints) {
  sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <div><p>Sum using Integer[]:</p>
    
  <pre><code>
<span>long</span> sum = <span>0</span>;
<span>for</span> (Integer i : integers) {
    sum += i;
}</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>The Integer[] version now averages <b>23.86 ms</b> per round. Great improvement! But the int[]
                        version now averages <b>5.19 ms</b> per round. About 4x faster.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Memory sizes</h2>
                    <p>So, why is the int[] version faster now? After all, adding two integers is a single CPU
                        instruction. The answer is memory usage. We can use
                        <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jol/">JOL</a> to see how much memory the
                        different versions use:
                    </p>
                    <div>
    
  <pre><code>

<span>int</span> count = <span>10_000_000</span>;
Integer[] integers = <span>new</span> Integer[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    integers[i] = <span>new</span> Integer(i);
}
<span>int</span>[] ints = <span>new</span> <span>int</span>[count];
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; count; i++) {
    ints[i] = i;
}
System.out.printf(
        <span>"Ints size: %d, Integer[] size: %d%n"</span>,
        GraphLayout.parseInstance(ints).totalSize(),
        GraphLayout.parseInstance(integers).totalSize()
);
</code></pre>

</div>
                    <p>The int[] uses 40 000 016 bytes, while the Integer[] uses 200 000 016. For both arrays, the
                        array object header uses 16 bytes. In the int[] case, we then use 4 bytes per value. For the
                        Integer[], we use 4 bytes per Integer reference/pointer in the array. This could be higher
                        depending on whether or not <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-compressed-oops">compressed OOPs</a> can be used. Finally, 16 bytes are used per Integer object.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Integer[] case thus needs to read ~5 times as much memory. This is important, since
                        <b>reading from memory is much,
                            <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers">much</a> slower</b> than executing an add
                        instruction. In fact, most of the time spent in our second benchmark is spent reading from
                        memory. The 5x memory reading increase is very close to the 4x speed decrease.
                    </p>
                    <p>CPU Caches tries to make reading memory faster. However, since both the int[] and Integer[]
                        examples allocated more memory than the 4 MB L3 cache of my laptop processor, caching likely had
                        limited effects in this example.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interestingly, most profilers can't tell the difference between the CPU executing instructions
                        and the the CPU reading from memory. Thus, even when tooling reports 100% CPU usage, your
                        bottleneck can be memory usage.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Is this real?</h2>
                    <p>Needless to say, these examples are contrived. But the costs are real. Object allocation and
                        memory access affects the performance of real-world software. When I work with performance, I
                        tend to focus on memory usage and allocations first.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the game industry
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design">data oriented design</a> is used
                        to improve performance. The main idea is to optimize data structures to better utilize CPU
                        caches and reduce the amount of memory read. I.e, addressing the issues we saw in our
                        benchmarks. There is nothing limiting the techniques of data oriented design to game
                        development, it can be used in any application.
                    </p>
                    <p>Data oriented design does not have to be an all-or-nothing thing. Reducing memory allocations
                        and optimizing your data layout to improve the cache hit rate can be done gradually, and should
                        be applied in the parts of the application where it is needed the most.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>How to reduce memory usage</h2>
                    <p>The first step to reduce memory usage is to profile allocations - if you don't know which part
                        of your programme is allocating memory you do not know what parts to improve. Pre-maturely
                        optimizing the wrong thing is.. bad. <a href="https://blunders.io/">Blunders</a> is a profiler, but there are
                        many others. Use one that can tell you about memory allocations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you know which parts is slow, try changing the algorithm to use less memory. Sometimes
                        that's as simple as removing a log statement, sometimes it requires rewriting significant
                        parts of the software.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you have a lot of collections with primitives, look into using
                        <a href="http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/">fastutil</a> or similar to reduce memory usage.
                    </p></div>
                <div><h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>In this post, we have used a toy example to show just how much effect object allocation and
                        memory size can have on performance.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Once we have tokenized some program text, we need to check whether the tokens are in the correct sequence. For example, which of the following token
sequences are valid?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tokenization of “32 + 4”: “&lt;number, 32&gt;, &lt;+, +&gt;, &lt;number, 4&gt;”.</li>
  <li>Tokenization of “+ 32 4”: “&lt;+, +&gt;, &lt;number, 32&gt;, &lt;number, 4&gt;”.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regular expressions are not powerful enough to make the choices like these.  The rules about which token sequences are valid constitute the
<em>syntax</em> of a programming language. In this article, we will develop the concepts and techniques of checking syntactic correctness of a program
text.</p>

<p>We will assume that the program text is already tokenized. Thus, our input is going to be a sequence of tokens. The tokens we will be
dealing with in this article are as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The token “number” represents positive integers.</li>
  <li>The token “id” represents identifiers.</li>
  <li>The symbols “+”, “-“, “*”, “/”, “=”, “==”, “)”, and “(“ represent themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some examples of raw inputs along with their tokenized represenations.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Raw input</th>
      <th scope="col">Tokenized representation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"123 + 13132"</td>
      <td>number + number</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"123 * 234 + 12"</td>
      <td>"number * number + number"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"(978 * 13) / (123 - 12)"</td>
      <td>"(number * number) / (number - number)"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For brevity, we will call a sequence of tokens a <em>string</em>.</p>

<h2 id="context-free-grammars">Context-free grammars</h2>
<p>We need a way to represent programming language syntax. Let’s start with a simple example. Suppose we want to represent those
arithmetic expressions where two positive integers are separated by a “+” sign. We can represent this idea using the following notation.</p><p>

\[expr \rightarrow \underline{number} \underline{+} \underline{number}\]

</p><p>This is an example of a <em>production</em>. There are two parts separated by an arrow. The symbol “expr” on the left of the arrow is the <em>head</em>
of this production. The symbols “number”, “+”, and “number” on the right are collectively the <em>body</em> of this production. The underlined symbols
appear in the input and are called the <em>terminals</em>. Symbols that are not terminals are called the <em>non terminals</em>.</p>

<p>Only “number + number” conforms to the above production. To represent “number + number + number”, we need to write a new production.</p><p>

\[expr \rightarrow \underline{number} + \underline{number} + \underline{number}\]

</p><p>What if we want to represent an unbounded number of “number” tokens separated by “+” signs? The phrase “an unbounded number” suggests induction.
We need atleast two productions to represent an inductive definition.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
  expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>In the above set of productions, the second production is the basis case and the first production is the inductive case. Before we can use this
set of productions to represent something like “number + number + number”, we need to define a new concept.</p>

<p>In a set of productions, if we designate a non terminal as a <em>start symbol</em>, we have a context-free grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Definition 1: Context-Free Grammar</p>
  <p>A context free grammar is a 4-tuple \(\{V, \Sigma, P, S\}\) where:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>\(V\) is a set of non terminals.</li>
    <li>\(\Sigma\) is a set of terminals.</li>
    <li>\(P\) is a set of productions.</li>
    <li>\(S\) is a non terminal designated as a start symbol.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>We can thus use our above pair of productions to create a context-free grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>In the above grammar:</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(V = \{expr\}\),</li>
  <li>\(\Sigma = \{number, +\}\),</li>
  <li>\(P\) is the set of productions, and</li>
  <li>\(S = expr\).</li>
</ol>

<p>A string is a member of a grammar if it can be <em>derived</em> using that grammar. Let us derive “number + number + number” using our addition grammar. We start
with the start symbol.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>
    We <i>apply a production</i> by replacing a non terminal with its body. So the application of
    \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\) is this.
  </p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>On that \(expr\) in the string, we apply the same production \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\).</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  expr + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Finally, we apply \(expr \rightarrow \underline{number}\) on the \(expr\) in the last string. The result is the string we wanted to derive.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  number + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><div>
  <p>Definition 2: Derivation</p>
  <p>The sequence of steps taken by a grammar to produce a string starting from the start symbol of the grammar is called a derivation.</p>
</div>

<p>The above derivation of “number + number + number” is this.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  &amp; expr \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; number + number + number
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Context-free grammars describe languages. The langauges defined by context-free grammars are called <em>context-free languages</em>.</p>

<p>
    One unknown in the above derivation is the choice of production to apply at each step. How did we know that we should apply
    \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number}\) on all but the last step and \(expr \rightarrow \underline{number}\) on the last step?
    This problem is central to syntax checking and we will address it over the course of the remaining article.
  </p>

<p>With context-free grammars, we have a notation to represent the syntactic elements of a programming language.</p>

<h2 id="reductions">Reductions</h2>
<p>In syntax checking, we are given a grammar and a string and we want to check whether the string is in the language of that grammar. We need to find the
derivation of that string using the grammar.</p>

<p>A more convinient way to look into this problem is to look at derivations in reverse. The above derivation of “number + number + number” in reverse
looks like this.</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
  &amp; number + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr + number \\
  \implies &amp; expr
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>We are finding instances of production bodies in the string and replacing them with production heads. This process of replacing an instance of a
production body with a production head is called <em>reduction</em>. Reduction is the opposite of the application of a production. We can now
state the condition under which a string belongs to a context-free language.</p>

<div>
  <p>Definition 4: Criterion for a string to be derivable from a grammar</p>
  <p>
    A string can be derived from a grammar if we can reduce it to the start symbol of that grammar.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="extending-context-free-grammars">Extending context-free grammars</h2>
<p>The addition grammar is contrived. Because of that, we have not uncovered the full complexity of derivations and reductions.
Before moving further, we should learn about extending context-free grammars.</p>

<p>Context-free grammars are defined inductively. Thus, we can extend a context-free grammar by adding more inductive cases as productions.
Let’s try to extend our arithemtic grammar. Right now, it can only handle the “+” operator.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} \underline{number} \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>We now want to add support for the “*” operator. We can do that by adding more productions to our addition grammar.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition and multiplication grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} \underline{number} \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    We replaced the terminal \(number\) in our addition grammar by a new non terminal \(term\) and added basis and inductive productions for \(term\).
  </p>

<p>One way to add more induction cases is to introduce new non terminals. This is what led us from addition grammar to addition and multiplication grammar.
Let us look at another example. If we want to handle parenthesized expressions like “(123 + 12) * 3”, we can extend our addition and multiplication grammar
like this.</p>

<div>
  <p>Addition and multiplication with parenthesis</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow f\!actor \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number} \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{(} expr \underline{)}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    We replaced \(\underline{number}\) in addition and multiplication grammar by a new non terminal \(f\!actor\) and added two new productions
    for \(f\!actor\). The production \(f\!actor \rightarrow \underline{number}\) is the basis case and \(f\!actor \rightarrow (expr)\) is the
    inductive case.
  </p>

<p>We can add inductive cases to our grammar without introducing new non terminals by changing the way non terminals are arranged in production bodies.
Let us extend our grammar to handle “" and “-“ operators.</p>

<div>
  <p>Complete arithmetic grammar</p>
  <p>Start symbol: expr</p><p>
  $$
  \begin{align*}
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{+} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow expr \underline{-} term \\
    expr &amp; \rightarrow term \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \underline{*} f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow term \space \underline{/} \space f\!actor \\
    term &amp; \rightarrow f\!actor \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{number} \\
    f\!actor &amp; \rightarrow \underline{(} expr \underline{)}
  \end{align*}
  $$
</p></div>

<p>
    That is, we added two new productions, \(expr \rightarrow expr \underline{-} term\) and \(term \rightarrow term \space \underline{/} \space f\!actor\)
    without changing anything else.
  </p>

<p>The complete arithmetic grammar is realistic enough for us to elucidate points we would otherwise have missed had we continued with our
original addition grammar.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-reductions">Implementing reductions</h2>
<p>Let us go back to the problem of implementing reductions. The implementations of reductions, and of grammars, are called parsers. The process of
reducing a string of tokens to the start …</p></div></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>I'm pretty impressed by what I've seen with Apple's M1 Chip. It's really fast and powerful for essential everyday tasks, which include browsing the web, working with Intel-based apps, and using programming apps. Yes – the ecosystem is moving, and that may take time, but I think M1 is worth paying for it because of its phenomenal performance.</p><p>M1 is fast, and many benchmarks have proved its performance. However, I was curious about the performance of the programming languages using M1. So I decided to test it for the most popular workloads here.</p><p>Before you see the results, you should know that some benchmark suites are memory-intensive, some are CPU-intensive, and some have no benefits with multi-core processing because of its overhead or its difficulty for utilizing. It means that M1 can have an advantage over the desktop-class multi-core Ryzen processor even though the core count is lesser. <strong>Most importantly, I've focused more on real-world development performance testing rather than synthetic, production tests.</strong></p><p>You can check the raw benchmark data <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4U7LAImfEcXRihJbySZcRr32tn6WSWAtslfXltds58/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><p>I add the following comment as of Dec 14: we care how fast our dev computer runs. the multi-core advantage of 3900X is useless for most of the benchmarks here that don't represent the real-world production performance at all but devs usually work on their laptops, desktops, etc most of the time so I think such real-world development performance benchmarks make it worthwhile though. of course, Ryzen 3900X will perform way better than M1 and Intel when it comes to production, mostly achieved by parallelizing.</p><h2 id="test-environment">Test Environment</h2><ul><li>Apple M1: Mac Mini (16GB RAM), MacBook Air (8GB RAM) / macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (All executables used for benchmarks are natively compiled for Apple Silicon.)</li><li>Ryzen 3900X: ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T / 16GB DDR4-3200 x 2 / Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (tested after shutting down background tasks.) – You may wonder why I used 3900X instead of Ryzen 5000-series CPUs: Because I don't have it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy announced its intention to offer $400M of debt to investors, and a plan to purchase Bitcoin with the proceeds.</p><p>This was the 4th time MicroStrategy announced plans to buy Bitcoin, but for the first time, the market had a strong negative reaction to MicroStrategy's announcement.</p><p>On December 8th, Microstrategy's stock was down by 14%, their largest single-day decline since March 18th.</p><p>Why the negative reaction? Because this time the Bitcoin would be bought with other people's money, instead of the cash reserves already on MicroStrategy's balance sheet.</p><p>Despite the negative reaction, this bet makes a ton of sense.</p><p>MicroStrategy is a business generating tens of millions of dollars in annual cash flow from operations, they've got almost no long-term debt, and they have access to some of the cheapest capital in the world.</p><p>They also have an ongoing Bitcoin bet that has returned over 50% in a few months, and this offering gives them an opportunity to almost double the stakes.</p><p>Let's break down the potential upside and downside of MicroStrategy's latest debt offering.</p><h2>Microstrategy's Debt Offering</h2><p>First, let's look at the type of debt MicroStrategy offered investors.</p><p>They offered "unsecured senior convertible notes", a quick break-down of the term is below.</p><p><strong>Unsecured:</strong> Microstrategy is not giving investors ownership of any assets as collateral. For investors, this obviously comes with a higher risk than debt secured by some underlying asset like real estate or equipment.</p><p><strong>Convertible:</strong> Microstrategy can convert this debt into shares of Microstrategy or cash. The equity conversion rate for the notes will be 2.5126 shares of MicroStrategy per $1,000 of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $397.99 per share. Microstrategy currently trades for less, so this strategy only makes sense when the stock value rises above $398.</p><p><strong>Senior:</strong> If Microstrategy defaults on its debt, company assets are paid out to creditors in priority sequence.</p><p>Secured debt is paid off first, then unsecured debt, and then finally the equity shareholders get whatever is left (if anything). Within each priority level, there are sub-levels of priority. Senior secured debt is paid back before junior secured debt, senior notes are paid off before junior notes, and preferred stock is paid off before common stock.</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> A particular kind of corporate debt, typically with a maturity period of 10 years or less.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Debt Offering Timeline</h3><p>On December 7th, MicroStrategy's intention was to offer:</p><ul role="list"><li>$400M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $60M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 9th, MicroStrategy officially priced their offering at:</p><ul role="list"><li>$550M of unsecured convertible senior notes</li><li>Due in 2025, with a semi-annual interest payment at 0.75% APY</li><li>With an option for investors to buy an extra $100M of notes within 13 days of the offering</li></ul><p>On December 11th, MicroStrategy closed the round of fundraising, and sold the extra $100 million option too. As a result, their net proceeds were $634.9 million after fees.</p><p>And with that money, they plan to buy more Bitcoin - since they've already converted 100% of their cash and short-term investments into Bitcoin.</p><h3>MicroStrategy's Bet In A Nutshell</h3><p>Here's what this entire bet boils down to.</p><p>MicroStrategy must pay $4.9M in each of the next five years as interest on their debt offering. That adds up to $24.4M in interest payments, plus a lump sum payment of the $650M original debt offering in December 2025.</p><p>That's a grand total of $674.4M paid off over the course of 5 years.</p><p>But there's a bonus option for MicroStrategy. If their Bitcoin bet pays off and they want to de-leverage, or if their stock price rises above $400, they have the option to convert some or all of the debt into equity or cash.</p><p>From the $650M offering, MicroStrategy expects to keep $634.9M that they can invest in Bitcoin. The other $15.1 million goes towards various fees and commissions.</p><p>Therefore, to turn their $634.9M into $674.4M, they'll just need a 1.2% annual return on their Bitcoin investment. </p><p>In other words, assuming MicroStrategy acquires Bitcoin around $18,750 per coin, they'll have paid for all 5 years of interest payments once Bitcoin hits $19,916 per coin. Anything above that is all profit.</p><h2>MicroStrategy's Upside Potential</h2><h3>How Much Could MicroStrategy Make?</h3><p>MicroStrategy has made 3 prior Bitcoin purchases.</p><ul role="list"><li>They're up $152M (61%) on their $250M August investment</li><li>They're up $140M (80%) on their $175M September investment</li><li>They're roughly even on their $50M December investment (made last week).</li></ul><p>All together, their $475M of cash is now worth $765M (up 61%) in just a few months.</p><p>With this $634.9M of cash from investors, they can buy just under 35,000 more coins. Since they already have 40,824 BTC, they will likely hold over 75,000 BTC by the end of December.</p><h3>How Much Higher Might Bitcoin Go?</h3><p>Obviously this is unknowable, and no prediction will be perfect when we look back five years from now. Still, there are enough influential figures in finance who have put out Bitcoin price predictions that it would be unwise to ignore them completely.</p><p>In addition, these people have all been successful capital allocators outside of the Bitcoin world, so their stance on Bitcoin as an asset class is less biased than the price predictions one might find on Bitcoin Twitter. They don't need Bitcoin to succeed, but they still think it will.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwHI6OC3rc8">Raoul Pal</a>: $1M per coin in the next five years</p><p><a href="https://winklevosscapital.com/the-case-for-500k-bitcoin/">Winklevoss Twins</a>: $500k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/classicmacro/status/1327381449000034307">Citibank Analyst Tom Fitzpatrick</a>: A move as high as $318k per coin by December 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/12/social-capitals-palihapitiya-says-bitcoin-is-going-to-1-million-in-the-next-20-years.html">Chamath Palihapitiya [in 2017]</a>: Probably 100k per coin in the next 3-4 years, and I think it is in the next 20 years, $1M per coin</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1328492371353489408">Mike Novogratz</a>: Going to 65k per coin (timeline not provided)</p><p>I'm sure I've missed a handful of price predictions, but you get the point.</p><p>On the high end, if Bitcoin gets to $1M/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $75B by 2025.</p><p>On the low end, if Bitcoin gets to $65k/coin, Microstrategy's 75,000 BTC would be worth $4.9B by 2025.</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that Microstrategy has massive upside potential if Bitcoin's price gets anywhere close to the predictions above. But what if it doesn't?</p><h2>Microstrategy's Downside Risk</h2><h3><strong>What Happens To MicroStrategy If Bitcoin Goes Down?</strong></h3><p>It's possible that Bitcoin's price in December 2025 may be lower than it is today, but it's not very likely. In its 12 year history, Bitcoin has never traded down over a five year period, and it's not even close. 5 years ago, it was trading for $436. It is now trading for $18,750.</p><p>That's a 42x gain since December 12, 2015.</p><p>Still, the past isn't always a good predictor of the future, so let's explore MicroStrategy's options if Bitcoin does have a negative 5 year return.</p><p>Microstrategy has a profitable business generating tens of millions of dollars in operating cash flow each year. In fact, from 2016-2019 they've averaged $65M of cash flow from operations per year.</p><p>That's plenty of safety margin to take care of their $4.12 million annual interest payment, assuming zero business growth and zero inflation. If either one is positive, it will be even easier to meet their interest payment obligations.</p><h3>What Happens If Bitcoin And MicroStrategy Go Down?</h3><p>Ok, but what happens if Microstrategy's business doesn't generate any cash in the next five years, and the price of Bitcoin is lower in 2025?</p><p>Even more unlikely considering MicroStrategy's track record of success dates back to 1989, but let's entertain the possibility. What can MicroStrategy do about a rough spell for both Bitcoin and their business?</p><p>First, they could issue more debt.</p><p>MicroStrategy's largest long-term liability is its office space, and otherwise the company carries almost no long-term debt on their balance sheet.</p><p>At a time when central banks are relentlessly printing money, and bond yields are basically zero, raising another round of low-interest capital in the future won't be a challenge.</p><p>Second, a remote-first future means they may not even have to raise more money.</p><p>Prior to 2020, Michael Saylor strongly believed in-person work was important for MicroStrategy's success, but the global lockdown in the spring changed his mind.</p><p>If MicroStrategy does pursue a long-term remote work approach, that eliminates their largest long-term liability. As their $100M of lease obligations for office space gradually expires, the extra money can help fund their debt interest payments.

<p>I recently bought a stud finder from Amazon based on it having the “Amazon’s Choice” tag – a reliable shortcut, right? Then the product arrived.</p>



<p>What struck me as initially weird about this product was that the instructions were all in an extremely small font – I couldn’t read them without straining my eyes, and there was no website link.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="909" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1024x909.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1024x909.jpg 1024w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-300x266.jpg 300w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-768x682.jpg 768w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1536x1363.jpg 1536w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-2048x1818.jpg 2048w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1200x1065.jpg 1200w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinkbox-studfinder-instructions-1980x1757.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>So, I searched online for the model number, TH220, but instead found references to another product by “FOLAI” with some poorly made YouTube reviews. That product looked exactly the same, except for the color and labeling. </p>



<p>I went back to the Amazon product page for “The <em><strong>Original </strong></em>Pink Box” stud finder and scanned the reviews (emphasis on “Original” is mine; you’ll understand the irony shortly). It was apparent that the majority of the reviews were for other unrelated products like a tape measure. Then, I noticed something strange in the “Style” selector tool for the stud finder. It appears that a hack was applied to have multiple, unrelated products all linked to this one by using the “style” feature.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="542" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack.jpg 580w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/style-hack-300x280.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"><figcaption>These various products were all attributed to this stud finder by Amazon. Thus, the stud finder receives irrelevant reviews by using the “Style” feature. Most of the reviews are for tape measures and screwdrivers. </figcaption></figure>



<p>I’m not sure this is a case of “<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/customer-reviews-ratings/hijacked-reviews-on-amazon-can-trick-shoppers/">review hijacking</a>,” since the reviews were presumably for other products by the same company.</p>



<p>I contacted Amazon support to ask what was going on, but support was initially useless: they replied to my inquiry with a <em>description of the product</em>. After further discussion, they assured me about the quality of their inventory and offered that I could return it for a refund, and then gave me a $5 credit.</p>



<p>The instructions themselves – although too small to read comfortably – had reasonably clear English, suggesting a possible American manufacturer. So, I searched for some of the text strings from the manual and found it copied to more clones of this product:</p>



<ul><li>“Shibeier” stud finder on Sears’ website</li><li>“INTEY” stud finder</li><li>“FOLAI”</li><li>“Baqsoo” (also found on Amazon through a search of the manual that revealed some Q&amp;A was using product page keyword stuffing from the manual)</li><li>“TAVOOL”</li><li>“ZBYZF”</li><li>“VIGOELAN”</li><li>(<a href="https://www.sainsmart.com/products/sainsmart-toolpac-sma19-stud-finder-wall-scanner">SainSmart</a> <a href="http://wiki.sainsmart.com/index.php/101-92-512">ToolPac</a> SMA19) – finally – what <em>appears </em>to be the original source of the instruction manual: the same instructions, fewer typos (an artifact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>?), and a different model number cut &amp; pasted.</li></ul>



<p>So, which is the real manufacturer? And which are knockoffs? And when can you trust “Amazon’s Choice?” What does “choice” imply, anyway? It’d seem to imply some editorial review by Amazon, but since Amazon won’t say, it is reasonable to speculate that it is actually an algorithmic semi-sponsored result, in the sense that Amazon strikes some balance between expected profit margin and rating.</p>



<p>What’s a consumer to do? I checked ReviewMeta and Fakespot for reviews, but both had equally failed the test:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="582" height="1024" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-582x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-582x1024.png 582w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade-170x300.png 170w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/reviewmeta-grade.png 717w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"><figcaption>ReviewMeta trusted nearly all the irrelevant reviews.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Above is ReviewMeta. Below is Fakespot.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="703" height="571" src="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade.png" alt="" srcset="https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade.png 703w, https://brianbien.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/fakespot-grade-300x244.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px"><figcaption>Fakespot also trusted the bad reviews.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So what exactly is going on? My guess is that “manufacturers” are being invented at an increasing pace in order to flood the search results with listings of the same product, and Amazon is struggling to keep up with the pace.</p>



<p>It seems we’re seeing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/">rise in counterfeits</a> on Amazon. Increasingly, it’s smart to revert back to name brands, <a href="https://brianbien.com/amazons-fake-review-problem/">ignore online reviews</a>, and shop from retailers who do the vetting of products that they sell.</p>



<p>So, did the stud finder work? I’m not sure whether I can trust it to detect wires in the wall, since the results seem strange and filled with a lot of false positives. As a non-expert, I need a name brand for comparison to see if the readings I’m getting are reliable.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>The last time we talked about software architecture, I introduced you to<a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/11/22/layered-architecture-what-is-layered-architecture-and-when-to-use-it/"> Layered Architecture</a>. Today we will start with Clean architecture (also called Onion or Ports and adapters architecture) and more specifically domain-driven design.</p>



<p>Clean architecture as a concept is significantly more complex than layered architecture. So I decided to split the article into two parts. In today’s article, I will try to explain the idea behind Domain-driven design simply.</p>



<h2><strong>What is Domain-driven design?</strong></h2>



<p>We need to understand domain-driven design because it lies in the center of Clean architecture (figuratively and literally).</p>



<p>Domain-driven design has its technicalities (that we are going to inspect in detail), but in the first place, DDD is a way of thinking.</p>



<p>As we can see from the name, this design approach is driven by the business domain. Or, said another way, we focus entirely on the business logic of the domain.</p>



<p>Integration and infrastructure features we consider details that the domain model <strong>does not know nor depend on</strong>.</p>



<p>In turn, the business domain can have sub-domains, and these sub-domains are isolated from each other as much as possible.</p>



<p>Let’s provide a simple example. Suppose we have to create an application for a food delivery system using domain-driven design.</p>



<p>The domain here is the entire process of ordering, payment, communication with the restaurant, and delivery and tracking.</p>



<p>And the sub-domains, as we can see, are order management, delivery management, etc.</p>



<p>Using DDD toward the example above should create an encapsulated core consisting of clearly defined business entities with strict boundaries. Don’t get panic. We will explain everything.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design first steps</strong></h2>



<p>The hardest thing about domain-driven design is building the right logical model of the domain and its sub-domains and defining proper boundaries. That is something that the developers <strong>can’t and should not do alone</strong>.</p>



<p>Developers should work in <strong>very close</strong> collaboration with the business people. Only business people know how exactly they operate their business, and only they can clarify the domain and subdomains to the developers.</p>



<p>At this point, developers <strong>should not</strong> take into consideration any technicalities, any. Their mission is to model the domain and its sub-domains only through the business logic point of view. They don’t think about databases, persistence, representation, other integrations, etc. The models they create are pure objects limited to any external dependencies.</p>



<p>Developers and business people should create a common language for business objects in the system. This common language is called <strong>ubiquitous language</strong>. Behind that fancy word hides the simple goal for common understanding. Terms (this also applies to the code) should be named so anybody can understand them.</p>



<p>Before continue with the main domain-driven design elements, let’s clarify some terms.</p>



<h3><strong>Bounded context</strong></h3>



<p>Bounded context is a pattern whose main idea is to draw boundaries between different sub-domains. We do this because we want each sub-domain to be as independent as possible.</p>



<p>From the example above, we see that our food delivery system has different sub-domains. Two of these sub-domains are order management and delivery management. The models that represent the two sub-domains should be isolated. Order management models shouldn’t know anything about the delivery models and vice versa.</p>



<p>If we have a model that should be represented in the two sub-domains, we duplicate that model. For example â€“ both sub-domains need a customer as a model. When we copy the model, we extract only the required properties for the specific sub-domain.&nbsp; So it is normal to have a model with the same name but with different properties in different sub-domains (of-course, we track that model by uniform ID in both sub-domains).</p>



<h3><strong>Anemic vs. rich models</strong></h3>



<p>For domain models, there are two concepts. They are anemic and rich model implementation.</p>



<p>Anemic models are models with only properties without any logic. Often they are also badly encapsulated using just public setters and getters. For example, anemic models we use when we have a database-centric architecture (like layered architecture).</p>



<p>Rich models have business logic. They are very well encapsulated. Instead of public setters and getters, we use methods for all the specific operations. Rich model collections are read-only and can only be modified through the methods and the constructor. Rich models can not be created nor exist in an invalid state. The implementation should guarantee that after any operation, the model is in a valid state.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, as you might guess, we use rich models.</p>



<h2><strong>Domain-driven design elements</strong></h2>



<p>Using the domain-driven design, we will face several different elements that build the core of it. They are:</p>



<ul><li>Entity</li><li>Value object</li><li>Aggregate (and Aggregate root)</li><li>Domain event</li><li>Factory</li><li>Repository</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Entity</strong></h3>



<p>An entity in domain-driven design is a rich model element that has a unique identification. For example, we might have an Order entity. Â&nbsp;The Order entity has an identifier (like autoincrement bigint). Using that identification, we track the entity and build relations.</p>



<h3><strong>Value object</strong></h3>



<p>Value objects are model elements that do not have a specific identification. Their identification is based on the comparison (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/equality-comparisons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by value</a>) of all their attributes.</p>



<p>They also can contain business logic. Value objects mainly live as attributes of other entities.</p>



<p>A good example of a value object is the delivery address of the Order entity.</p>



<h3><strong>Aggregate</strong></h3>



<p>Aggregate is a very specific structure for the domain-driven design.</p>



<p>An aggregate is a group of objects that should be handled together. Every aggregate has an <strong>aggregate root</strong>. The aggregate root is the main object responsible for the control of the other objects.</p>



<p>Any command or request toward the elements in the aggregate should come through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>In our example, with the food delivery system, such an aggregate is the grouping of Order and OrderItem entities. In this case, the Order entity is the aggregate root. If we want to add a new OrderItem to the Order, we should do it through the aggregate root.</p>



<p>Entities that are “below” the root level should not allow state modification outside the aggregate.</p>



<p>Using aggregates, we strive to achieve an always valid business model.</p>



<h3><strong>Domain event</strong></h3>



<p>In domain-driven design, as we said, the models should be encapsulated and isolated as much as possible.</p>



<p>For example, the Order aggregate should not reference or be referenced by the Delivery aggregate.</p>



<p>They not only should not know about each other but also contract-based injection is forbidden.</p>



<p>The only right way of communication is through domain events (some of you may argue, but I firmly believe that).</p>



<p>Every aggregate can publish and subscribe to events.</p>



<p>If a new order is created, the Order aggregate publishes OrderCreatedEvent event. Every other aggregate that is interested in this event can handle it and process it.</p>



<p>Domain events are part of the domain model, but their artifacts are processed outside the domain layer. In the next article, we will see that in detail.</p>



<h3><strong>Factory</strong></h3>



<p>As most of you know, a factory is a design pattern for creating objects. In domain-driven design, the factory pattern isolates the creation of domain aggregates from the application layer.</p>



<p>In the best-case scenario, a factory should receive plain DTO (or just primitive types) and contains as little as possible logic.</p>



<p>Factory pattern should always create objects in a valid state.</p>



<h3><strong>Repository</strong></h3>



<p>The Repository is another well know pattern. The idea behind it is to encapsulate communication to the data storage and provide a layer of abstraction.</p>



<p>In domain-driven design, each aggregate root has a repository. But as we said, the domain model should not be familiar with any infrastructure mechanisms. That’s why we don’t put repository implementations in the domain model but the infrastructure layer.</p>



<p>In the domain model, we put only the contracts (interfaces) of the repositories. That also will be discussed in detail in the next article.</p>



<h2>Domain-driven design in short</h2>



<p>Let’s summarize.</p>



<p>Domain-driven design is a <strong>way of thinking</strong>.</p>



<p>Working very <strong>closely with the business people</strong>, we aim to model the different domains of the business.</p>



<p>We create models (entities, value objects, aggregates) using <strong>only simple classes and primitive types</strong>. We don’t care about persistence, UI, external integrations, external libraries, etc. These things don’t belong in our domain core.</p>



<p>Models <strong>have complex logic</strong>, but we <strong>strictly</strong> <strong>encapsulate</strong> that behavior. They are <strong>always in a valid state</strong>, even after their initial creation.</p>



<p>Often we group different models because they can not live in a valid state only by themselves. Those groups we call <strong>aggregates</strong>.</p>



<p>Models live in isolation, so they can not communicate directly. For that reason, we use <strong>domain events</strong>.</p>



<p>The domain core <strong>does not depend on anything</strong>. Other layers (like application and infrastructure) depend on it.</p>



<h2><strong>What is next?</strong></h2>



<p>As I said above, domain-driven design is a core concept of Clean <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/category/software-design-and-architecture/">architecture</a>, and that’s why it is essential to get comfortable with that way of thinking. It is entirely normal to be confused at first, but this should not discourage you.</p>



<p>As a next step, I suggest you read Eric Evans’s excellent book “Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software”. While reading it, try to apply the knowledge to systems you have already developed without DDD. Believe me, that exercise will help you a lot.</p>



<p>In the next article, we will see how the domain model fits in the Clean architecture structure and the point behind all this complexity.</p>

<p>Space Invaders is a fairly popular game, with many implementations. Here we will implement a simple version with space ships moving and descending and a cannon shooting them. The game could be extended with other features, but this is already a very long blog post… By the way, if you are in a hurry, you can go directly to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/da11a5e937960e69dc473be131be732d">the source code</a> for the game.</p>

<p>We cannot have a Space Invader game without invaders, so let’s design these first. Usually, the graphics resources for games are created using specialized programs, but for a simple game like Space Invaders, we can just write the models as strings and write a some Racket functions to convert them into pictures. This is the same technique used in the <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/03/a-game-of-tetris.html">A Game Of Tetris</a> blog post. For example, here is the definition for the first alien, which we’ll call Zabrak:</p>

<div>
 <table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>
     </td>
    <td>
     <div>
      <pre><span></span><span>(</span><span><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))">define</a></span> <span>zabrak-frame-a</span>
  <span>'</span><span>(</span><span>"   ZZZ   "</span>
    <span>" ZZZZZZZ "</span>
    <span>"ZZZZZZZZZ"</span>
    <span>"Z  ZZZ  Z"</span>
    <span>"ZZZZZZZZZ"</span>
    <span>"  Z   Z  "</span>
    <span>" Z ZZZ Z "</span>
    <span>"Z       Z"</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>We can convert the above list of strings into a picture is just a few lines of code: each “Z” character is converted into a square, while the space characters are left empty. <code>row-&gt;squares</code> will convert a single string into a picture and <code>block-&gt;pict</code> combines the resulting pictures into a single block and applies the color to the blocks:</p>

<p>The end result can be displayed directly into the DrRacket REPL, allowing us to quickly get an idea of how the image will look like and make any necessary tweaks. We can design the look of our game graphics before we even get to write any of the actual game code:</p>

<p>The aliens in the game will be animated, having their antennas and legs move. This can be achieved by defining separate frames for each animation step:</p>

<p>We can visualize all the frames by applying <code>block-&gt;pict</code> on each of them, although it is difficult to see that the common parts overlap correctly and only the intended parts move:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/zabrak-all-frames.png" alt=""></p></div>

<h3 id="animations-in-the-repl">Animations in the REPL</h3>

<p>While the DrRacket REPL can display pictures directly, it cannot display animations. However, we can extend the REPL to support this: The REPL recognizes special objects, called “snips” which are objects that can display anything in the REPL. Snips can be used for a lot of cool things, such as using them directly in games, such as <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/06/ishido.html">Ishido</a> and <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2018/10/chess-game-using-racket-s-pasteboard.html">Chess Game Interface</a>, but also at providing complex visualizations in the REPL, for example an <a href="https://alex-hhh.github.io/2019/09/map-snip.html">interactive map</a>. Here we’ll write a simple snip to animate some pictures.</p>

<p>The <code>animation-snip-class</code> is an object which is used to deserialize snips — we don’t use this feature directly, but the Racket GUI system requires one such object to be defined for every type of snip class. The code is mostly boilerplate, but one such object needs to be defined for every type of snip used by the application, and each such object needs to have a different class name set using <code>set-classname</code>:</p>



<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> class is the actual snip and derives from the <code>snip%</code> class from the Racket GUI libraries. When constructed, it receives a list of pictures, <code>picts</code>, which are the individual frames of the animation, as well as an <code>interval</code>, in milliseconds, which defines the time between changing pictures. It has the following member variables and methods:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <p>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> members of the snip define the width and height of  the entire snip, being the maximum of all the pictures — this allows using  different sized pictures for the animation.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p><code>index</code> represents the current picture being displayed — a snip cannot  simply draw when it wants to, instead the system will invoke its <code>draw</code>  method at unspecified intervals, so it must be ready to draw its current  state at any time.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>on-refresh</code> method is invoked periodically from a timer (see <code>timer%</code>  creation below), and will increment the frame and tell the snip  administrator that this snip needs to be redrawn — this is how a snip can  inform the system that it has changed.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>copy</code> method creates a copy of the snip, this is required for snips  which are used directly in the DrRacket REPL, in this case, the  implementation is simple: it creates and returns new animation snip with the  same pictures and refresh interval.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>get-extent</code> method is invoked by the system to determine the size of  the snip — it is used to know how much space to reserve for it, so it lines  up nicely with other things in the REPL.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>the <code>draw</code> method is invoked by the system to actually draw the snip. While  the snip can draw anywhere it wants, it should usually draw at the passed  <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> coordinates, and not extend past the width and height it has  supplied to <code>get-extent</code>. In the animation snip case, the draw method uses  <code>draw-pict</code> (provided by the <code>pict</code> library), to draw the current picture.</p></li></ul>



<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> can be used directly, but object creation can be verbose, so we can define a more convenient <code>animate</code> function which creates this snip:</p>

<div>
 <table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>
     </td>
    <td>
     <div>
      <pre><span></span><span>(</span><span><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))">define</a></span> <span>(</span><span>animate</span> <span>picts</span> <span>#:interval</span> <span>[</span><span>interval</span> <span>500</span><span>])</span>
  <span>(</span><span><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objcreation.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/class-internal..rkt)._new))">new</a></span> <span>animation-snip%</span> <span>[</span><span>picts</span> <span>picts</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>interval</span> <span>interval</span><span>]))</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>To visualize the actual animation, we can simply call <code>animate</code> with the list of the pictures provided by <code>block-&gt;pict</code>. Even though only three frames have been defined for this alien, the actual animation needs to go though the steps A, B, C, B before it cycles back to the first frame. This is something that is not easy to pick up if the animation frames are listed side-by-side, but it is immediately obvious once the animation is played.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/zabrak.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<p>The <code>animation-snip%</code> itself will not be used in the game, but it is a useful tool in designing the game animations themselves. With the <code>animation-snip%</code> done, the rest of the aliens can be designed:</p>

<div><p><img src="https://alex-hhh.github.io/img/a044/all-aliens.gif" alt=""></p></div>

<p>You can design your own aliens: pictures for alien models can be easily found with an Internet search, and if you are unsure how to name the aliens, Wikipedia has a page listing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_alien_species:_Z">alien species names</a>. Finally, if you want to just have a look a the ones I defined, they are available in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alex-hhh/da11a5e937960e69dc473be131be732d">game source</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-the-arena">Prepare the Arena</h2>

<p>The Space Invaders game involves several “actors”: the alien ships moving across the screen, the canon moving left and right in response to user input and shooting lasers and the lasers hitting space ships. These actors need to be able to draw the object in the game window, respond to keyboard input and interact witch each other (for example, when a laser shot hits a space ship). The actors will also need a common “clock”, which measures the passage of time — this will be used both to drive animations and move objects across the screen.</p>

<p>We will need to write some code to manage the shared access to these resources and provide a common interface for the actors. This code is relatively generic: it does not know anything about the game or the game rules itself and could be reused to implement other games. For more serious games, this would be called a “game engine” but our code is too simple to deserve that name, so we will not use it here, instead we will call it an “arena”.</p>

<h3 id="the-scene">The Scene</h3>

<p>All the game actors can be kept in a global list named <code>scene</code>, with the <code>add-actor</code> and <code>remove-actor</code> functions added as a convenience. Actors such as space ships will be added at the start of the game, but other actors, like laser shots will be added during the game. Finally, actors can also be removed during the game, for example a space ship which was hit by a laser shot.</p>



<h3 id="the-gui">The GUI</h3>

<p>The game itself will be displayed in a window, which, in Racket GUI is a <code>frame%</code>. Frame objects also receive keyboard events and by overriding the <code>on-subwindow-char</code> method we can intercept these and send them to all the actors in the scene. The frame will also be notified when the window is closed, via the <code>on-close</code> method and we use this opportunity to set the <code>game-outcome</code> to <code>'abandoned</code>. The game loop described below will monitor this variable to know when to exit the game.</p>



<p>A somewhat unusual technique is used to create <code>the-frame%</code> in the code above: we create a class derived from <code>frame%</code> using <code>class</code>, than immediately instantiate that derived class and assign the resulting object to <code>the-frame</code>. In other languages, this is a two step process, but in Racket, they can be combined:</p>

    <p>Recently Google Photos ended their unlimited storage. You shouldn’t have been shocked, because unlimited is more often than not an unsustainable Ponzi Scheme.</p>

<h2 id="good-at-business">Good at Business</h2>

<p>When a software company gives you unlimited storage for anything, the only way for them to maintain that business in the long run is for them to make (amortized or not) incremental and recurring money from each thing they store. This is true, because storage is a recurring and forever cost.</p>

<p>Most B2C companies don’t make recurring money off of the data they store for you. They make money inversely proportional to how recent you stored the thing. Sometimes they don’t make any money at all. So it’s no surprise that unlimited is a Ponzi scheme, because that’s the only way to make the ledger look right.</p>

<h2 id="the-unlimited-ponzi-scheme">The Unlimited Ponzi Scheme</h2>

<p>Businesses will often follow a Ponzi Scheme-esque model with storage for their product. As they go through growth, newer customers are instantly delivering new revenue while their cost is very little - they haven’t started accruing much data. These customers offset older customers, who are getting more expensive as data retention continues forever.</p>

<p>Then, one day, the growth stops. You’ve gained most of the market you’re going to gain.  All of the sudden margin starts to slip. Fewer new users exist to offset the old users People look into and realize the unlimited scheme is up. Then they implement a retention policy and customers freak out.</p>

<h2 id="handling-unlimited-as-a-business">Handling Unlimited as a Business</h2>

<p>Businesses often fail at unlimited in a few ways.</p>

<p>First, companies should offer a way to pay more to get more storage. I can’t be mad that you won’t run a ridiculous business for me. I will get mad if you sink me into your product and don’t give me the option to pay a fair value to continue service.</p>

<p>Second, companies should be mindful of data retention policies from day 1.  The unlimited Ponzhi scheme is in many products not something that companies even know is happening. Things look good  until they don’t.</p>

<p>If you keep data around without retention policies, you will face a long road of performance, stability, and customer issues as you scale. Especially as your growth numbers slow, you should be mindful of the upcoming business realities sooner rather than later if you have anything that is unlimited in your product.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>There’s no free lunch in this world unless you’re willing to run around to different dumpsters to get it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Supabase dashboard has become more feature-rich in the last month. We have a powerful SQL editor backed by <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monaco</a>. We built an Airtable-like view of your database, making editing a breeze.</p><blockquote><p>Features, performance, DX - choose three</p></blockquote><p>Performance can quickly regress when adding new features, especially in a Single Page Application. Here are the steps we took to guarantee a good baseline performance within our application, without compromising on the developer experience (DX).</p><h2>Establishing a baseline and setting targets</h2><blockquote><p>You can't fix what you can't measure</p></blockquote><p>There was some low-hanging fruit to improve performance, but we had one important thing to do before that - establish a baseline.</p><p>Our dashboard is JavaScript heavy, so we started by setting up analytics to track our bundle sizes. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/bundle-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next-bundle-analyzer</a> (or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webpack-bundle-analyzer</a>) provides an interactive treemap of your generated JavaScript bundles. This is our treemap when we started. It gave us a clear indication what changes we needed to achieve the most impact.</p><p><img alt="Nextjs tree analyzer" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/nextjs-tree-analyzer-6f23c1b4ea133c2504cf7b28accb70b0.png"></p><p>There are some great tools when it comes to Real User Monitoring (RUM). We chose the newly-launched <a href="https://sentry.io/for/performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry performance monitoring</a> product since we already use Sentry for error tracking and we wanted to minimize new tools in our stack. It also supports reporting <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Web Vitals</a>, the performance metrics created by Google to track initial loading performance, responsiveness and visual stability. Core Web Vitals come with recommended target values, giving us clear goals to hit.</p><p><img alt="Core Web Vitals" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/core-web-vitals-a0d3b17c36d3558584c936e3f18b83bc.png"></p><h2>Improving our JavaScript bundle size</h2><blockquote><p>How to not load the entire npm registry into our user's browsers</p></blockquote><h3>Choosing smaller modules</h3><p>We used <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bundlephobia</a> on our largest modules. This is a great website to have in your JS-performace arsenal. It gives the size of npm modules across different versions and recommends alternate modules with similar functionality which are smaller.</p><p><code>Moment.js</code> is notorious for its large bundle size and we don't need complex date processing for our dashboard. It was straightforward to switch to <a href="https://day.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">day-js</a> which is largely API-compatible with <code>Moment.js</code>. This change reduced our gzipped bundle size by 68 KB.</p><p>We migrated from <code>Joi</code> to <code>ajv</code> for our schema validation which was 32% smaller. <code>ajv</code> was already bundled as a transitive dependency of other modules, making it a no-brainer.</p><p><img alt="NPM dependencies" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/npm-dependencies-9ed695359c510422e6d9d8927589276d.png"></p><p>We reverted our <a href="https://github.com/brix/crypto-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crypto-js</a> module from version 4.0 to 3.3.0. Version 4.0 <a href="https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/issues/276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">injects more than 400kb code</a> when used in a browser context. The newer version replaces <code>Math.random</code> with node's implementation, injecting the entire node crypto module into the browser context. We use <code>crypto-js</code> for decrypting user's API keys and so we're not reliant on the randomness of the PRNG. We might move to a dedicated module like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aes-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aes-js</a> in the future since it has a much smaller surface area than <code>crypto-js</code> (in terms of security and performance).</p><h3>Using partial imports</h3><p>By selectively importing functions from modules like <code>lodash</code>, we cut the gzipped size by another 40kb across all our bundles.</p><div><div><div><div><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> _ </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> find </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash/find'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> debounce </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash/debounce'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> find</span><span>,</span><span> debounce </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'lodash'</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>In the above example, we added <a href="https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">babel-plugin-lodash</a> to our babel configuration which cherry picks the exact <code>lodash</code> functions we import. This makes it easier to import from <code>lodash</code> without cluttering the code with selective import statements.</p><h3>Moving complex logic to the server</h3><p>Thanks to some skilled haxors (well, weak passwords mainly) we had crypto miners running on some of our customer's databases. To prevent this, we enforce password strength with the <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zxcvbn</a> module. Though it improved our overall security, the module is <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=zxcvbn@4.4.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pretty big</a>, weighing in at 388kb gzipped. To get around this, we moved the password-strength checking logic to an API. Now, the frontend queries a server with a user-supplied password and the server computes its strength. This eliminates the module from the frontend.</p><h3>Lazy loading code</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xlsx</a> is another complex and large module, which is used to import spreadsheets into tables. We contemplated moving this logic to the backend, but we found another solution: lazy loading it.</p><p>The spreadsheet import is triggered when the user is creating a new table. However the code was previously loaded every time the page was visited - even when a new table was not being created. This made it a good candidate for lazy loading. Using <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js dynamic imports</a> we are able to load this component (313 kb brotlied) dynamically, whenever the user clicks the "Add content" button.</p><video width="99%" muted="" playsinline="" controls=""><source src="https://supabase.io/videos/lazy_loading.mov" type="video/mp4" muted="" playsinline=""></video><p>We use the same technique to lazy load some Lottie animations which are relatively large.</p><h3>Using native browser APIs</h3><p>We decided against supporting IE11, opening up more avenues for optimization. Using native browser APIs enabled us to drop even more dependencies. For example, since the <a href="https://caniuse.com/fetch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fetch API is available</a> in all the browsers we care about, we removed <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axios</a> and built a simple wrapper using the native fetch API.</p><h2>Improving Vercel's default caching</h2><blockquote><p>The fastest request is the request not made</p></blockquote><p>We noticed that Vercel was sending a <code>Cache-Control</code> header of <code>public, max-age=0, must-revalidate</code> , preventing some of our SVG, CSS and font files from being cached in the browser.</p><p>We updated our <code>next.config.js</code> , adding a long <code>max-age</code> to the caching header that Vercel sends. Our assets are versioned properly, so we were able to safely do this.</p><h2>Enabling Next.js Automatic Static Optimization</h2><p>Next.js is able to automatically pre-render a page to HTML, whenever a page meets some pre-conditions. This mode is called <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automatic Static Optimization</a>. Pre-rendered pages can be cached on a CDN for extremely fast page loads. We removed calls to <code>getServerSideProps</code> and <code>getInitialProps</code> to take advantage of this mode.</p><h2>Developing a performance culture</h2><blockquote><p>Always in sight, always in mind</p></blockquote><p>Our performance optimization journey will never be complete. It requires constant vigilance to maintain a baseline across our users. To instill this within our team, we took a few actions.</p><p>We developed a Slack bot which sends our Sentry performance dashboard every week, containing our slowest transactions and our Core Web Vitals summary. This shows which pages need improvement and where our <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users are the most miserable</a>.</p><p>During our transition from Alpha to Beta, performance was one of the important features, along with stability and security. We considered performance implications while choosing libraries and tools. Having a "seat at the table" in these discussions ensures that performance is not considered as an after-thought.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>With these changes, we have a respectable Core Web Vitals score. This is a snapshot from Sentry with RUM data from the last week. We are within the recommended threshold for all the 3 Web Vitals.</p><p><img alt="Sentry results" src="https://supabase.io/assets/images/sentry-results-6006d8a310931d64ef56d05f5a9f7194.png"></p><p>Our Next.js build output also shows that users download &lt; 200 kb of JavaScript between any two page transitions. We're still improving too - even though we provide a lot of functionality in our dashbaord, we will continue to reduce our bundle sizes.</p><h2>Things that did not work</h2><blockquote><p>You win some, you lose some</p></blockquote><p>We tried a VSCode plugin called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Import cost</a> which shows the size of JavaScript modules when you import it in your editor. However, the plugin did not work on our codebase since it doesn't support some JavaScript features, like optional chaining.</p><p>We also passed on using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lodash-webpack-plugin</a> even though it had the potential to reduce our JavaScript sizes, because it could potentially break our code if not used carefully. This plugin would require our frontend team to understand the Webpack configuration, updating it whenever they use a new lodash feature set.</p><h2>The road ahead</h2><p>Our broad goal is to implement best practices for frontend performance, and make it exciting to all of our team. These are some ideas we have on our roadmap -</p><ul><li>Set up <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lighthouse</a> in a Github Action to catch performance regression earlier in the development life cycle.</li><li>Continue reducing our initial JavaScript payload size, to improve our LCP time</li><li>Explore <code>cloud-mode</code> in <a href="https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segment</a> which makes API calls from the server instead of loading third-party library on the browser.</li></ul><p>Reach out to us on <a href="https://twitter.com/supabase_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> if you have more ideas to speed up our website ⚡</p></section></div>]]>

<blockquote>
<p>If I don’t make a conscious decision about how to think and what to pay attention to, I’m gonna be pissed and miserable every time… because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me.</p>

<p>– David Foster Wallance</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>David Foster Wallace </strong></a> gave this&nbsp;commencement speech to the 2005 graduating class at Kenyon College. This appears to be the only speech David Foster Wallace gave outlining his views on how to approach life generally. Time magazine has ranked <i>This Is Water</i> among the best commencement speeches ever delivered, and in 2009 it was compiled and augment <a href="https://amzn.to/2KkgWSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">into a fairly pretty book</a>.</p>
<p>In the speech, Wallace digs into higher education and what the true value of it might be. He suggests that its end-game purpose is not to teach students facts and figures or fill their heads with knowledge – but instead, it brings the most value to students by teaching them how to consciously choose how to think from a perspective that is not your own, think about meaning, and act appropriately in everyday life.</p>
<p>The topics Wallace was working through in this speech were further explored in his final novel, <a href="https://amzn.to/3niIJ4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pale King</a>, which was published in 2011, uncompleted, following his suicide.</p>

<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p>Greetings parents and congratulations to Kenyon’s graduating class of 2005.</p>
<p>There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says “Morning, boys. How’s the water?” <strong>And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?</strong>”</p>
<p>This is a standard requirement of US commencement speeches – the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre, but if you’re worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise, older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don’t be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that<strong> the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.</strong> Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude, but <strong>the fact is that in the day to day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life or death importance</strong>, or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning.</p>
<p>Of course, the main requirement of speeches like this is that I’m supposed to talk about your liberal arts education’s meaning, to try to explain why the degree you are about to receive has actual human value instead of just a material payoff. So let’s talk about the single most pervasive cliché in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about “teaching you how to think.”</p>
<p>If you’re like me as a student, you’ve never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I’m going to posit to you that the liberal arts cliché turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant <strong>education in thinking that we’re supposed to get in a place like this isn’t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about</strong>. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I’d ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious.</p>
<p>Here’s another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple of Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: <strong>the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people</strong>, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad. Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from inside the two guys. As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice. Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us. But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: <strong>blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up</strong>.</p>
<p>The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. <strong>Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded</strong>. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.</p>
<p>Here is just one example of the total wrongness of something I tend to be automatically sure of: everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the real-est, most vivid, and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our boards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of you or behind you, to the left or right of you, on your TV or your monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.</p>
<p>Please don’t worry that I’m getting ready to lecture you about compassion or other-directedness or all the so-called virtues. This is not a matter of virtue. It’s a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being “well-adjusted”, which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.</p>
<p>Given the triumphant academic setting here, an obvious question is how much of this work of adjusting our default setting involves actual knowledge or intellect. This question gets very tricky. Probably the most dangerous thing about an academic education – at least in my own case – is that it enables my tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in an abstract argument inside my head, instead of simply paying attention to what is going on right in front of me, paying attention to what is going on inside me.</p>
<p>As I’m sure you guys know by now, it is extremely difficult to stay alert and attentive, instead of getting hypnotized by the constant monologue inside your own head (which may be happening right now). Twenty years after my own graduation, I have come gradually to understand that the liberal arts cliché about teaching you how to think is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: <strong>learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think</strong>. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience. Because if you cannot exercise this kind of choice in adult life, you will be totally hosed. Think of the old cliché about “the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master.”</p>
<p>This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in the head. They shoot the terrible master. And the truth is that most of these suicides are actually dead long before they pull the trigger.</p>
<p>And I submit that this is what the real, <strong>no bullshit value of your liberal arts education is supposed to be about: how to keep from going through your comfortable, prosperous, …</strong></p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>HermiTux is a <a href="http://unikernel.org/">unikernel</a>: a minimal operating system
with low memory/disk footprint and sub-second boot time, executing an
application within a single address space on top of an hypervisor. Moreover,
HermiTux is <strong>binary-compatible</strong> with Linux: it can run native Linux
executables.</p>

<p>Although being a proof-of-concept, HermiTux supports multiple compiled (C, C++,
Fortran) and interpreted (Python, LUA) languages. It provides binary analysis
and rewriting techniques to optimize system call latency and modularize a
kernel in the presence of unmodified binaries. It supports statically and
dynamically linked programs, different compilers and optimization levels.
HermiTux also provides basic support for multithreading, debugging and
profiling.</p>

<p>HermiTux uses a lightweight KVM-based hypervisor that loads the Linux binary
alongside a minimal OS layer within a single address space virtual machine. At
runtime, system calls made by the application are caught by HermiTux’s kernel.</p>

</p>

<p>Optionally, HermiTux provides a mechanism to rewrite system call invocation
into common function calls to the kernel, significantly reducing the system
call latency.</p>

<p>HermiTux can also analyze a Linux binary to determine which system calls it
invokes, and compile a custom kernel containing only the implementations of
these particular system calls.</p>

GitHub pages are the best way to host static blogs like <code>Gatsby</code>. One of the most common ways to do this is, maintain your code in main/master branch, build it, and then push the code to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.
There are various CI that easily automate this process like Travis CI, CircleCI, etc.
With GitHub actions, this would be a piece of cake, and without depending on any third-party provider. From the docs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are not sure what are GitHub actions please visit <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">here</a>.</p>
<h2><center> Workflow </center></h2>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ol>
<li>You have a static blog(let’s say gatsby) setup, the code for your blog is in master branch.</li>
<li>You have a build script in your package.json</li>
<li>You have setup your GitHub pages (or pointed to your custom domain) in <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Process</h4>
<center><strong> Step 1 </strong></center><br>
Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages">gh-pages npm package</a> in your project, this is a small utility package which helps to publish your code to gh-pages branch.
You can skip this step in case you want to push all contents from master to <code>gh-pages</code> branch.  
<center><strong>Step 2 </strong></center><br>
Add a deploy script in your <code>package.json</code>. This script should do 2 jobs
<ol>
<li>Build the project, make it ready for being published.</li>
<li>Push the changes to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, this pushes the code to <code>gh-pages</code> via npm package.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>"deploy": "gatsby build &amp;&amp; gh-pages -d public -r https://$GH_TOKEN@github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;.git"</code></pre></div>
<center><strong>Step 3 </strong></center><br>
Generate an access token and add it to secret of your repository.
<ol>
<li>Create an access token: goto <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">https://github.com/settings/tokens</a>, create a new token, give it access for repo and workflow.  </li>
</ol>

<center><strong>Step 4 </strong></center>  
<ol>
<li>Create a workflow file, you need to create a file in following path: <code>.github/workflows/&lt;some-name-you-like&gt;.yml</code>, its important to have <code>.yml</code> extension and have exact same path.</li>
<li>
<p>Following action file is complete enough to publish <code>gh-pages</code>, every time a new commit is merged in master branch. ✅</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> gh<span>-</span>pages publisher 🚀

<span>on</span><span>:</span>
<span>push</span><span>:</span>
  <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> master <span>]</span>

<span>jobs</span><span>:</span>
<span>publish-gh-pages</span><span>:</span>
  <span>runs-on</span><span>:</span> ubuntu<span>-</span>latest
  <span>steps</span><span>:</span>
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/checkout@v2
     <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> actions/setup<span>-</span>node@v1
     <span>with</span><span>:</span>
        <span>node-version</span><span>:</span> <span>12</span>

     <span>env</span><span>:</span>
        <span>GH_TOKEN</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span>secrets.SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN<span>}</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This script is pretty self-explanatory, it performs the following tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It specifies to work only on <code>push</code> on <code>master</code></li>
<li>Sets up a <code>node 12</code> environment</li>
<li>Installs dependencies via <code>npm ci</code></li>
<li>Sets up git requirements for username and email (required to do a push to branch)</li>
<li>Run the deploy script</li>
<li>In case you don’t use gh-pages npm package, you can write another step for git push to gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>At last, we set up env variable <code>GH_TOKEN</code> from our action secret (which you set up in step 3), this env variable would be available in <code>package.json</code></li>
</ul>
<center><strong>Step 5 </strong></center><br>
Commit this file and see your first <code>action</code> in action (sorry for the pun 🙈 )
<hr>
<center>Hope this helps 🙏🙏🙏</center>
<hr>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can see the actions running here: <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository_name&gt;/actions</code>.</li>
<li>Workflow file for <a href="https://itsopensource.com/">itsopensource.com</a> can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/tsl143/itsopensource/blob/master/.github/workflows/gh-pages-publish.yml">here</a>.</li>

  <div>
    <p>In news that surprises nobody, Goodreads last week quietly announced the deprecation of their public APIs. And I mean really quietly – the only people who were told about this were those unfortunate enough to have their existing <a href="https://blog.stephanieawilkinson.com/posts/2020-12-10-yonderbook-and-goodreads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API keys disabled</a> without warning. Other than a small banner at the top of the API docs which mentions vague “plans to retire these tools”, nobody else appears to have heard anything from Goodreads, including those whose API keys remain active. So far it seems any key unused for 30 days has been disabled.</p>

<p><img src="https://joealcorn.co.uk/assets/img/posts/2020/12/deprecated.png" alt="Deprecation notice on Goodreads API documentation"></p>

<p>So this is an “announcement” much in the way a windshield announces its presence to bugs on a highway, and with the same consequences: dead bugs. Some developers have taken to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/21788520-api-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API discussion boards</a> and blogs, but the overall impression I’m getting is grim acceptance. Really the surprising thing is how long it took them: Amazon has been in charge at Goodreads for almost 8 years now, and I think we’ve all been expecting this to come at some point.</p>

<p>So why now? What’s changed? Well, the fact is the market’s changing – and Goodreads isn’t. Alternative options are starting to emerge, and since Goodreads has forgotten how to innovate, it wants to use its market position to stifle innovation instead.</p>

<p>The sad thing is it really only hurts the hobbyist projects and Goodreads users themselves. Anybody seriously attempting to compete with Goodreads is well aware of the Amazon-shaped elephant in the room and is likely prepared. It’s the users and the hackers that this move will harm, and if anything it further reinforces the need for viable alternatives.</p>

<p>Personally I’m going to continue pouring my efforts into building <a href="https://beta.readng.co/?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">readng</a>. I’m already using it to keep track of my reads &amp; collections, along with a few thousand beta testers. I’m really excited by our plans and think we have the right team to execute, but we also need a shift in consumer behaviour.</p>

<p>The web has to mature beyond advertising as a business model. For this to happen people are going to have to open their wallets, pay for the services they use, and support independent businesses. That’s how we build a web where indies can thrive - one that’s more village centre than financial centre. I think the shift is underway.</p>


<hr>

<p>PS: <a href="https://beta.readng.co/user/joe?utm_source=joealcorn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here’s my own readng profile</a>. You should probably use our Goodreads importer while our API key works, huh?</p>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>We will achieve this using what appears to be a relatively unknown Jupyter extension called <a href="https://github.com/kaibaesler/xdiag_magic_extension">xdiag_magic</a> which provides custom magic functions for generating diagrams with <a href="http://blockdiag.com/en/">blockdiag</a>. Unfortunately, it isn't as straight-forward as entering <code>conda install ...</code> to get it up and running, but it's still quite easy.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>These instructions assume you already have Jupyter Lab up and running, with your environment of choice activated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Clone or Download <a href="https://github.com/shahinrostami/xdiag_magic_extension">this mirrored repository</a> to your your machine. Make sure to extract it if you download it as a ZIP archive.</li>
<li>Using the command line, navigate to the <code>xidag_magic_extension</code> directory, e.g. using <code>cd</code>.</li>
<li>Once you're inside the directory, make sure you are within the desired environment, e.g. if you're using conda make sure you type <code>conda activate &lt;environment_name&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li>
<li>Type <code>pip install -e .</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
    <p>Be sure not to delete the <code>xidag_magic_extension</code> directory after installing it. If it's deleted, it will need to be re-installed as the extension will run from this directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<p>To test it, launch Jupyter Lab and open or create a notebook. You need to run the following code before generating any diagrams.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[3]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>%</span><span>reload_ext</span> xdiag_magic
<span>%</span><span>xdiag_output_format</span> svg</pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>Then you can visit <a href="http://blockdiag.com/en/blockdiag/examples.html">blockdiag's examples</a> and try running some of their example diagrams to see the output. Your diagram code must appear in a Jupyter Lab Code cell, and be surrounded with the following.</p>

<p><i>The Google Bug Tracker helps them(Google) in tracking through different bugs and security issues, but Gopal, a highly skilled security researcher managed to leverage and pilferage Google through its own issue tracker, isn't it quite creative? A defensive mechanism, since the same tool is used to track and patch security issues was implemented to pervade through Google's protection.</i></p>

<p>
&nbsp;Every organisation have bug trackers, in fact, for example most companies use external ones like Jira bug tracker to track and resolve bugs, so what makes Google's case unique in particular is their custom tailored Issue Tracker and it's features. Security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/gopalsinghcse" target="_blank">Gopal </a>discovered that although Google had in the past attempted to fix several security issues in their Bug Tracker, yet, it was unsafe and indeed his firm conviction led to him finding a different issue, that can be called a regression but nevertheless, he bypassed Google's previous fix proving the fact - No system can be made "secure" (completely), no matter what amount of patches you make, this again shows the need for bug bounties to motivate and attract highly talented talented individuals as Gopal, and also motivates security researchers to use offensive methods as the one mentioned in this case, and keep trying harder to circumvent all security measures kept in place, even previous patches.</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------</p>

<h2>
<span><span>How I managed to get a Google organisation email, bypassing their previous patch!</span></span></h2>
</div>
<p>
I came across this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/messing-with-the-google-buganizer-system-for-15-600-in-bounties-58f86cc9f9a5" target="_blank">writeup</a> by&nbsp;<a data-action-type="hover" data-action-value="7fa68cbc850e" data-action="show-user-card" data-anchor-type="2" data-href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan" data-user-id="7fa68cbc850e" href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan" target="_blank">Alex</a>. I started testing the issue tracker, and I wanted to see if I could somehow manage to get an @google.com Account. In the issue tracker, I found the&nbsp;<i>browse components feature. </i>There&nbsp;were two public issue trackers, I clicked on Android Public Tracker</p>
<p>
Bugs reported to <i>Android </i>showed up here. To report a Bug in Android public issue tracker you may simply send an email to-</p>
<p><span>buganizer-system+</span><em>componentID</em><span>@google.com</span></p>
<p>
In this case, android’s component id is <b>190923</b>.</p>
<p>
The issue I made, got listed in the public issue tracker. I got a confirmation email from&nbsp;<span>buganizersystem+my_email@google.com&nbsp;</span>and hence, replies to the email would be directed to-</p>
<p><span>buganizer-system+</span><em>componentID</em><span><em>+</em></span><em>issueID</em><span>@google.com</span></p>
<p>
I replied to that email and comment was posted in the conversation. I can add google email to see if I can get a confirmation code, to test this I clicked on&nbsp;<a data-href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Forwarding and POP/IMAP</a>&nbsp;in Gmail settings and added the google email to the forwarding email address. I was surprised to see I got a confirmation code in the Android public issue tracker.</p>
<p>
There are two parts here, to get a google account.&nbsp;<span>Signup</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>verification</span>. I can verify a google account, but I could not signup for a @google.com account so my report got closed as <i>Won’t Fix. Bummer!</i></p>
<figure id="aa11" name="aa11"><div>


</div>
</figure><figure id="272e" name="272e"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
Then I started visiting every subdomain of Google to see if I could use google.com email to signup and this new signup page appeared.</p>
<figure id="98a9" name="98a9"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
I could feel my heartbeats racing, after coming across this new signup page. I signed up using the bug…@google.com email and then it asked me to verify by entering the code.</p>
<h3 id="295b" name="295b">
Verifying The email&nbsp;address</h3>
<p>
I was waiting for the verification code in the conversation and then received the verification code in the mail.</p>
<figure id="85a3" name="85a3"><div>

</figure><figure id="bd07" name="bd07"><div>


</div>

<p>
After successfully signing up for the Google Account, I reopened the issue.</p>
<p><span>Nice catch!</span></p>
<figure id="18b4" name="18b4"><div>


</div>
</figure>
<p>
Finally, at 9:50 PM that day, the most awaited email arrived&nbsp;<span>$3133.70</span>. I could not sleep the whole night.</p>

  <article>
  <p>Haskell Object Observation Debugger (HOOD) is a small post-mortem
debugger for the lazy functional language
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. It is based on the concept of
observation of intermediate data structures, rather than the more
traditional stepping and variable examination paradigm used by
imperative language debuggers.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Observation of base types (Int, Bool, Float, etc)</li>
  <li>Observation of both finite and infinite structures (Lists, trees,
arrays, etc).</li>
  <li>Observation of usage patterns for functions.</li>
  <li>Observation of monadic actions, including IO actions.</li>
  <li>Hooks to add observational capabilities for new base type and used
defined types.</li>
  <li>Programmable browsing capabilities - structure browsers can be coded
and plugged in.</li>
  <li>Includes a basic structure rendering package that uses a
Haskell-like syntax.</li>
  <li>Thread-safe observations are are supported.</li>
  <li>Supports observations on exceptions (on certain compilers).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Hood can observe data structures:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main = runO ex2

ex2 = print
      . reverse
      . (observe "intermediate")
      . reverse
      $ [0..9]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program gives this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

-- intermediate
  9 : 8 : 7 : 6 : 5 : 4 : 3 : 2 : 1 : 0 : []
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hood can also observe functions, showing both the arguments and result
of each call:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>main = runO ex9

ex9 = print $ observe "foldl (+) 0 [1..4]" foldl (+) 0 [1..4]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this program gives this output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>10

-- foldl (+) 0 [1..4]
  { \ { \ 0 1  -&gt; 1
      , \ 1 2  -&gt; 3
      , \ 3 3  -&gt; 6
      , \ 6 4  -&gt; 10
      } 0 (1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : []) 
       -&gt; 10
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that Hood preserves the type and strictness properties of the
function under observation. If an argument is not examined in the
function, it remains unevaluated. As an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ghci&gt; runO $ print $ observe "sum xs" (\ xs ys -&gt; sum xs) [0..2] [0..]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that ys is left unevaluated (denoted by the underscore):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>3

-- sum xs
  { \ (0 : 1 : 2 : []) _  -&gt; 3
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>Hood was developed at OGI, in 1999, for GHC 4.X. We are looking into a
debugging toolkit for Haskell and Lava, so we ported Hood to GHC 6.X,
and re-released it on hackage. We hope you find it useful.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607775961422/elXIChWIZ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div><div><div><p>Subscribe to <!-- -->my<!-- --> newsletter and never miss <!-- -->my<!-- --> upcoming articles</p></div></div></div><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into Horcruxing, here's a quick prologue on online security hygiene. You can skip to the  <a href="#double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Horcruxing section</a>  if it seems redundant.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-strong-online-security">Rules for Strong Online Security</h3>
<p>1.
<strong>Longer passwords (atleast 16 characters) are better than shorter ones</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; cutesamantha15101995 &gt; cutesamantha
</code></pre><p>2.
<strong>Randomized passwords are better than personally identifiable passwords</strong></p>
<pre><code>=&gt; process-cancel-stingy-garnet &gt; cutesamantha15101995
</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE: </strong> <code>process-cancel-stingy-garnet</code> is technically a passphrase - basically an easy-to-remember password in comparison to randomized strings like <code>B6fSpxMj&amp;f6DU@5^k</code></p>
<p>3.
<strong>Have a <em>significantly</em> different password for each account</strong></p>
<p>Having the same password for different accounts is like using the same key for different locks. It beats the whole point of having multiple locks! Also, having different passwords but with only one easily guessable word different (like the ones below) still poses the same risk. The passwords should be <strong><em>significantly</em></strong> different.</p>
<pre><code>bounce-unfold-stunning-chute        process-cancel-stingy-facebook
symptom-untouched-unpaid-arena  &gt;   process-cancel-stingy-twitter
sediment-tweak-annually-koala       process-cancel-stingy-gmail
</code></pre><p>4.
<strong>Use 2FA/MFA wherever possible</strong></p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook offer a 2FA feature where you need the second factor only when you login from a new device or a new location, instead of needing 2FA every time. That's a rare combination of convenience &amp; security right there! 
Most other sites also offer some variation of 2FA.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Use the  <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp">andOTP</a>  (or any other) app's TOTP as the second factor since it cannot be spoofed or spied on lock-screen like the SMS OTP and does not require a mobile network or internet connection. You can also use Biometrics (finger print or face recognition)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woah! How do I create a long password for each of the bazillion websites out there, <em>and</em> have them significantly different <em>and</em> remember them? Security seems like such a pain in the ass!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="enter-password-manager">[enter] <strong>PASSWORD MANAGER</strong></h3>
<p>A password manager helps you manage all your passwords in one place, either in the form of a browser extension, mobile app, or website. Good password managers will offer a browser extension and a mobile app with one-click auto-fill-login-page feature by removing the hassle of copy pasting or typing your login details. A few smart ones even detect phishing pages and warn you indirectly, by not showing the login details for such web pages.</p>
<p>They enable all the above measures for strong online security with ease. While I agree it takes some effort to set it up for the very first time. But, after that, it just flows like butter. </p>
<p><br>
For example, password generator in <a target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com/">BitWarden</a> lets you custom design your random password in different flavours.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770748804/m93T3kqUH.png?auto=compress" alt="BitWarden's password generator"></p>
<h3 id="yay-im-secure">YAY! I'm Secure!</h3>
<p>You meticulously move all your passwords and secrets to a trusted password manager. Finally, you can rest easy knowing that your digital life is truly secure. Or, is it?  <br></p>
<p><strong>What if </strong></p><ul>
<li>your master password (the password to your password manager) is compromised due to a security breach or you left it in plaintext on a post-it/ email/ notes app</li>
<li>someone gained temporary access to your unlocked system (computer or phone) when you stepped away to get that last coffee for the day and your password manager is still logged in for everyone to see</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer: you're <strong><em>screwed</em></strong>. The cost of putting all your eggs in one basket is that it could all go into oblivion in one fell swoop. How do you overcome this challenge now? </p>
<h3 id="double-blind-passwords-aka-horcruxing">Double Blind Passwords (aka Horcruxing)</h3>
<p>For all his faults, Voldemort did one good thing for us muggles. He gave us the concept of a horcrux. For the uninitiated, a horcrux is any object in which you store a piece of your soul, putting the proverbial eggs of your soul into different baskets, to gain quasi-immortality. </p>
<p><strong>The basic idea</strong>: You split your password into 2 parts - one which is stored in the password manager, and the other which is stored in your head (aka horcrux).</p>
<p>Basically, at any given point in time, you and your password manager know only a piece of the password. It's double-blind. In effect, just like You-Know-Who, you're splitting your password (soul) into pieces and storing them in different places.</p>
<h4 id="before">BEFORE</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: rollthepeople1732</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="after">AFTER</h4>
<pre><code>
<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venus</span>


<span>horcrux: papel</span>


<span>username: rick</span>
<span>password: roll-the-people-venuspapel</span>
</code></pre><p>The horcrux adds an additional layer of security that only you can unlock. It's a kind of 2FA. Again, the longer the horcrux the better. But, a simple word should also be fine as long as only you know the horcrux.</p>
<p>If it feels like too much effort, use a horcrux only for the most important logins - your social media, bank accounts etc. </p>
<h3 id="one-last-thing">One Last Thing</h3>
<p>Security is never absolute. One can try to secure a system as tightly as possible, but never really say that it is fully secure (if you see someone claiming otherwise, it's mostly marketing bullshit). If we cannot make systems completely secure, the next best thing to do is to make them as secure as possible and a good way to do it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing">Defense In Depth</a> - basically make sure that even if one layer of security is breached, there exist other layers to mitigate further damage - which is what we've tried to achieve all along.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>1.
Use a good password manager </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use BitWarden (since it is open source and costs just $10 a year for the PRO features)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.
Use TOTP/ biometrics instead of SMS-based OTP</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use andOTP (since it is open source)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.
Use a horcrux (a double-blind password) for the most important logins</p>

<p>P.S. Keep in mind that horcruxing only works fine until you connect your brain to NeuraLink and accidentally upload your thoughts online for everyone to see. :P</p>

  <section>
    
    

    <p>by Francis Tseng</p>

<p>The application that introduced peer-to-peer (P2P) computing to the mainstream was file sharing, services like Napster, Kazaa, Gnutella, and BitTorrent. For me, these programs were the first time the contradiction of artificial scarcity—the imposed scarcity of infinitely replicable digital information—and the excessive measures that were used to enforce it became startlingly clear. Over time, I encountered the term P2P in other settings and alongside other ideas—democratic governance, communalism, autonomy, cooperatives—and I started to see the purchase this idea had beyond file sharing and networking protocols.</p>

<p><a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/the-p2p-foundation/about-the-p2p-foundation">The P2P Foundation’s mission and strategic priorities</a>, for example, extend the early P2P ideas of open culture and exchange into values of cooperative living and regenerative production. <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/principles/">Scuttlebutt, a more recent P2P social networking protocol, has its own “principles stack”</a> that similarly advocates pluralistic exchange and mutual interdependence. It’s beautiful how, at least in the ideal scenario, by using a P2P service we are helping others access it as well. P2P is both an acknowledgment of our shared needs and an example of how cooperation helps us fulfill those needs.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve followed along with P2P projects because of these shared values, and I always find it exciting when new projects emerge. It seems that P2P is experiencing something of a renaissance, likely due to the frenzy around blockchain (which purports to offer something similar to P2P) and the increasing popular anxiety around centralized internet services like Facebook.</p>

<p>Urbit, “<a href="https://urbit.org/">a personal server built from scratch</a>,” first came across my radar a couple of years ago. Urbit positions itself as a P2P project, but it stands out in contrast to other P2P projects, mainly because the person behind it, Curtis Yarvin, seems antithetical to what I understand P2P to represent.</p>

<p>My central question is this: <em>Is Urbit a project that should be supported?</em></p>

<p>We can further break this down into two parts. First, Urbit’s marketing materials correctly identify that concentrated data aggregation and decision-making power are fundamental issues of the internet-as-we-know-it. Twitter’s persistent neglect of harassment on its platform is one everyday example. It is clear that new protocols and platforms that reduce our dependency on distant power are needed to challenge these issues. What’s less clear, though, is whether or not Urbit actually offers a meaningful alternative. Does Urbit genuinely enable new kinds of relations? Or, does it merely replace the old aristocracy with a new one?</p>

<p>The second, and more urgent, question is: who and what are we supporting by supporting Urbit? Many people in tech still believe that technology can be divorced from its creators; however, those of us in tech need to recognize that we have a considerable amount of influence over which products enter the mainstream consciousness, which products get created at all, and who receives both financial and social capital (shout out to <a href="https://techworkerscoalition.org/">Tech Workers Coalition</a> et al.). For example, consider Peter Thiel , who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook. Early support of PayPal and Facebook contributed to their financial success, which developed Thiel’s influence and made him quite rich. Thiel then turned that money and influence into Palantir Technologies, a software company that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/02/palantir-provides-the-engine-for-donald-trumps-deportation-machine/">develops technologies to help expand surveillance and deportation for the government</a>. We have to consider what similar groundwork we help to lay by supporting Urbit.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In order to discuss Urbit’s design, we need to have an understanding of the politics of its creator, Curtis Yarvin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a> is innocuously described on Wikipedia as an “American political theorist and computer scientist,” but to many, he is better known as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/">one of the intellectual forebears of the alt-right</a>. From 2007 to 2014<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, working under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin writings, which among other things espoused anti-democratic ideas and scientific racism and helped introduce many of what are now understood as the alt-right’s foundational ideologies to a wider public. The term “red pill,” which describes the process of reactionary radicalization and the community around it, was first used in this way by Yarvin.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Defenders of Urbit are quick to dismiss any inclusion of Yarvin’s politics in discussions about Urbit as unfair or irrelevant, and might point out that Yarvin left the project in January of this year.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> However, given that Yarvin basically laid out the general design for Urbit independently, as he worked on it alone for 11 years<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and in parallel with his political writings<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, and that Urbit, as a P2P project, is a fundamentally social and thus incorporates ideas about how people should be organized, Yarvin’s politics should be considered as something that influences his design decisions and his long-term vision for the project. <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/z5j1hq/urbit_2017#c_4z4gik">Dog-whistles</a> have been identified in some of his writing about Urbit and its design, including his <a href="https://urbit.org/posts/essays/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">leaning on Nazi philosopher Carl Schmitt</a> for questions around Urbit’s governance.</p>

<p>To save space I’ll provide only a very brief overview of Yarvin’s political philosophy—if you like, you can read more about it <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/mouthbreathing-machiavellis">here</a>, <a href="https://www.viewpointmag.com/2017/03/28/the-darkness-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-artificial-intelligence-and-neoreaction/">here</a>, <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">here</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yavin refers to his brand of political philosophy as “neocameralism.” Neocameralism, as described in his essay “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/08/against-political-freedom/">Against Political Freedom</a>,” is a political philosophy arguing that state should be run like a business, (i.e., with a CEO at its head and no democratic mechanisms). His ideas are credited as being foundational to the “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/">neoreactionary” movement</a>, which could be described as a neo-monarchist movement (though Yarvin himself doesn’t identify as a “monarchist” because of its association with a constitutional monarchy and not absolute monarchy). In the neoreactionary movement, “divine right” is supplanted with “genetic right” based on scientific racism reframed as “human biodiversity.” Yarvin’s writings are also popular within the right-libertarian sects of Silicon Valley, such as <a href="https://thebaffler.com/latest/the-moldbug-variations-pein">with Peter Thiel</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14671978/alt-right-mencius-moldbug-urbit-curtis-yarvin-tlon">Peter Thiel also has a stake in Tlön</a>, Yarvin’s company which develops Urbit, via Thiel’s VC firm, Founders Fund). The point here is that Yarvin is not a fringe philosopher. His writings have influence over people with considerable power and contributes to the intellectual miasma that emboldens and normalizes anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, misogynistic, and racist policies and attacks.</p>

<h2 id="urbit">Urbit</h2>
<h4 id="a-self-sovereign-internet">A self-sovereign internet</h4>

<p>Urbit positions itself as infrastructure for self-sovereignty in the digital age, liberating people from ceding control of their data to corporations.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> The core idea is that Urbit helps you run a personal server that acts as an intermediary between you and other services, including existing services like Facebook (yes, there is a lot more to Urbit—such as its reinvention of parts of the lower-level computational stack—but its P2P layer is what’s of interest here).</p>

<p>Self-sovereignty is an important principle, and I wager that many who regularly use the internet would agree that more of it is valuable for a healthy internet: for being able to control who can access your data, who can and cannot contact you, and so on. <em>But</em>, self-sovereignty is far too vague of a concept on its own. Left- and right-libertarianism both start with self-sovereignty as a core value, but they end up with vastly different conceptions of what meaningful self-sovereignty looks like and how it can be achieved. Left-libertarianism finds that self-sovereignty arises from social organizing, care, and democratic governance, which build towards positive freedoms (freedom to learn, to flourish, and so on); whereas, right-libertarianism believes it comes from the market and that negative freedoms (freedom from restrictions and regulation) are the goal. Though Yarvin does not identify as a libertarian (he is, in his own words, sympathetic to it), his neocameralism is right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> of corporate tyranny and serfdom.</p>

<p>To draw an example that you might be familiar with, consider the Twitter-alternative, Gab, which markets itself as a bastion for free speech. Gab, in practice, operates as a niche platform for members of the far-right who have been banned from Twitter: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/gab-robert-bowers-pittsburgh-synagogue-shootings.html">a haven for white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists</a>”. We might ask then, is Gab a platform for free speech, or is it a platform for hate speech? Who’s speech does Gab prioritize? It quickly becomes clear that the concept of “free speech” that Gab deploys is not quite the same as what others see it to mean.</p>

<p>In a similar way, this slipperiness of self-sovereignty as a concept, especially in light of Yarvin’s political writings, makes me suspicious of what it really means in the context of Urbit. Is Urbit actually designed to give users more autonomy and control? Does it restore any power to internet users?</p>

<p>One central design feature of Urbit is its network hierarchy. As a participant in Urbit, you may be a galaxy (the top of the hierarchy), a star (which fall under galaxies), or a planet (which fall under stars). The description of this hierarchy <a href="https://github.com/cgyarvin/urbit/blob/6ac688960687aa9c89d4da6fff49a3125c10aca1/Spec/urbit/3-intro.txt">used to use explicitly feudal metaphors</a> as part of what Yarvin called “digital feudalism,” with himself as the “prince,” and further contributes to my suspicion of Yarvin’s conception of self-sovereignty actually entails.</p>

<p>In trying to backpedal on these naming conventions, Yarvin claims that his ideas about governance are flipped for the internet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the real world today is governed as an insanely dysfunctional republic, and the Internet today is governed as a cluster of insanely despotic corporate monarchies, it doesn’t strike me as at all inconsistent with historical thought to treat the former case of misgovernment with efficient monarchism, and the latter case with liberating republicanism.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/2020/11/21/kde-introducing-kopeninghours.html">KOpeningHours</a>,
a new library to parse and interpret <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours">OSM opening hours</a>
expressions. Here is now how we make use of this in <a href="https://apps.kde.org/en/itinerary">KDE Itinerary</a>.</p>

<h3 id="highlight-open-entities">Highlight Open Entities</h3>

<p>Based on your travel bookings KDE Itinerary knows when and for how long you are going to be at a train station or airport.
Combined with now understanding opening hours information we can determine which shop, restaurant, amenity or other entity is
open during that time span. Things closed for your entire stay will be grayed out on the station map.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/72/kde-itinerary-station-map-closed-entities.png" alt="Train station map using colored icons for open shops/restaurants/amenities, and gray ones for those closed ones.">
  
  <figcaption>Shops, restaurants or amenities closed during a layover are grayed out.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This of course is most useful at very large stations or airports and shorter layovers, where walking longer distances in vain
would be rather inconvenient.</p>

<h3 id="human-readable-opening-hours">Human-readable Opening Hours</h3>

<p>Another place where we made use of this is the information dialog for a selected element on the map.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://www.volkerkrause.eu/assets/posts/72/kde-itinerary-station-map-opening-hours-details.png" alt="Opening hours information for a selected element on the map presented both in textual and visual form.">
  
  <figcaption>Textual description of the current opening state and visual overview of the current week.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two things in here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A textual description of the current state and the next state change. This is the information you are most likely
looking for regarding the opening time.</li>
  <li>A visual representation of the current week. The benefit of that might be less obvious for simple opening hours
expressions like <code>Mo-Fr 09:00-17:00</code>, but as soon as they get slightly more complex interpreting that manually becomes
tricky and potentially error prone. Consider for example the simple <code>PH off</code> (closed on public holidays) addition.
In your home region you likely know when there is a public holiday, in other countries you might encounter
surprises though (remember e.g. Akademy 2018).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3>

<p>At this point I considered the opening hours topic sufficiently covered, just leaving the
<a href="https://marc.info/?t=160761966300016&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">standard KDE review process</a>
to be done for integrating this into the 21.04 release service.</p>

<p>Then I however got contacted by an OSM contributor, who, after having imported the opening hours
of all French post offices into OSM and finding himself confronted with a number of false-positive
warnings by the OSM validator, was looking into improving the
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose">Osmose OSM validator</a>
for opening hours expressions. KOpeningHours was apparently performing quite well during an evaluation for this,
and is therefore <a href="https://github.com/osm-fr/osmose-backend/issues/555">being considered as a parser for the validator</a>.</p>

<p>The requirements on the parser for validation are higher than for the evaluation use I had
originally in mind. Rejecting to evaluate things we aren’t certain about is enough for KDE Itinerary’s use,
however a validator shouldn’t produce false positives and also needs to accepts all kinds of rare edge cases
correctly. This has already resulted in a number of improvements to KOpeningHours, which of course
also benefit KDE Itinerary.</p>

<p>Said OSM contributor is a certain David Faure btw, the world is very small.</p>

  <p>James Crabtree is an associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. He is the author of “The Billionaire Raj.”</p>
</div>


<p>SINGAPORE —&nbsp;Back in August, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with a group of economists in Beijing. “In the coming period, we will face more and more headwinds,” he <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/25/c_139314902.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">explained</a>, using unusually blunt language. Without naming names, Xi talked about China’s worsening trade and technology war with the United States under President Donald Trump, set against a backdrop of growing certainty in Beijing that America is bent on containing his nation’s geopolitical rise.</p>



<p>But then came the interesting part. “Since the beginning of this year, I have said on many occasions that we must promote the formation of a new development pattern, in which domestic and international cycles are the mainstay, and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other,” Xi said. To an outsider, this might seem unremarkable, cloaked as it is in the elliptical phraseology that often marks Chinese economic ideas. But the “dual circulation” strategy Xi outlined actually represents a radical new understanding of globalization and of China’s place within it.</p>



<p>More than just a buzzword, dual circulation describes the deeply pessimistic worldview that has settled over Beijing. Once China’s leaders saw opportunity in globalization. Now, they expect the U.S. and its allies to deny China the technology it needs to build “a modern socialist country” by mid-century, meaning a wealthy superpower fit to rival the U.S. Although likely to be less pugilistic, Beijing rightly believes an incoming Biden administration will also press forward with policies designed to stop advanced technologies finding their way into Beijing’s hands. Chinese thinking has long valorized self-reliance, dating back to ideas developed by former Chinese leader Mao Zedong during the country’s civil war, which ended with the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Now, Trump’s tariffs, as well as his campaigns against companies like Huawei and TikTok, have given new impetus to the modern form of self-reliance Xi dubs “internal” development.</p>



<p>Many experts have noted a changing Western consensus on China, as leaders in Washington abandoned the idea that economic modernization would inevitably lead to political liberalization in Beijing. But there has been a comparable shift in China’s internal conversation on the West too. Beginning with semiconductors but potentially expanding to all manner of other areas, China now expects it will have to develop technologically on its own. Xi’s new theory now sits at the heart of the country’s <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-10/29/c_139476451.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">14th five-year plan</a>, which covers development from 2021 to 2025, and was unveiled in draft form in October. The result will accelerate China’s decoupling from the West, while also increasing the importance of trading links forged with other parts of the world — for instance, via Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative. Put more bluntly, while the world was distracted by the drama of the U.S. presidential election, Xi quietly unveiled an economic strategy fit for a new Cold War. Both for China and for globalization itself, the results are likely to be profound.&nbsp;</p>

      “China expects the U.S. and its allies to act ever more aggressively to deny China the technology it needs.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<hr>



<p>To see how much China’s consensus has changed, recall Xi’s <a href="https://america.cgtn.com/2017/01/17/full-text-of-xi-jinping-keynote-at-the-world-economic-forum" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">remarks</a> at Davos in 2017. There, he portrayed globalization not as a threat, but as an inevitability. “The global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from,” he suggested. “China will vigorously foster an external environment of opening-up for common development.” Just as Trump was turning against the idea, China would act as steward of the existing global order. It would even help to remedy many of the problems that rapid integration had caused, Xi argued, from economic inequality to climate change.</p>



<p>Three years later and, under <a href="https://research.nus.edu.sg/eai/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/EAIC-20-20201020.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">dual circulation</a>, things look much different. The idea splits the world into two systems. First comes external circulation, meaning China’s global trade, but also the way it invites foreigners into its domestic economy. This was the focus of Xi’s Davos remarks and the approach that powered his country’s decades of rapid growth, transforming China into an exporting powerhouse. The second component is then internal circulation, meaning domestic demand from Chinese consumers, but also domestic supply chains and “made in China” technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This division shares something in common with “<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/40-years-of-china-opening-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">reform and opening up</a>,” a phrase that has dominated China’s economic thinking for decades. That idea suggested Beijing should reform its domestic (or internal) economy to make it more market-led, while also opening up to the (external) world via globalization, gaining new ideas, production techniques and technologies along the way. Dual circulation also echoes longstanding attempts to wean China off a growth model dominated by exports and infrastructure investment and build instead the kind of consumption-led economy common in rich countries.</p>



<p>Such attempts have been only partially successful. A decade ago, about <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China's%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">34%</a> of China’s economy came via domestic consumption, less than <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/final-consumption-expenditure-etc-percent-of-gdp-wb-data.html#:~:text=(%25%20of%20GDP)%20in%20United,compiled%20from%20officially%20recognized%20sources." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">half the level</a> in the U.S. at the time. By 2019, this has reached just <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/china/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=China%20Private%20Consumption%3A%20%25%20of%20GDP,-1952%20%2D%202019%20%7C%20Yearly&amp;text=China%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted%20for,an%20average%20share%20of%2049.7%20%25." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">39%</a> — progress, of a sort, but hardly dramatic. When the phrase dual circulation first emerged earlier this year, many saw it as merely yet one more push toward this long-term objective of Chinese internal economic rebalancing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is China’s deteriorating geopolitical environment that marks dual circulation as a decisive break from the past, however. “China thinks there is a good prospect of even worse relations with the U.S. and its friends in the coming years,” I was told recently by Li Mingjiang, a Chinese political scientist based in Singapore and long-time observer of Beijing’s intricate political economy. “So, it needs to do something about it.”</p>



<p>It is not hard to see why. Trump’s tariffs and battles over soybeans generated more headlines, but it is advanced technology that really matters in Beijing. China is a global tech leader in some sectors, from online payments to artificial intelligence. But it lags in others. Despite its geopolitical heft, it still remains a firmly middle-income economy, with a gross domestic product per capita of roughly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=china+gdp+per+capita&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;oq=china+gdp&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i67l3j0j69i60j69i61.4682j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$9,700</a> — about on par with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Kazakhstan</a> and roughly half that of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG865SG865&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03pfVp34z407DFWSFnQvjkGHb2akQ%3A1605820539834&amp;ei=e-C2X7m2Munfz7sP5ZGlgAE&amp;q=kazakhstan+gdp+per+capita&amp;oq=Ka+gdp+per+capita&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB46BAgAEEdQoaoBWMmrAWCUswFoAHADeAGAAesBiAGeApIBBTEuMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=psy-ab" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Greece</a>. Access to cutting-edge technology is critical in changing this, especially as its economy moves away from the kind of basic exported manufactured goods that have long dominated its growth model.</p>



<p>Over recent decades, China has had many routes to acquiring such technology. Often, it simply bought it, as when Chinese companies snapped up everything from Rolls Royce jet engines to Qualcomm semiconductors. Foreign businesses rushed to set up Chinese operations, often as part of local joint ventures, eager to tap into a vast consumer market. Chinese businesses bought foreign technology groups, while Chinese academics and scientists built partnerships at the world’s best universities. Beijing <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">employed</a> darker methods too, from forced technology transfer to outright intellectual property theft. But there were always plenty of legitimate avenues to go with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, many of these routes are closing fast. Rather than tariffs, America’s “entity list” has proved its most potent weapon. Back in 2016, President Barack Obama first used this process in <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/publications/getting-beyond-forced-technology-transfers-analysis-and-recommendations-intangible" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">accusing</a> ZTE, China’s second-largest telecoms supplier, of selling U.S. technologies to Iran, crippling the Chinese company in the process. Trump then escalated this approach, banning U.S. businesses from trading with dozens of Chinese enterprises, from state-owned giants to niche artificial intelligence providers with links to Xinjiang and its embattled Muslim Uighur minority. More recent <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/08/commerce-department-further-restricts-huawei-access-us-technology-and" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">measures</a> unveiled this August hit foreign suppliers too, for instance stopping semiconductor operators in Taiwan from selling to Chinese entities. Huawei has been one high-profile victim, leading experts to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdd2a70f-ecd2-4aff-b6c7-c0624bfdeebb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">question</a> whether China’s state-linked tech champion can survive.</p>



<p>What started with semiconductors is unlikely to end there, however, hence dual circulation’s underlying pessimism. Under Trump, the U.S. has unveiled a range of further measures limiting China’s technology access, from its 2018 <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/briefings/2018/02/the_export_controlreformactof2018risksan.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Export Control Reform Act</a> to more targeted measures in areas like geospatial imagery software. Allies in Europe are being cajoled to follow suit. Many Western governments have also acted to stop China from buying up advanced tech companies entirely, while also <a href="https://www.chinacenter.net/2020/china_currents/19-3/scholars-or-spies-u-s-china-tension-in-academic-collaboration/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">limiting</a> academic collaborations with Chinese partners. The recent battle over TikTok was illustrative too, showing how rapidly the U.S. has lowered the bar on what counts as a national security threat, a category that now includes not just critical 5G telecoms architecture of the sort provided by Huawei, but also jocular teenage social media platforms.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, U.S. strategists are particularly vexed by China’s doctrine of “<a href="https://www.floridadaily.com/marco-rubio-introduces-bill-to-keep-chinese-military-companies-from-accessing-american-capital-markets/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">military-civil fusion</a>,” which mandates that technologies acquired by China’s private sector must be shared with its armed forces. The problem is that, when you look hard enough, almost anything can potentially be seen as a dual-use technology, from nuclear equipment and renewable energy batteries to civilian aircraft, drones and autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As we noted above, the primary goal of OSv is to run existing Linux software, because most MIKELANGELO use cases required running existing code. Today’s Linux APIs – POSIX system calls, socket API, etc. – were formed by decades of Unix and Linux legacy, and some aspects of them are inherently inefficient. OSv can improve the performance of applications which use these APIs, but not dramatically. So our second goal in the development of the guest operating system was to propose new APIs which will offer new applications dramatically better performance than unmodified Linux applications – provided that the application is rewritten to use these new APIs,</p>
<p>In the research paper “OSv — Optimizing the Operating System for Virtual Machines”[<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>], one of the benchmarks used was Memcached, a popular cloud application used for caching of frequently requested objects to lower the load on slower database servers. Memcached demonstrated how an unmodified network application can run faster on OSv than it does on Linux – a 22% speedup was reported in the paper.</p>
<p>22% is a nice speedup that we get just by replacing Linux in the guest by OSv, without modifying the application at all. But we wanted to understand if there is something we could do to get significantly higher performance. When we profiled memcached on OSv, we quickly discovered two performance bottlenecks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inefficiencies inherent in the Posix API</strong>, so OSv cannot avoid them and still remain POSIX compatible: For example, in one benchmark we noticed that 20% of the memcached runtime was locking and unlocking mutexes – almost always uncontended. For every packet we send or receive, we lock and unlock more than a dozen mutexes. Part of OSv’s performance advantage over Linux is that OSv uses a “netchannel” design for the network stack reducing locks (see the previous section), but we still have too many of them, and the Posix API forces us to leave many of them: For example, the Posix API allows many threads to use the same socket, allows many threads to modify the list of file descriptors, to poll the same file descriptors – so all these critical operations involve locks, that we cannot avoid. The socket API is also synchronous, meaning that when a send() returns the caller is allowed to modify the buffer, which forces the network code in OSv to not be zero-copy.</li>
<li><strong>Unscalable application design: </strong>It is not easy to write an application to scale linearly in the number of cores in a multi-core machine, and many applications that work well on one or two cores, scale very badly to many cores. For example memcached keeps some global statistics (e.g., the number of requests served) and updates it under a lock – which becomes a major bottleneck when the number of cores grow. What might seem like an acceptable solution – lock-free atomic variables – is also not scalable, because while no mutex is involved, atomic operations, and the <em>cache line bounces </em>(as different CPUs read and write the same variable), both become slower as the number of cores increase. So writing a really scalable application – one which can run on (for example) 64 cores and run close to 64 times faster than it does on a single core – is a big challenge and most applications are not as scalable as they should be – which will become more and more noticeable as the number of cores per machine continues to increase.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the aforementioned OSv paper, we tried an experiment to quantify the first effect – the inefficiency of the Posix API. The subset of memcached needed for the benchmark was very simple: a request is a single packet (UDP), containing a “GET” or “PUT” command, and the result is a single UDP packet as well. So we implemented in OSv a simple “packet filter” API: every incoming ethernet packet gets processed by a function (memcached’s hash-table lookup) which immediately creates the response packet. There is no additional network stack, no locks or atomic operations (we ran this on a single CPU), no file descriptors, etc. The performance of this implementation was an impressive 4 times better than the original memcached server.</p>
<p>But while the simple “packet filter” API was useful for the trivial UDP memcached, it was not useful for implementing more complex applications, for example applications which are asynchronous (cannot generate a response immediately from one request packet), use TCP or need to use multiple cores. Fast “packet filter”-like APIs are already quite commonly used (DPDK is a popular example) and are excellent to implement routers and similar packet-processing software; But they are not really helpful if you try to write a complex, highly-asynchronous network applications of the kind that is often used on the cloud – such as a NoSQL database, HTTP server, search engine, and so on.</p>
<p>For the MIKELANGELO project, we set out to design a new API which could answer both above requirements: An API which new applications can use to achieve optimal performance (i.e., the same level of performance achieved by the “packet filtering API” implementation), while at the same time allows the creation of complex real-life applications: The result of this design is <em>Seastar</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seastar is a C++14 library, which can be used on both OSv and Linux. Because Seastar bypasses the kernel for most things, we do not expect additional speed improvements by running it on OSv – though some of OSv’s other advantages (such as image size and boot time) may still be relevant.</li>
<li>Seastar is designed for the needs of complex asynchronous server applications of the type common on the cloud – e.g., NoSQL databases, HTTP servers, etc. Here “asynchronous” means that a request usually triggers a cascade of events (disk reads, communication with other nodes, etc.) and only at a later time can the reply be composed.</li>
<li>Seastar provides the application the mechanisms it needs to solve both performance bottlenecks mentioned at the top of this section: Achieve optimal efficiency on one core, as well as scalability in the number of cores. We’ll explain how Seastar does this below.</li>
<li>Seastar can bypass the legacy kernel APIs, e.g., it can directly access the network card directly using DPDK. Seastar provides a full TCP/IP stack (which DPDK does not).</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve reimplemented memcached using Seastar, and measured 2 to 4-fold performance improvement over the original memcached as well as near-perfect scalability to 32 cores (something which the “packet filter” implementation couldn’t do). Figure below for more details.</p>

<p>Applications that want to use Seastar will need to be rewritten to use its new (and very different) APIs. This requires significant investment, but also comes with significant rewards: The creator of the Seastar library, ScyllaDB, spent the last two years reimplementing the popular Cassandra distributed database in C++ and Seastar, and the result, “Scylla” (which, like Seastar and OSv, is released as open source[<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a>]), has much higher throughput than Cassandra: Independent benchmarks[<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>] by Samsung showed Scylla to have between 10 to 37 times higher throughput than Cassandra on a cluster of 24-core machines in different workloads,&nbsp; In fact, the Scylla distributed database performs so well that it has become ScyllaDB’s main product, making the company highly dependent on Seastar’s exploitation. For this reason, ScylllaDB has been investing into Seastar additional efforts beyond what is being funded by the MIKELANGELO project, and plans to continue developing Seastar even after the project ends.</p>
<p>We use Scylla, the Seastar-based reimplementation of Cassandra, in the “Cloud Bursting” use case. But our goal is for Seastar to be a general-purpose APIs which will be useful to many kinds of asynchronous server applications, which are often run on the cloud. As such, we are making an effort of providing a rich, well-balanced, and well documented API, and also writing a tutorial on writing Seastar applications (a draft of which was already included in D4.4 and D4.5). At the time of this writing, we know of at least two other companies besides ScyllaDB which based their product on Seastar, and more are considering doing this.</p>
<h2>Seastar architecture</h2>
<p>How can an application designed to use Seastar be so much faster than one using more traditional APIs such as threads, shared memory and sockets? The short answer is that modern computer architecture has several performance traps that are easy to fall into, and Seastar ensures that you don’t by using the following architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sharded (“share nothing”) design:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Modern multi-core machines have shared memory, but using it incorrectly can drastically reduce an application’s performance: Locks are very slow, and so are processor-provided “lock-free” atomic operations and memory fences. Reading and writing the same memory object from different cores significantly slows down processing compared to one core finding the object in its cache (this phenomenon is known as “cache line bouncing”). All of these slow operations already hurt one-core performance, but get progressively slower as the number of cores increases, so it also hurts the scaling of the application to many cores.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the number of cores increases, multi-core machines inevitably become multi-socket, and we start seeing NUMA (non-uniform memory access) issues. I.e., some cores are closer to some parts of memory – and accessing the …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, ch. 7.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.</p></blockquote><p><em>Active Listening</em>:<sup><label for="sn1">†</label><span><span><sup>†</sup>
<a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/active-listening.pdf">Active Listening</a>, p. 2</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, advice and information are almost always seen as efforts to change a person and thus serve as barriers to his self-expression and the development of a creative relationship.</p></blockquote><p>You can find similar advice in most books on relationships, people management, etc.</p><p>This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want <em>results</em>, not to grouse into the void!<sup><label for="sn2">‡</label><span><span><sup>‡</sup>
Empirically, I did notice that I usually got better results from listening than from giving advice. So I inferred that this advice was true for other people, but not me, because other people didn’t actually want to fix their problems.</span></span></sup></p><p>Frequently the “just listen” advice comes with tactical tips, like “reflect what people said back to you to prove that you’re listening.” For instance, consider these example dialogues from <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>:<sup><label for="sn3">§</label><span><span><sup>§</sup>
<em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, Chapter 7, Exercise 5.5, 5.6 and solutions.</span></span></sup></p><blockquote><p>Person A: How could you say a thing like that to me?</p><p>Person B: Are you feeling hurt because you would have liked me to agree to do what you requested?</p></blockquote><p>Or:</p><blockquote><p>Person A: I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him.</p><p>Person B: So you’re feeling furious because you would like him to be around more than he is?</p></blockquote><p>I say this with great respect for <em>Nonviolent Communication</em>, but these sound like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">1970s-era chatbot</a>. If I were Person A in either of these dialogues my next line would be “yes, you dingbat—can you turn the nonviolence down a couple notches?” I’d feel alienated knowing that someone is going through their NVC checklist on me.</p><hr><p>Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners <em>do</em> often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" target="_blank">cargo cult advice</a>: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s <em>generating</em> that surface appearance.</p><p>The generator is curiosity.</p><p>When I’ve listened the most effectively to people, it’s because I was intensely curious—I was trying to build a <em>detailed, precise</em> understanding of what was going on in their head. When a friend says, “I’m furious with my husband. He’s never around when I need him,” that one sentence has a huge amount underneath. How often does she need him? What does she need him for? Why isn’t he around? Have they talked about it? If so, what did he say? If not, why not?</p><p>It turns out that <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" target="_blank">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding" target="_blank">open it up and see the gears inside</a>. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.</p><p>Some stories from recent memory:</p><ul><li><p>When we started doing a pair programming rotation at Wave, I suggested that, to make scheduling easier, we designate a default time when pairing sessions would happen. A coworker objected that this seemed authoritarian. I was extremely puzzled, but they’d previously mentioned being an anarchist, so I was tempted to just chalk it up to a political disagreement and move on. But instead I tried to get curious and explore more deeply whatever “political” models were generating that disagreement. After a lot of digging into what was or wasn’t authoritarian for them and why, it turned out the disagreement was because they’d missed the word “default” and thought I was suggesting a single <em>mandatory</em> time for pair programming.</p></li><li><p>My partner, Eve, wrote a post about Polish attitudes about sex, with some details that upset her (Polish) parents. When her parents told her that, she initially got very stressed about having to have a conversation to calm them down. I thought she shouldn’t be worried and the conversation would be fine, but of course just telling her that wasn’t very helpful. Instead, I summoned up my curiosity and asked lots of questions about her relationship with her parents, her parents’ relationship with each other, each of their relationships with Catholicism, etc. By the end of the conversation, after thinking through all the baggage involved, Eve agreed with me, and her attitude about the upcoming conversation shifted from impending doom to compassionate curiosity about where her parents were coming from.</p></li><li><p>I was stressed by work and complained to Eve about some things that I felt frustrated and stuck about. Instead of suggesting solutions, she kept asking for more details until she had more or less a complete snapshot of my mental state. At that point, she observed that every time I mentioned feeling sad, I sounded contemptuous and exasperated with myself. She hypothesized that I wasn’t giving myself permission to be sad. The “solution” to my problem ended up being to give me a big hug and let me cry on her shoulder for a bit, after which I immediately felt much less stressed.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the “helper” tried to learn about the “complainer’s” reality in as much detail as possible—not just the problem, but the whole person and whatever else was behind the immediate issue. And that’s what made it possible for them to actually help.</p><p>It often feels like I understand enough to be helpful without knowing all those details. But when I think that, I’m usually wrong: I end up giving bad advice, based on bad assumptions, and the person I’m talking to ends up having to do a bunch of work to argue with me and correct my bad assumptions. That makes the conversation feel disfluent and adversarial instead of collaborative.</p><p>It turns out this is a really common failure mode of helping-conversations, which is what I think generates the old saw at the beginning of this post, that “sometimes people don’t want help, just to be listened to.”</p><p>But I think that’s actually too nice to the helper, and uncharitable to the complainer (in that it assumes they weirdly don’t care about solving their problem). What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.</p><hr><p>When I’m curious about what someone’s saying, I often do repeat things back to them in my own words. But it’s because I’m genuinely curious, not because I’m checking off the “reflect words” box in my “be a good listener” checklist. That means I do it in a way that sounds like my natural speech, instead of mimicking them like a chatbot.</p><p>When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It’s a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say. Putting their idea into my own words shows them that I’ve fully digested it, and helps us establish a shared language in which to talk about it. That, in turn, makes the conversation fluent and collaborative, rather than a zigzag of bad assumptions and corrections.</p><p>So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can. Once you’ve done that, your advice will be more likely hit the mark, and you’ll be able to communicate it clearly.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>To start: yes, long time no see. Well, COVID-19 has been like that. Some days I
feel accomplished if I successfully check my email. I finally managed to clear
out a backlog of an entire handfull of things that needed thoughtful responses,
though, and so here I am, screaming into the void instead of at anyone in
particular.</p>
<p>That said, let's talk a bit about radios. It is probably unsurprising by now
that I have a long-running interest in radio and especially digital radio
communications---but people who come to radio from all kinds of different
perspectives run into one odd problem: the curious refusal of any receiver
to tune to certain frequencies in the 800-900MHz range.</p>
<p>A lot of people have a general knowledge that this has to do with some kind of
legal prohibition on reception of cellular phones. That's roughly correct, but
to fully explain the matter requires going into some depth on two different
topics: FCC regulation of radio devices, and the development of cellular
phones. The first sounds more boring, so let's hit that one first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, most electronic products manufactured or imported into the
United States are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications
Commission. Specifically, they generally require an "Equipment Authorization"
from the FCC prior to being marketed. For purposes of this regulatory scheme,
electronic devices can be broadly divided into two categories: intentional
radiators and unintentional radiators.</p>
<p>An intentional radiator is something that is specifically intended to broadcast
a radio signal, like, say, a cellular phone. Intentional radiators must be
certified to comply with the specific Part of the FCC regulations relevant to
the service for which they will be used. For example, cellular phones must be
certified against Part 27, Wireless Communications Service, among others. The
exact process varies by the part and can be involved, but it generally
involves the manufacturer paying a certified test lab to perform certain tests
and complying with various other filing requirements which include placing a
label on the device which specifies its FCC approval. Device manufacturers
must file with the FCC a description of how this label will appear before they
receive approval to market the device, which is why the rough designs of
unreleased devices are sometimes revealed by the rough drawings in these
filings---tech journalists will watch these to get the dimensions of new
iPhones, for example.</p>
<p>By the way, when I say the "FCC Regulations," if you want to follow along at
home these are promulgated as 47 CFR. So Part 27, for example, refers to 47 CFR
27. The ever lovely Cornell LII has the whole thing for your entertainment:
https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47. There's some reading for when you need
help falling asleep.</p>
<p>But that's all besides the point, I'm more interested in talking about
unintentional radiators, devices which are not intended to produce RF radiation
but may still do so as a result of the operation of the electronics---this is
generally called a spurious emission, which is basically any RF emitted by
accident. These devices are certified under Part 15 of the FCC regulations[1],
and so are sometimes called "Part 15 devices." Part 15 essentially limits the
type and amplitude of spurious emissions to prevent random devices causing
harmful interference due to defects in their designs.</p>
<p>What would we call a radio <em>receiver</em>, then? It is explicitly a radio device,
but is not intended to transmit anything. As a result, radio receivers are Part
15 devices. Most of Part 15 is very general and doesn't really say anything
specific about radio devices, it just limits spurious emissions and other
design standards. However, 15.121 gets a great deal more specific in
discussing "Scanning receivers.' A scanning receiver is specifically defined
earlier in the regulation as a device capable of tuning to two or more frequency
bands in the range of 30-960Mhz. This has the fun result that nothing for the
GHz range is technically a scanner, but for practical reasons this doesn't
matter too much.</p>
<p>So what's in 15.121? This is:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(a): ... scanning receivers and frequency converters designed or
marketed for use with scanning receivers, shall: (1) Be incapable of operating
(tuning), or readily being altered by the user to operate, within the frequency
bands allocated to the Cellular Radiotelephone Service in part 22 of this
chapter (cellular telephone bands). ... (b) Be designed so that the tuning,
control and filtering circuitry is inaccessible. The design must be such that
any attempts to modify the equipment to receive transmissions from the Cellular
Radiotelephone Service likely will render the receiver inoperable. </p>
<p>The rest of paragraph (a) gives a pretty long clarification of "readily being
altered by the user," and it's amusing to think of a bunch of FCC characters
sitting around a table trying to think up every alteration that is easy.
Jumper wires and reprogramming micro-controllers are both right out.</p>
<p>It gets even better:</p>
<p>47 CFR 15.121(b): ... scanning receivers shall reject any signals from the
Cellular Radiotelephone Service frequency bands that are 38 dB or lower based
upon a 12 dB SINAD measurement, which is considered the threshold where a
signal can be clearly discerned from any interference that may be present. </p>
<p>So, here's this actual weird rule about scanners. Scanners are specifically
prohibited from being able to tune to any bands allocated to the Part 22
Cellular Radiotelephone Service. This raises questions, and as you can imagine
from the way I got here, I am about to spend a long time answering them.</p>
<p>When the FCC says "Cellular Radiotelephone Service," they aren't talking about
cell phones in general. The CRS as I'll call it refers to a <em>very specific</em>
cellular service, and that is AMPS.</p>
<p>AMPS, the Advanced Mobile Phone System, is the most common in the US of the
"1G" cellular services. Most carriers that were around when it was offered
called it "Analog" service, and indeed, AMPS was entirely analog. And, due to
an odd detail of the regulation, large cellular carriers were <em>required</em> to
offer AMPS service until 2008, long after AMPS phones were no longer produced.
You may have had a candy bar phone back when you would occasionally see an "A"
for analog service, but I hope not into the late 2000s.</p>
<p>There are a few things that we might infer from AMPS being an analog service.
One of those things is that it probably did not employ strong encryption. In
fact, AMPS employed no scrambling or enciphering of any kind. Your phone
conversations were just flapping in the wind for anyone to hear. This posed a
major practical problem for carriers in the '90s as it was discovered that it
was not particularly difficult to intercept the call setup process from an AMPS
phone and swipe its identification numbers, allowing you to basically steal
someone else's cellular service. You can imagine that this was popular with
certain criminals with a need for untraceable but convenient communications.</p>
<p>There was also a problem for consumers: their phone conversations could be
fairly easily overheard. There were a number of ways to do this, using any
radio scanner that covered that band for example. One particularly well-known
option was a particular model of phone, the Oki 900, that had an unusually
open design (in terms of modifiability) that led to reverse engineered and
modified firmware being developed that made eavesdropping on other people's
calls just, well, a feature it had.</p>
<p>The scale of this problem was fairly large, and it was fairly well known. For
example, let's turn to <em>my</em> favorite source of late-night reading, newspaper
archives. A lovely piece in the 30 May 1990 issue of The News and Observer,
from Raleigh NC, takes the cheesy headline "Monitoring Megahertz" and goes
into some depth on the issue.</p>
<p>"I've heard men call their wives and tell them they'll be home late, then call
their girl friends," quipped one electronics store owner who had "accidentally"
eavesdropped on cellular calls using a scanner. We've all fat-fingered our
ways into someone else's affairs I'm sure, pun intended. Another person said
"when you look at the fact that there are how many thousands of people out
there who know my name, my mailing address and my salary...I put cellular
eavesdropping down as being no different from that." In the face of technology,
even in 1990, people had begun to abandon their privacy.</p>
<p>Cellular carriers were not so happy about this, viewing it as an embarrassment
to their operation. I have heard before that cellular carriers went so far as
to lobby for banning scanners entirely, although I am not aware of much hard
evidence of this. What they did do was convince congress to stick an extra few
paragraphs onto an otherwise only tangentially related bit of legislation
called the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act of 1992. This has
largely to do with abusive 1-900 numbers, which is its whole own topic in
telephone regulation that I ought to take on sometime. But it also brought
along just a bit more, an extra section that was subsequently amended several
times at the behest of cellular carriers. Let's read part of it, as amended,
and with some editing for readability.</p>
<p>The Commission shall prescribe and make effective regulations denying equipment
authorization for any scanning receiver that is capable of---(A) receiving
transmissions in the frequencies allocated to the domestic cellular radio
telecommunications service, (B) readily being altered by the user to receive
transmissions in such frequencies, or (C) being equipped with decoders that
convert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.</p>
<p>Well, we've made it full circle: we've seen the regulation, and we've seen the
legislation that kicked the FCC to write the regulation. But how does this
translate today? Things get a bit weird there.</p>
<p>You see, the FCC seems to have (sensibly) …</p></article></div>
