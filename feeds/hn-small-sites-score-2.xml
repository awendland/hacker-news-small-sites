        <p><a href="https://taipei.youbike.com.tw/home">YouBike</a> (or Ubike) is my first choice of transportation when it comes to moving around the city of Taipei. I largely prefer it over taking the subway, bus, or taxi. It is affordable, well maintained, comfortable, at waking distance reach from anywhere, and the cities have built great biking paths in the major cities.</p>
<p>The number of YouBike rides keeps increasing steadily since it was launched in 2012. There were 170 million rides since it was introduced in 2012, and <a href="https://taipei.youbike.com.tw/news/content?5ee1e4b61b994541c0690826">last month it reached  ~3 million rides</a> in Taipei:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/ubike/youbike-monthly-rental.jpg" alt="Youbike usage statistics"></p>
<h2 id="a-high-quality-infrastructure">A high-quality infrastructure</h2>
<p>YouBikes are <a href="https://taipei.youbike.com.tw/station/map">everywhere</a> in Taipei and New Taipei City. As for October 2020, over <a href="https://gist.github.com/erickhun/f0d3e8f3c3c4f70dc521c2abb43bb8a0">42000 YouBikes are deployed</a>, with over 1000 stations. Stations <a href="https://taipei.youbike.com.tw/news/list?5cb582c1060db454916c643c">get added every few weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Since the first time I arrive in Taipei (2016), I am pleasantly surprised that I rarely got a broken bike. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Bicycles">Giant</a> is actually the (local) company that provides them. The bikes feel durable, lightweight, and really well maintained. Each bike is bought by the city for around <a href="https://disp.cc/b/163-6PkZ">9200 TWD (~USD 300)</a>, and comes with a 7 years maintenance.</p>
<p>To make it really convenient, the city has organized each station  <a href="https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A11F01CFC9F58C83&amp;s=5888478293ADD1A8">from 200 to 600 meters</a> from each other. What makes you within 5 to 10 minutes walk from wherever you are in the city.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F5HWa3v.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="data-driven-decisions">Data-driven decisions</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed that the stations are also rarely empty. From time to time, I’ve spotted some employees “reloading” or “deloading” stations that are full or empty. Who are they? Where do they take those bikes? I’ve discussed with <a href="https://twitter.com/TaipeiUrbanism">Alex Garcia</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timcho-giser">Tim Cho</a>, two urbanism specialists of the city of Taipei.</p>
<p>1 or 2 employees are responsible for a given area to “unload” or “refill” the stations. But how do they decide if some station should be “refilled” or not? Is a single empty station enough to make an employee move to the station? Not necessarily. Most of the time, an area of few stations being almost empty will make it worthwhile to move. This is a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">cluster analysis</a>”. Alex mentioned me they also have “re-balancing” trucks equipped with an application with a smart algorithm telling them where which full stations to unload, and which empty ones need a refill.</p>
<p>To make their work easier, historical data are used to predict the flow-in &amp; flow out for each station. They know the patterns on which stations will be empty and which one will need a refill. Those stations often have a “buffer” of bikes nearby locked together in bulk. When the station is about to get empty, the employee responsible for this area will drive there and refill the empty station with the buffer of bikes already present.</p>
<p>To make the decisions to add new stations, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timcho-giser">Tim</a> explained they use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS spatial analysis</a>,  to realize uncovered area (population density, schools, presence of metro station, POIs, etc…) to make the decision to add or not a new YouBike station.</p>
<h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3>
<p>Taipei City (and <a href="https://data.gov.tw/">Taiwan in general</a>) makes an amazing job at <a href="https://data.taipei/">opening their data</a>. It provides <a href="https://tcgbusfs.blob.core.windows.net/blobyoubike/YouBikeTP.json">real time data</a> showing each Youbike station status. Any developer can offer their own application to help users to find bikes availability or making the service more useful. This open data is how <a href="https://gist.github.com/erickhun/f0d3e8f3c3c4f70dc521c2abb43bb8a0">I’ve calculated the number</a> of YouBikes in Taipei.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jakubsvehla/status/1311345837952434176">Jakub told me</a> he used this open data to help him stop being late at class. He depended on the YouBike to go to NTUST but ended up always late because his nearest station was empty. He started recording the patterns/waves of bikes coming and leaving the stations to know the time to go to the station.</p>
<p><a href="http://bdon.org/about/">Brandon</a> created this really <a href="http://bdon.org/youbike-forecast/">interesting visual map</a> showing detailed usage of each station with cool animations. If you live in Taiwan, click on your station, and you’ll see when bikes are more likely to be available!</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/ubike/youbike-realtime.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Google recently took advantage of it and made a really nice implementation when users are looking for directions in Google Maps. The app will <a href="https://twitter.com/eric_khun/status/1291567323510317057">show you nearest departure/arrival Youbike station</a> and its availability:</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/ubike/GoogleMaps-Youbike.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="an-universal-and-simple-payment-system">An universal and simple payment system</h2>
<p>One of my favorite this about Taiwan is probably the EasyCard payment system. With a single card, you can use it in the metro, convenient store, supermarkets, and YouBike. Probably the best thing is that you can use that card everywhere in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Banks with their debit/credit cards and phones (via NFC?) have the Easycard payment system integrated. All those following card/debit cards integrate the EasyCard payment chip. Any convenient store will sell you one of those cards, without any requirements.</p>
<p><img src="https://erickhun.com/img/ubike/easy_cards-back-front.jpg" alt="Easy Card solution integrated into every card payment"></p>
<p>A single chip to rule them all.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-pricing">The right pricing</h2>
<p>The Youbike rental system is a pay as you go model. It <a href="https://taipei.youbike.com.tw/use/rates?5cc2971d083e7b55e32b8172">costs</a>  <strong>5 NTD (usd0,17) the first 30 minutes</strong>, then 10NTD (usd0.35) per 30 minute. The city also encourages the usage of YoubBke by taking 5NTD on the first 30 minutes on them. To compare the rate with other cities in the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lyon (France) (<a href="https://velov.grandlyon.com/en/offers/groups/list#190">1usd/ 45 minute</a> per rental)</li>
<li>Paris is 1EUR / 30 minute (~ usd1,20)</li>
<li>Germany has a <a href="https://www.callabike.de/en">3euros per 30 minutes</a> rate (~ usd3,50)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impressive-dedicated-bike-paths-infrastructure">Impressive dedicated bike paths infrastructure</h2>
<p>Taiwan is famously known for being a paradise for Bike lovers, from the urban city bikers the <a href="https://youtu.be/Sxfd2xzlM6k">most courageous professional bikers</a>. Did you know that Taiwan had more than 4500km of dedicated bike path? The longest one measuring <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/taiwan-cycle-tour/index.html">968km long</a>. Taipei alone has 500+ km of dedicated biking path. The city has spent a lot of effort into building a large and safe bike path. It is really pleasant to move around the city:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5sv48SJ.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The riverside bike-path is <a href="https://www.travel.taipei/en/must-visit/riverside-bikeway">more than 100 kilometers</a> long! And they <a href="https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A11F01CFC9F58C83&amp;sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&amp;s=C8487022F5E63064">are planning to extends those biking paths</a> to expand bicycle trails in the city soon.</p>
<h2 id="an-unified-bike-sharing-system-in-all-cities">An unified bike-sharing system in all cities</h2>
<p>Another great thing is that all the biggest cities in Taiwan (Taichung, New Tapei City, Kaoshuing) have YouBike. No matter <a href="https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/265/economics/are-monopolies-always-bad/">great or bad</a>, it makes the discovery of a new city frictionless. You don’t have to subscribe to other services and worry about getting back a deposit.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Taipei has made a great job of implementing an amazing infrastructure bike-sharing infrastructure. With open data, the incentive to use bikes, maintaining a low price, and keeping bikes in great shape. The steady increases in the number of rides in Taipei talks by itself, while <a href="https://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Operations/V%C3%A9lib_%202.0-Case.htm">other countries see their usage decreasing</a> over years. They’re today transitioning to a second generation of <a href="https://english.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=A11F01CFC9F58C83&amp;s=5888478293ADD1A8">Youbike 2.0</a>, better, lighter, and with docks taking less space.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrapper"><div id="container"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When a tech company needs a skilled developer to work on a complex task, they naturally tend to look for somebody who has done the same thing before. Sound and obvious logic. It was applied long before the tech sector even emerged. If you were to hire, say, an auto mechanic, you’d do something similar. However, tech recruiting is unique in one peculiar factor: the level of specificity in job ads and screening interviews is insane.</p><h3 id="job-ads">Job ads</h3><p>For the sake of the experiment, I searched for auto mechanic jobs around London. In the vast majority of job ads, I found <strong>a single sentence</strong> describing prerequisites for a job. Something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Only vehicle technicians/mechanics with appropriate hands-on experience and qualifications in the motor industry should apply.</p></blockquote><p>No “experience in rebuilding the carburetor” requirement. None of “repaired 2018 Toyota Corollas for the last 7 years” nonsense. An ad describes a type of job the repair shop performs and then lets the applicant decide whether they have “appropriate hands-on experience”. Some ads might ask for total years of job experience, even then often adding a “preferred” remark.</p><p>Compare it with a <em>typical</em> job description for a senior developer (not a real one, since I don’t want to pick on any company in particular):</p><blockquote><ul><li>X+ years of full-time software development experience</li><li>Knowledge of software development fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, etc.)</li><li>Comprehensive knowledge of modern Javascript (ES6+: Modules, classes, arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc.)</li><li>Ability to select the right tools/libraries for the job</li><li>X+ years of experience with VueJS</li><li>X+ years of experience with PostgreSQL</li><li>Solid understanding of good practices, design patterns, and writing idiomatic Javascript code</li><li>Accounting for performance implications and scalability of code</li><li>Desire to write meaningful tests and maintaining thorough test coverage</li><li>Ability to maintain large, complex codebases</li></ul></blockquote><p>Phew. If I wouldn’t know how those ads are made, I would think somebody gets paid per character here. Half of the bullet points are useless: knowing best practices, maintaining test coverage, and the ability to work on large codebases are be covered by “senior” in the title. Other requirements are restrictively specific. Would a senior software engineer with React experience be puzzled by the Vue codebase? Not for more than an hour. Sure, they might some personal preferences in that regard, but to address those there’s another section like “About Us” or “What we want from you”.</p><p>There are very few quantitative metrics in the developer’s profile, so companies just can’t avoid putting “years of experience” everywhere. It’s a simple boolean criterion that can be applied without thought. I find it is on average a quite poor predictor of the applicant’s performance for <em>your</em> environment and tasks. It’s a value to be considered, but it has much too little signal to apply it on its own, as a filter.</p><p>In a particular case when you don’t want to “train” fresh-grads, you <em>could</em> put “1+ years full-time employment as…” requirement, but you could also just ask for “experience writing code for production systems” without setting an imaginary cutoff date. Experience is non-linear, and to compress into one number you need to leave out so many details that the result doesn’t carry much weight.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/xkcd_1293.png" alt="XKCD comic #1293: Job Interview">
<small>Who needs unsplash where there's <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">XKCD</a>
on every topic?</small></p><h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3><p>Moving on to the interview, the same two extremes are often seen.</p><p>On one side are silly logical puzzles. Is there a correlation between the ability to estimate the number of piano tuners in NYC and the programmer’s performance? I don’t know. I doubt anyone knows for sure. Even empirically it seems like a stretch. Google, commonly known as a trend-setter for these types of interviews, stopped using logical puzzles precisely because they didn’t found any evidence of them being effective. Those questions are supposed to test <em>generic</em> critical thinking and, even if they do, that doesn’t necessarily translate to the specific types of problem-solving software developers engage in.</p><p>On the other extreme, a list of questions about precisely the tools the company is using. Just like an exam. But exams exist to test student’s <strong>knowledge</strong> on a particular topic, not to evaluate his <strong>experience</strong> in a field as vast as software development. The end result is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">overfitting</a>
in machine learning, where the model represents training data a little too well, losing an ability to generalize and predict new data points. Filling the company with candidates that all have the exact same skillset and background means they will come up with similar solutions and make identical mistakes. Instead of building a synergetic team, it creates a hive-mind.</p><p>The importance of experience in a narrowly specialized field (on a level of particular libraries, frameworks, even languages) is overrated. When a developer joins a new project, there will be a warm-up period when they get used to the internal conventions, product and business specifics, and learn to work with existing codebase (often poorly documented). The overhead of learning a well-documented, state-of-the-art open-source library or framework is a drop in an ocean.</p><h3 id="but-can-we-do-better">But can we do better?</h3><p>The most productive technical interview is a two-way experience exchange. The interviewee gets to learn about the challenges that the company faces and an interviewer gets to assess the candidate based on his strong sides. Whether you give a candidate a whiteboard task, coding challenge, or simply ask them a question, an answer is not supposed to be a means to an end, but rather a topic for conversation. Subjective and open-ended questions which are rooted in a subject area, but are not tied-in to a particular tool, give the interviewer much more insight into the developer’s experience than “how would you join these three tables?”. If it turns out this particular candidate is not a match, at least both sides have likely learned something new. Less time wasted.</p><p>Another important benefit of the conversational interviewing style is that it creates a much more comfortable psychological environment for the candidate by adjusting the power dynamic. Nobody likes being assessed. If an interviewer sets himself as an equal, instead of getting into a „boss“ persona, the whole meeting will be less stressful. The candidate is more likely to behave naturally and that’s how you want to see them because that’s how they will behave on a job. Unless developers in your company are constantly stressed, in which case you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>This interview style will probably never become very popular in large enterprises. It’s too un-formalized, doesn’t scale well, and relies entirely too much on the interviewer‘s professionalism. Yet, there are lots of startups with a strong company culture that care enough about tech hiring to re-think the process.</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>No-code development platforms are software that allows non-programmers or users to build applications using a GUI or visual flow. No-code development platforms work with a WYSIWYG editor, allowing users to quickly connect elements, components, and styles together.</p>
<div><p>For example, <b>Webflow</b>, a no-code development platform for building websites allows users to select functional components and arrange blocks of elements in visual flow. A website can then be built block by block, element by element, with the designer adding and removing components as he/she deems fit, circumventing the necessity to learn HTML or CSS.</p><p>The no-code platform solution is directed mainly at non-programmers and business managers, allowing them to build business solutions that are efficient, scalable, and cost-efficient on the fly. No-code is a revolutionary innovation to the traditional way of building apps. It takes away the middleman (the developer), who stands in-between the app and the management. It takes away months of planning, countless interactions between management and the developer to get the product right, and removes extensive testing by <em>quality assurance engineers</em>.</p></div>

<h2>Why are No-code platforms popular?</h2>
<p>The hype around no-code development gets bigger by the day. In fact, according to <em>Github CEO, Chris Wanstrath</em></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of coding is no coding at all.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div><p>When COVID happened and people had to work from home, it exposed the demand and supply gap of <a href="https://codecoda.com/en/microsoft-enterprise-solutions">business solutions</a> – the fast-rising number of digitized solutions needed were undermined by the limited number of skilled developers available to create those solutions. Many solutions to track and minimize the effects of COVID itself had to be built quickly, including the New York engagement portal, which was built on <b>Unqork</b>, a no-code platform. The rising demand for software could not be met by programmers, who were limited by their numbers, skill, and time and so people resorted to other ways to create software.</p><p>Not only did the pandemic create a surge in the use of no-code platforms, tech giants like Microsoft and Google with their respective <em>PowerApp</em> and <em>GoogleApp Maker</em> continue to push these solutions as the perfect way to bridge the <em>business-to-programmer gap</em>.</p></div>
<h2>Is No-code a novel idea?</h2>
<div><p>Absolutely not. In 1997, Macromedia created Dreamweaver, a no-code platform for creating websites. Visual Basic and Access (launched in 1992) generated user interfaces automatically from a database. WordPress, which is a content management system and low-code platform has been around since 2003.</p><p>
It is remarkable to note that no-code software has been around for more than two decades, yet they did not take-over coding. Instead, they come and go, or work alongside traditional coding.</p></div>
<h2>Is No-code the future of software development? Will it eradicate traditional coding?</h2>
<p>As No-code software continues to grow, there are concerns by IT specialists if it makes sense to leave the business of building applications to non-programmers. There are also concerns if these platforms mean the end to professional coding as we know it, and replace developers.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a former software engineer, so I used to have the same fear. Just because coding has been automated doesn’t mean the entire skill is gone. In fact, it may even be more valued now. Every business will have something unique that can’t be addressed by a no-code solution. You still need developers for the exceptions that these visual tools don’t support.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<h3>No-code won’t be replacing traditional coding soon, and here’s why.</h3>
<div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Limited options</h4><p>No-code solutions are only suitable for businesses that offer simple solutions. Everything fits only if it is within the setup of the no-code software vendor. No-code solutions do not offer the same precision and inclusiveness that traditional coding does.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it’s a higher level of abstraction, it will be limiting in some ways. You won’t have the same flexibility as code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Co-Founder, Bubble</p>
</div>
<div><p>The no-code platform provides templates that can be tweaked by the user to fit his own creativity. Sadly, they can’t cover every single specific feature needed by a business.&nbsp; It limits the options available to the user because he has to make do with the components available or seek additional help, which will require more money.</p><p>Traditional coding considers all the complexities of a business – <em>security</em>, <em>database</em>, and <em>features</em>. Businesses that are big and complicated cannot be built with no-code platforms as they would be confined to the model, customizations, and themes of the vendor.</p><p>It is also important to note that business solutions to be built on no-code platforms must be very specific and strict with their requirements. Proper research on the different no-code vendors should also be carried out. This is to streamline the requirement a business needs with what a vendor offers as not all vendors offer the same features.</p></div>

</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Vendor lock-in</h4><div><p>Vendor lock-in is the most prevalent fear of using no-code platforms. Having an app tied to a specific vendor means having to work within only limits, integrations, and provisions made by the vendor.
Cross-compatibility is not a thing yet amongst no-code vendors. Migrating from one vendor platform to another can be daunting or almost impossible. If you are using a particular vendor and it lacks a particular feature you need, integrating that specific feature from another vendor is unlikely. You would have to redo the application in that other vendor.</p><p>To keep a user on their platform, some no-code vendors do not generate source code, others generate convoluted source code that is almost impossible to edit or maintain outside their platform, making you stuck with them.</p><p>This is in direct contrast to traditional coding where code is written for maintainability and portability, making it a preferred choice for many.</p></div>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="400"><div><h4>No-code software is not built on no-code platforms</h4><div><p>Ironically, no-code platforms are not built on no-code platforms. Their software is built by professional developers who carefully use software methodologies and actual code to create a software that others can build on. These developers are also needed to maintain, upgrade, and scale the no-code software as needed.</p><p>No-code solutions have an extensive reach as they run on cloud technologies and must cater to users building applications on an application. A no-code platform cannot handle another no-code platform. These platforms cannot kill coding because they need software engineers to build and maintain them.</p></div>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Security and database concerns</h4><div><p>No-code platforms do not come with their own database management module. This must be integrated by a third-party app which may be poorly integrated making it difficult to save or access structured data. It also leaves data open to many sources and out of a business’s control.</p><p>These vendors do not force the designer to think of security or observe security practices. Most of the no-code vendors are secured on their end but leaving the application development to a non-expert may create breaches within the system.</p><p>The business does not have 100% control of its application, its source code, or the internal models of the vendor. What also happens if a vendor is liquidated, acquired or they suffer some internal breach? What is the state of the business then?</p><p>Because of this, some businesses are more comfortable with traditional coding that gives them 100% access and privacy to their own codebase and datasets. And if they were to have issues, they can easily replicate their code.</p></div>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Technical knowledge</h4><div><p>No-coding platforms may have been developed with non-technical persons and non-programmers in mind, but someone with zero knowledge of how applications work cannot use these platforms. Trying to develop an app with any no-code vendor requires some technical knowledge of how either mobile or web app works (these are the two major applications built on no-coding platforms). Zero-knowledge users will create an application/interface that is a messy, convoluted, and frustrating experience to users.</p><p>The user also needs to have knowledge of how a particular vendor works and how the different components can be put together to create a complete application. Although, learning this takes a much shorter time (even in hours) than learning how to code.</p></div>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="400"><div><h4>Cost</h4><p>One of the biggest hypes around no-code is cost-efficiency. But these platforms are quite expensive if not more expensive than traditional coding. They shroud their cost behind different plans - free (highly limited) plans, premium plans, plans for teams, plans for agencies, plans with additional benefits, and so on, making the user pay more to have the best service. Some third-party integrations also do not come cheap, adding more cost to the user.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>The no-code platform has many advantages for small and simple business solutions, but it also packs many disadvantages that greatly limit its potentials, despite its good intentions. By dodging developers to create software, we will be creating a gap in the system, that will need another software or innovation to fill.</p><p>Developers can never be truly removed from software development. It takes more than writing code to make a good programmer – the logic, the process, and the skills are things no-code platforms cannot replicate. No-code cannot replace the expertise of software developers and coding. That will be its own undoing.</p><p>Many tech CEOs are also in support of no-coding platforms. It is their vision to make tech opportunities available for everyone and at every level.</p></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to rethink training for jobs. With technology changing rapidly and new job areas emerging and transforming constantly, we need to focus on making lightweight, continuous education widely available.</p>

And since COVID-19, it's gotten worse.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Last year, Canada announced it was working on a ban of single-use plastics, which was initally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/single-use-plastics-covid-1.5683617">sidelined by the pandemic</a>. Recently, the government announced that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/single-use-plastics-1.5753327">many single-use plastics will be banned</a> by the end of 2021. At the same time, <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/single-use-plastics-covid-1.5683617">CBC News reports</a> our single-use plastic use increased by 250 to 300 per cent as people tossed their personal protective equipment and stopped using reusable bags and containers over fears they would spread the virus.</p>  <p>What makes our lives convenient is also burying us. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><strong><em>Plastic Wars</em></strong></a>, presented by <em>The Passionate Eye</em>, looks at the mounting crisis and how the industry has spent millions promoting recycling — just to sell more plastic.</p>  <h2>Less than 10% of the plastics we've used have been recycled</h2>  <p>Although activists sounded the alarm about plastic waste in the 1970s, the documentary claims from 1990 to 2010, plastic production more than doubled. We've been sorting our trash for decades, believing it would be recycled. But the truth is the vast majority of the plastic we use won't be. Over the last seven decades, <a href="https://www.oecd.org/environment/waste/policy-highlights-improving-plastics-management.pdf">less than 10 per cent of plastic waste has been recycled</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>That's because, says David Allaway, from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, the conversation has been almost exclusively about recycling and not reducing and reusing.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Plastic Wars: Recycling"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1002/935/PlasticWars_Recycling_2500kbps_620x350_1755680835594.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Even as the plastic crisis worsens, the demand for plastic grows and plastic production is rapidly expanding. One issue? Only focusing on recycling, and not reducing the amount of plastic that we use.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:06</span></span></span></p>  <h2>Recycling logo was used as a green marketing tool, says industry expert</h2>  <p>In the '80s, the industry was at the centre of an environmental backlash. Fearing an outright ban on plastics, manufacturers looked for ways to get ahead of the problem. They looked at recycling as a way to improve the image of their product and started labeling plastics with the now ubiquitous chasing-arrows symbol with a number inside.&nbsp;</p>  <p>According to Ronald Liesemer, an industry veteran who was tasked with overseeing the new initiative, "Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Most consumers might have assumed the symbol meant the product was recyclable. But according to experts in the film, there was no economically viable way to recycle most plastics, and they have ultimately ended up in a landfill. This included plastic films, bags and the wrapping around packaged goods, as well as containers like margarine tubs.<br> "Our own customers … they would flat out say, 'It says it's recyclable right on it,'" says Coy Smith, former board member of the National Recycling Coalition. "And I'd be like, 'I can tell you, I can't give this away. There's no one that would even take it if I paid them to take it.'" He believes manufacturers used the symbol as a green marketing tool.</p>  <p>"If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they're not going to be as concerned about the environment," says Larry Thomas, another top industry official interviewed in <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a>.</p>  <p>According to Lewis Freeman, a former vice-president with the Society of the Plastics Industry, many in the industry had doubts about recycling from the start. "There was never an enthusiastic belief that recycling was ultimately going to work in a significant way," he says.</p>  <p>Yet the plastic industry spent millions on ads selling plastics and recycling to consumers.</p>  <h2>Lots of our plastic was shipped to China, then Southeast Asia, for 'recycling'</h2>  <p>To solve the plastic waste problem, many recyclers started selling their product to China in the 1990s. According to recycling broker Sunil Bagaria, China took waste that North American recyclers couldn't use. "As long as it remotely resembled plastic, they wanted it," he says.</p>  <p>But they used the good stuff and disposed of the rest. And because of a growing plastic waste problem in that country, China finally stopped taking most imported plastic waste in 2018.</p>  <p>"We never asked the question, 'Are they doing it the right way? Are we damaging the environment more in the name of recycling?'" says Bagaria.</p>  <p>Now, Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia have picked up the plastic waste market. And although some North American plastics recyclers are following up to ensure their products are in fact being recycled, plastic waste is now a growing problem there, too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a>, local activist Yuyan Ismawati visits a rural community where locals scour through a huge field of plastic waste for items of value and burn the rest. This creates health problems for the residents in addition to destroying the surrounding environment. "We are struggling to clean up the modern debris and modern litter in Indonesia, the additional burden of waste from overseas — I don't know how we are going to handle it," says Ismawati. "Americans need to know that your waste ended up here."</p>  <h2>Production of plastics expected to triple by 2050</h2>  <p>In 2020, roughly 60 years after concerns about plastic waste were first raised, the focus is still on the consumer to recycle, says Allaway, and not on the environmental impact of the product and overproduction by the industry.</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Plastic Wars: Full Impact"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1004/887/PlasticWars_FullImpact_2500kbps_620x350_1755684419745.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Consumers are constantly told that they should do their part to reduce plastic waste, but in reality, consumers have the lowest amount of leverage in reducing waste - it's plastic producers that should be reporting their full environmental impacts.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:56</span></span></span></p>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a> the problem is only going to get worse. By 2050, it's estimated the global production of plastic will triple. As the oil and gas industry — which provides the source materials for plastics — &nbsp;faces a future of declining demand for fuel, it has turned to other markets.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The stakes are high, says Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA. "This is their lifeline," she says. "They are going to double down on single-use plastic like we have never seen. So we're heading towards a real battle.... This is the big war."&nbsp;</p>  <p>Watch <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/episodes/plastic-wars"><em><strong>Plastic Wars</strong></em></a> on <em>The Passionate Eye</em>.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

	<p>This month I built and launched a website called <a href="https://earlyname.com/" target="_blank">Earlyname</a>, which lets you claim your original “OG” username on new apps, games and websites (for example <span>@ben</span>, <span>@mike</span> or <span>@mia</span>). This is the story of how it went.</p>
	
	<h2>The Idea</h2>

	<p>Hello, and welcome back to another edition of man tries strange business ideas on the internet. I’m your host: Tiny Projects.</p>

	<p>How are you all doing? I’m doing just dandy, thanks for asking. I actually went on a nice holiday to Crete, where, lying on a beach, slightly sunburnt and eating a budget salami sandwich I’d whipped up in the morning, I had the idea for my next Tiny Project.</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/b88844515b8bde7a09ad7579d6c70120.png">

	<p>In the weeks leading up to this moment I’d been frantically searching for my next thing to build. This time, I thought; <em>this time</em>, things were going to be different.

	</p><p>I was going to go out in search of a problem, then build the solution! That’s the advice every Indie Hacker gives, right?</p>

	<p>My god, I tried to do this. I posted in subreddits, facebook groups and sent off a few emails, all looking for people with problems to solve. I even read half a book called “Zero to Sold”, which was about a man who made a lot of money selling software to troubled english teachers (Sorry Arvid, I’ll finish it one day).</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/346852e22bafa82fc7fa697cad8910e0.png">

	<p>My subreddit questions got <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/i89omm/online_store_owners_who_sell_physical_products/" target="_blank">loads</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/i8deri/what_qualifications_and_training_are_required_for/" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/i8deri/what_qualifications_and_training_are_required_for/" target="_blank">replies</a>, I focused on areas I knew, but I just wasn’t feeling anything. Perhaps that’s just the truth? Maybe the most profitable businesses aren’t initially that exciting.</p>

	<p>Back on the beach I’d finished my sandwich, and was just about to try a Greek delicacy: Pizza flavoured Cheetos. You just simply can’t get this stuff back in the UK.</p>

	<p><b>*Ping*</b></p>

	<p>On my phone I received an email from someone called An asking if they could change their username to <span>@an</span> on <a href="https://snormal.com/" target="_blank">Snormal</a>, the tiny social network I’d built the <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/snormal" target="_blank">month prior.</a></p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/7f24e0106465155c99ce8fb4a49be583.png">

	<p>It was a reasonable ask, and I was more than happy to oblige. However, my attention had been diverted away from my strange pizza-flavoured snack, and was heading straight towards the bright lights of username city.</p>
	 
	<p>I realised, when I first showed my girlfriend that same social network I'd made, she signed up and commented how excited she was to get her first name <span>@alice</span> as a username. The day before An’s email, I had signed up to Amazon’s upcoming MMO “New World”, and was pretty stoked I managed to get my last name <span>@stokes</span> as a username.</p>

	<p>I also realised that I’m always trying new stuff online, no matter how bad it is, just so I can snag <span>@ben</span> as a username. And wait, wasn’t that whole massive celebrity Twitter hack over the summer to do with usernames too?</p>

	<p>Gosh darn, yes it was.</p>

	<p>Well, at this point, you can probably see what I was thinking: usernames, usernames, handles, usernames. All sane thoughts about "product-market fit" and "finding a problem" went straight out of the proverbial window. In the words of Love Island: my head had been turned; turned straight to usernames. I had my next idea:</p>

	<p><b>A website that shows you new products where you can claim your perfect username.</b></p>

	<p>Even if it failed, it seemed like quite a cool project. I like usernames, I like trying new products. What’s there to lose?</p>
	
	<h2>Well, I guess there's only one way to find out.</h2>

	<p>I got back to England and two things crossed my mind:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>How am I going to start building this username thingy?</li>
		<li>Was England always this cold?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What I wanted to build was a website where I could enter the username that I wanted (ideally one that was rare, e.g. <span>@ben</span>) and my email, then each month I’d get sent a list of new things where I could get the username <span>@ben</span>.</p>

	<p>Here, I even wrote it down in a fancy Moleskine notebook to make it official:</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/aa200ff8753eba4c7f155a6724c04114.png">

	<p>If you couldn't read my lefty chicken-scratch markings:</p>

	<p><i>“Earlyname is a website where users can subscribe via email to receive a monthly summary of upcoming, exciting apps, games and websites. The caveat is that these websites allow users to have unique handles. Short original usernames and handles can prove to be valuable if a platform becomes popular, with short handles like @ben @red @dragon selling for lots. There is also prestige in holding these valuable original names - they look cool, and it shows that you are a forward thinking early-adopter.”</i></p>

	<p><i>“Users would receive a monthly email with several hand-selected platforms where usernames can be acquired, and if they are available.”</i></p>

	<p>I could also see two ways of making money out of this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Users pay a monthly subscription to receive an email each month with a list of new products where their username is available.</li>
		<li>Businesses pay to feature on my list of products sent out to users, and in return acquire a load of early adopters.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Whether or not people would actually pay for these things, I did not know.</p>

	<p>Oh, and <a href="https://earlyname.com/" target="_blank">earlyname.com</a> was conveniently available for the princely sum of £10, so I bought the domain name and christened this invention “Earlyname”. <b>Pro tip:</b> always buy your domain name before building.</p>

	<h2>Okay, lets build this thing</h2>

	<p>Looking back at how you coded something is always a bit of a blur. At the time it always feels super interesting, but then you finish and realise it was actually very boring, sort of like telling someone about a dream you had. I’ll give you an overview anyway.</p>

	<p>In total it took about 3 weeks of work alongside my regular job to build Earlyname. I set out to tick off these 5 items in order to have a working MVP:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Build a website.</li>
		<li>Find some products where you could claim usernames.</li>
		<li>Automate some way to check if a username was available.</li>
		<li>Send email lists to people.</li>
		<li>Implement paid subscriptions.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/1ddfb056637b24788a8a207467885c09.png">

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/d69e4f8935471a0040fe97d57b662855.jpg">

	<p>I tip tapped my little fingers on my light up chroma keyboard for a few weeks and, huzzah, the Earlyname website was complete.</p>

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cvGyamc.gif">

	<p>Along with implementing code for paid subscriptions, I wrote some pretty cool stuff using Puppeteer to automate checking if usernames were available on different websites. Firebase was once again my friend for hosting and storing user info, and SendGrid handled all my emails.</p>

	<p>So I now have a website where users can:
	
	</p><ul>
		<li>Enter the username they want.</li>
		<li>Enter their email address.</li>
		<li>Pay me money every month to send them a list of products where their username is available.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>My initial “new products” were Amazon New World, Makerlog, Reach.at - and of course, my very own Snormal. All of these were websites where you could make an account with a username.</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/401189dcf2c5c9a169bb47eef9efa358.png">

	<p>Well, things are looking alright aren’t they, I’ve gone from eating a sandwich on a beach to having an actual product. Now I guess I just need to put it live and start raking in some cash, cash, dollar, dollar.</p>

	<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/gauzBevJxeJHy/giphy.gif">
	
	<h2>But wait, you need some users first.</h2>

	<p>Ah yes, good point.</p>

	<p>I had a plan.</p>

	<p>I wanted to test if people were willing to pay each month to see if their username was available on new, exciting products. If they did, how much exactly would they pay?</p>

	<p>Once that was figured out, I’d stick Earlyname up on Product Hunt for an official launch.</p>
	
	<h2>So how much would people pay?</h2>
	
	<p>I had no idea. I thought somewhere in the range of Netflix Subscription price territory of $1 - $8.</p>

	<p>I decided to try a price point of $8/month first.</p>

	<p>Another problem I had was that I was slightly clueless as to who my end-user was.. People who like.. Usernames? It wasn’t exactly clear.</p>

	<p>No worries though, I had a good friend who’d help me figure out exactly who would like Earlyname the best:</p>

	<h2>Facebook ads.</h2>

	<p>It’s the ultimate lazy-man’s marketing. Just throw your product to the ad algorithm and Facebook will slowly figure out who exactly your perfect customer is.</p>

	<p>I crafted a video advert and set it live. My budget was set at £20/day so things couldn’t get too wild. All that was left to do now was sit tight and wait.</p>

	<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QkBjELn.gif">
	</p>

	<p>So, I went about my week as normal, peeking at the ad statistics in between doing proper work for my regular job.</p>

	<p>One day passed, two.. three. Nothing. People had initiated the checkout, but no one had actually completed that $8 sale to subscribe to my email. It gave me hope that people were at least interested. Perhaps my price was too high?</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/04a260b88878609d462458a1b5583680.png">
	
	<h2>Down to $1/month the price went.</h2>

	<p>At this point I was simply testing if people would actually even pay <em>any</em> money for this.</p>

	<p>Another couple of days went by. I was getting increasingly nervous seeing ad money leave my bank account and into Zuckerberg’s. No sales, but at least Stephen thought Mitch would like it though.</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/a007f2671d5080b3a8bbc3239d26007d.png">

	<p>Facebook ads were clearly not going my way. Maybe my creative was bad, Facebook’s algorithm hadn’t warmed up yet, or, most likely, the idea was just something people didn’t want to pay for.</p>

	<p>Either way, the ads were killed, and I directed by Chrome tab towards ogusers.com, where everyone loves rare usernames.</p>

	<h2>The scary world of OGUsers</h2>

	<p>Now, OGUsers is quite a scary place. A lot of the people on there sell Instagram accounts with rare handles that they’ve obtained in, what I can imagine is, not the most ethical way. However, they seemed like my perfect target audience: people who loved rare usernames.</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/e6b8b5c6ea3d2888aac19a3870fa85b1.png">

	<p>I sheepishly put my website onto the “General Discussion” forum. It got a fair bit of interest, but no bites.</p>

	<h2>Well.. what do I do now?</h2>
	
	<p>I’d created Earlyname.com, a website that sends you new products and tells you if your super rare username is available on them. But, nobody so far seemed to want to pay for a service like this.</p>

	<p>It was time for plan b.</p>
	
	<h2>Plan B.</h2>
	
	<p>Or should I say: Plan Free.</p>

	<p>Earlyname was going to be free to use. Free would mean lots of people would give me their email and sign up. I’d then have a massive email list, and revenue would be generated from all the companies who wanted to feature on that list.</p>

	<p>I didn’t want to completely scrap all the beautiful paid subscription code I’d written though. Therefore, on a whim, I left a little checkbox that you could click with the text: “(Optional) - Reserve usernames for me - $10/mo”.</p>

	<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/cb712062c7e828f36924c79d47f9abcc.png">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, we have seen an uptick of JavaScript tools being written in languages other than JavaScript. This blog post lists a few examples and explains the appeal of not using JavaScript.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="examples">Examples&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1313505014275596288">I asked on Twitter</a> and these are a few of the examples that people mentioned:</p>
<p><strong>Build tools and compilers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/evanw/esbuild">esbuild – Go</a>: JavaScript bundler and minifier. It packages up JavaScript and TypeScript code for distribution on the web.
<ul>
<li>Used by: <a href="https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack">Snowpack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vite">Vite</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo">Hugo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swc-project/swc">swc – Rust</a>: JavaScript/TypeScript compiler</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/google/closure-compiler">Google Closure Compiler – Java</a>: JavaScript checker and optimizer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linters and code formatters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RDambrosio016/RSLint">RSLint – Rust</a>: JavaScript linter</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/facebook/flow">Flow – OCaml</a>: static typechecker for JavaScript</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dprint/dprint">dprint – Rust</a>: code formatting platform</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Managing command line tools:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm">Fast Node Manager (fnm) – Rust</a>: Node.js version manager</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/volta-cli/volta">Volta – Rust</a>: manage JavaScript command-line tools such as <code>node</code>, <code>npm</code>, <code>yarn</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-other-languages%3F">Why other languages?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>What are the benefits of using languages other than JavaScript (or languages that compile to JavaScript)?</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be compiled to native binaries which have faster startup times.</li>
<li>Native binaries also usually run considerably faster than JavaScript code.</li>
<li>Many languages make it much easier to parallelize code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, many non-JavaScript languages can now be compiled to WebAssembly, resulting in binaries that are almost as portable as JavaScript – and integrate well with it.</p>
<p>Given that each language has its own specialties, a non-JS language may also be better suited for a given task. For example, OCaml/ReasonML, Haskell, and other functional languages support algebraic data types, which help with processing data structures such as abstract syntax trees that are used when parsing and/or compiling formal languages.</p>
<h3 id="upsides-of-using-javascript">Upsides of using JavaScript&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Using JavaScript also has benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s easier to find contributors for tools: On one hand, programmers familiar with the non-JS language tend to be less interested in working on JavaScript-related tools. On the other hand, a non-JS language is a considerable hurdle for JavaScript programmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can “dog-food” – apply a language tool to the code of the tool itself. As a consequence, working on the tool’s code base gives you a better idea of what you want from the tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript has a rich ecosystem with a language specification, much documentation, good tools and many libraries (via npm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For functional programming, TypeScript is not as elegant as specialized languages, but you can get relatively close without losing the JavaScript ecosystem. For example, discriminated union types are slightly more verbose than algebraic data types, but have many of the same benefits (such as compile-time exhaustiveness checks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If high performance is important, <a href="https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript">AssemblyScript</a> may be an option: It is a strict variant of TypeScript that is compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<![CDATA[Declarative Key Management with NixOps, Pass, and Nix-Plugins]]>
            </title>

October 7, 2020 | https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://elvishjerricco.github.io/2018/06/24/secure-declarative-key-management.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://nixos.org/nixops/">NixOps</a> is a declarative deployment tool
for <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, the purely functional Linux
distribution. NixOps is traditionally used for cloud deployments,
while personal NixOS machines are usually configured with
<code>nixos-rebuild</code>. But NixOps can be used to configure your personal
machine as well. All my NixOS machines are configured with a file
looking something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>my-machine</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>deployment</span><span>.</span><span>targetHost</span> <span>=</span> <span>"localhost"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>imports</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>./hardware-configuration.nix</span> <span>./configuration.nix</span><span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By deploying my machine with NixOps, I can provision other resources
simultaneously, like a private EC2 instance for VPN, and an S3 bucket
to store the build cache for the Hydra server running on my desktop.</p>



<p>With NixOS, almost anything you put in your system configuration is
likely to be placed in the Nix store. <code>etc</code> files, for instance.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># configuration.nix</span>
<span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>etc</span><span>.</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>readFile</span> <span>./foo</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-l</span> /etc/foo
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 Jun 24 03:32 /etc/foo -&gt; /etc/static/foo

<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-l</span> /etc/static
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 51 Jun 24 03:32 /etc/static -&gt; /nix/store/jx8wna7pamzwsan81g1lkvk6i48m05qc-etc/etc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the <code>foo</code> file ultimately links back to a file in
<code>/nix/store</code>. This is because a NixOS configuration is just an
ordinary Nix derivation, so everything involved must be in the Nix
store. This is good for reasons like reproducibility and rollbacks,
but bad for secrets. Since the Nix store is globally readable to all
users, any secrets that end up there are as well. To avoid this,
NixOps has <a href="https://nixos.org/nixops/manual/#idm140737318276736">a key management
feature</a> for
deploying keys without putting them in the Nix store.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>deployment</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>.</span><span>secret-foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>readFile</span> <span>./secret-foo</span><span>;</span>
    <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>"will"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>group</span> <span>=</span> <span>"wheel"</span><span>;</span>
    <span>permissions</span> <span>=</span> <span>"0640"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Including this module in one of your NixOps deployments instructs
NixOps to perform an extra step where it copies the contents of
<code>secret-foo</code> from the Nix expression to <code>/run/keys/secret-foo</code> on the
target machine without ever touching the Nix store. <code>/run/keys</code> is a
temporary file system, so by default the keys won’t even hit the
disk. NixOps commands will make sure to redeploy keys when you run
<code>nixops reboot</code>, but you can’t use this command for to reboot a
machine that deploys to itself, since the <code>nixops</code> process attending
the reboot will be shut down. The <code>destDir</code> option can be used to
store the keys on disk instead, which is fine for me since my disk is
encrypted.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>deployment</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>.</span><span>secret-foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>readFile</span> <span>./secret-foo</span><span>;</span>
    <span>destDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/secrets"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Keys deployed with NixOps are <strong>not</strong> deleted from the
target machine when you remove the declaration from the Nix
configuration. This is a shortcoming in NixOps, so remember to delete
keys not stored in <code>/run/keys</code> manually when removing them from the
configuration.</p>



<p>I keep all my system configurations in a git repo that I sync with my
server. For more reasons than one, secrets should not be checked into
this repo in plaintext. But I do want some secrets deployed to several
machines in plaintext. <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">Pass, the “standard” unix password
manager</a> is a convenient, useful tool
for keeping secrets encrypted and synced via Git. This is the tool I
use to keep secrets synced across machines.</p>

<p>It’s not possible by default to access <code>pass</code> keys in Nix. But there
are a couple of ways to make it possible.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation</code> option in Nix
gives access to a <code>builtins.exec</code> function, which is sort of like
<code>unsafePerformIO</code> in Haskell. It can be used to execute arbitrary
commands and parse their stdout as a Nix expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#conf-plugin-files">Nix plugins</a> are
just shared libraries that are loaded at runtime via command line
option to extend the Nix interpreter. This is more precise, so we
can use it to avoid giving all Nix code access to <code>exec</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Though option 1 is much more convenient, option 2 is more technically
preferable. To avoid the inconvenience of having to write C++ and
understand the Nix API, Shea Levy has created
<a href="https://github.com/shlevy/nix-plugins">nix-plugins</a>, a single Nix
plugin that lets you add your own plugins written in Nix by providing
priveledged access to <code>exec</code>. This restores much of the convenience of
option 1.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># configuration.nix</span>
<span>{</span> <span>pkgs</span><span>,</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>nix</span><span>.</span><span>extraOptions</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span><span>
</span><span>    plugin-files = </span><span>${</span><span>pkgs</span><span>.</span><span>nix-plugins_4</span><span>.</span><span>override</span> <span>{</span> <span>nix</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>.</span><span>nix</span><span>.</span><span>package</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span><span>/lib/nix/plugins/libnix-extra-builtins.so</span><span>
</span><span>  ''</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This configuration will give your Nix interpreter an
<code>extra-builtins-file</code> option, which you can use to write plugins in
Nix. The <code>nix</code> package is overridden to ensure that <code>nix-plugins</code> is
built with the version of Nix that your system has. You can also
always use <code>--option plugin-files /nix/store/.../libnix-extra-builtins.so</code> to
avoid having to bootstrap <code>nix-plugins</code> into your configuration.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple plugin that execs <code>echo \"hello\"</code> to return the
string “hello” to Nix.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># extra-builtins.nix</span>
<span>{</span> <span>exec</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>hello</span> <span>=</span> <span>exec</span> <span>[</span><span>"echo"</span> <span>"</span><span>\"</span><span>hello</span><span>\"</span><span>"</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>bash$ nix repl --option extra-builtins-file $(pwd)/extra-builtins.nix

nix-repl&gt; builtins.extraBuiltins.hello
"hello"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>exec</code> can be used to run <code>pass</code>, which will then be run as a child of
the process running the Nix interpreter; i.e. as your user and in your
shell, not as the user running the nix-daemon. This means it’ll
properly prompt your TTY for your master password. <code>exec</code> requires
that the stdout of the process is formatted as a Nix expression, so a
wrapper is needed to reformat the output of <code>pass</code> to a Nix
expression.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

<span># nix-pass.sh</span>

<span>set</span> <span>-euo</span> pipefail

<span>f</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>mktemp</span><span>)</span>
<span>trap</span> <span>"rm </span><span>$f</span><span>"</span> EXIT
pass show <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>$f</span>
nix-instantiate <span>--eval</span> <span>-E</span> <span>"builtins.readFile </span><span>$f</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># extra-builtins.nix</span>
<span>{</span> <span>exec</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>pass</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>exec</span> <span>[</span><span>./nix-pass.sh</span> <span>name</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you call this function with a password name from your
password-store, you will be prompted for your master password and the
contents of that password will be returned to Nix.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nix-repl&gt; builtins.extraBuiltins.pass "secret-foo"
"bar\n"
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Finally, we can use this to deploy a key from an encrypted
password-store to the file system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}:</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>deployment</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>.</span><span>secret-foo</span><span>.</span><span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>builtins</span><span>.</span><span>extraBuiltins</span><span>.</span><span>pass</span> <span>"secret-foo"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>bash<span>$ </span>nixops deploy <span>-d</span> my-deployment <span>--option</span> extra-builtins-file <span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>/extra-builtins.nix
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can configure the <code>extra-builtins-file</code> option in <code>nix.conf</code> so
you never need to specify it, but I don’t recommend giving all Nix
evaluations access to your password store. If the gpg-agent still has
the master password cached, you won’t be prompted and your secret
could leak to less trustworthy Nix code.</p>



<p>This takes a bit of setup, but it achieves highly declarative secret
management. Secrets are safely shared between trusted machines,
protected by GPG, and deployed to machines simply by declaring the
password-store name and destination. This can be used for both local
machines and remote NixOps deployments, so this could even be a sane
way to deploy secrets to production environments.</p>

        <p><strong>Crowdsourcing has drawn a lot of attention as a way of predicting and mapping future coronavirus hotspots based on user-reported symptoms. However, it’s also an increasingly popular approach to software application testing, engineering, and quality assurance.</strong></p>
<p>Software crowdsourcing is making inroads in the software industry, as it gives companies quicker and less costly ways of developing and testing apps that meet users’ real needs. Meanwhile, individual crowdsourced testers, also known as crowdtesters, are earning money through remote work, ranging from a few dollars for each detected bug to weekly salaries of $2,000 and up.</p>
<p>Is software crowdtesting a panacea, though? The answer is “No.”</p>
<p>In crowdsourcing, people can contribute to a collaborative platform over the Internet from wherever they are. It’s well known outside the software development field. As one example, there’s the Wikipedia online collaborative encyclopedia. A couple of others are <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a> and <a href="https://stackexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Exchange</a>, web-based platforms where people ask and answer each other’s questions. Crowdsourcing has also made headlines lately as a way of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-near-you-crowdsources-data-to-predict-new-hotspots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicting and mapping future COVID-19 hotspots</a> based on user-reported symptoms.</p>
<p>In software development, crowdsourcing is used in design, requirements analysis, and coding. But as a business endeavor, crowdsourcing is getting especially prevalent in testing and quality assurance tasks. Businesses, as requesters, delegate tasks to outside individuals or groups, as providers, with the support of crowdsourcing platforms. The business pays a fee to the crowdsourcing platform, which then performs various degrees of candidate vetting and task management. The crowdsourcing company also handles payments to testers.</p>
<p>The global crowdsourcing testing market is set to soar from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $2.0 billion in 2024, says a <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/crowdsourced-testing.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent report from Markets &amp; Markets</a>. The analysts anticipate growth to be particularly strong in two areas: <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-mobile-testing-gotchas-you-need-to-know-about/">mobile testing</a>, for making sure apps run smoothly on various phones and tablets; and location testing, for seeing to it that language and cultural nuances are well suited to local end users in various countries.</p>
<h3>What’s the appeal?</h3>
<p>Without hiring extra inhouse staff, a company can easily gain extra tech talent for projects at a relatively low cost. This is true whether an organization needs an army of usability testers in 50 nations or <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-testers-should-know-about-domain-knowledge/">an expert individual in a specialized tech area</a>, such as iOS app design.</p>
<p>Software crowdsourcing does have its downsides, though. “We use software crowdsourcing in our deployments, but while valuable, we use it sparingly, only for initial testing of new deployments where we don’t have the experience to run the basic tests,” notes David Johnson, CTO at <a href="http://mulyticlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mulytic Labs</a>. “We do not base our whole testing strategy around crowdsourcing as it presents too much risk and not enough consistency.”</p>
<p>Before drilling down into the pros and cons of software crowdtesting, here’s a quick look at the evolution of software crowdsourcing.</p>
<h3>Evolution of crowdsourcing</h3>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/06/crowds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2006 Wired article</a>, Jeff Howe defined crowdsourcing as representing “the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it to an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call.”</p>
<p>Yet the concept predated the term. Linus Torvalds, originator of the Linux operating system, is widely credited as an early practitioner of crowdsourcing. When he was a 21-year-old student at the University of Helsinki in Finland way back in 1991, Torvalds put up a quick message on Usenet’s comp.os.minix newsgroup: “<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m doing a (free) operating system</a> (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in Minix,” Torvalds wrote. He ultimately lured so many developers that Linux 1.0 was accomplished in just three years.</p>
<p>IDC estimates that today, 24.2 million developers worldwide are <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/wheres-the-yelp-for-open-source-tools/">contributing to open source projects</a>, including Linux, LibreOffice, the GIMP photo editing tool, the GNU compiler collection, and many more. Open source developers often are motivated by factors such as the ability to learn new skills, gain recognition, and support a worthy cause. While the contributors aren’t paid directly, many benefit financially, such as contributing while working as paid employees for commercial software organizations.</p>
<h3>The microtasking crowdsourcing model</h3>
<p>However, the paying side of crowdsourcing is a totally different animal from open source. It has itself become, well, crowded with competing platforms.</p>
<p>Many online labor markets use a model known as microtasking. Microtasks are intended to be done in a matter of minutes. Collectively, though, the microtasks add up to a solution for a more complex task.</p>
<p>Some microtasking platforms, such as <a href="https://test.io/become-a-tester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test IO</a>, are designed for detecting software defects and pay crowdtesters on a “per bug” basis. Test IO’s testers can generally expect to receive anywhere from $5 for a “low severity bug” to <a href="https://www.wayup.com/i-Computer-Software-j-Crowdtester-Website-and-application-testing-testCloud-758785/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$50 for a “critical bug.”</a></p>
<p>Other sites, such as <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/get-paid-to-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UserTesting.com</a> and <a href="https://www.trymyui.com/worker/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TryMyUI</a>, focus on testing usability, or on applications’ “user-friendliness.” UserTesting.com pledges to return usability tests within an hour. TryMyUI requires no previous experience in software testing and pays $10 per 20-minute online review.</p>
<p>You’ll also find individual sites that <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/collaborative-software-development-platforms/#:~:text=Current%20crowdsourcing%20platforms%2C%20such%20as,example%2C%20see%20the%20sidebar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supply a wide range of crowdtesting services</a> and are looking for testers. A recent glance at the project board on <a href="https://www.utest.com/projects?tab=suggested" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uTest</a>’s site showed gigs involving bug testing, usability testing, mobile testing, PC game testing, and localization testing. uTest pays on a <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-do-you-earn-on-uTest-freelancing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“per performance” basis</a>, depending on the gig type. Some project needs are quite specific, such as Android testers with accessibility switch devices, or people with native Australian, New Zealand, or UK accents.</p>
<p>At the top end of the pay spectrum, testers specializing in cybersecurity have reportedly earned anywhere from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars per security bug detected, either directly from tech companies like Google, Facebook, or Mozilla or through cybersecurity crowdsourcing platforms like <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bugcrowd</a> and <a href="https://www.synack.com/lp/synacks-crowdsourced-penetration-testing-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/crowdsourced-testing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crowdtesting can also come into play</a> in areas that include <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/discerning-the-difference-functional-testing-vs-non-functional-testing/">functional testing</a>, for making sure that applications comply with company-specified requirements; compatibility testing, for <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-the-challenges-of-cross-browser-testing/">testing software across various browsers</a> and operating systems; <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/regression-testing-what-you-need-to-know/">regression testing</a>, to find out whether a software change broke existing functionality; and connectivity testing, to check out issues related to network connectivity.</p>
<h3>The contest model</h3>
<p>In another model, companies including <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Topcoder,</a> <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeetCode,</a> <a href="http://codeforces.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeforces,</a> and <a href="https://www.codechef.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeChef</a> gamify crowdtesting by treating workers as contestants. Typically, after a client proposes a project, a coordinator – called a “copilot” at Topcoder – <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2016/01/mso2016010074/13rRUzpzez2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decomposes the project into tasks</a> or “competitions.” The contests might revolve around requirements, architecture, UI design, implementation, or testing, for example, with each task lasting a matter of days.</p>
<p>Contestants offer competing solutions. From this pool, a winner and runner-up are chosen. Workers who complete the task and has their solution chosen is paid either a bounty award or an hourly wage.</p>
<p>Topcoder, a pioneer of the contest model, has reportedly awarded more than $25,000 per day to contestants. What’s more, after proving themselves in various skill sets in competitions, participants become eligible for Topcoder’s Gig Work engagements. <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/gigs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gig Work assignments</a> cover the whole gamut of software disciplines; a recent search turned up job titles such as QA lead, testing lead, and cloud testing lead. Typically paying $1,000 to $3,200 a week for U.S. workers, these Gig Work jobs may be as short as a month and as long as a year.</p>
<p>These are independent consulting engagements. As with other independent contractors in today’s gig economy, the crowdsourced workers don’t receive the same benefits that full-time employees might expect, such as health insurance or &nbsp;vacation leave. Nor are they eligible for state unemployment assistance when a job terminates. Plus, there’s no guarantee that crowdsourced work provides the remote workers with a consistent income level. But freelancers are already familiar with that scenario.</p>
<h3>Advantages for software teams</h3>
<p>What are the specific advantages of crowdtesting to software teams? Speed, cost effectiveness, and language testing top the list, according to some practitioners.</p>
<h4>Fast speed</h4>
<p>“Crowdsourcing allows you to hire a large number of people who can quickly test the software in diverse environments, with 24/7 coverage,” says Dan Kelly, founder and senior partner at <a href="https://www.thenegotiator.guru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Negotiator Guru,</a> a company specializing in sourcing, negotiating, and managing complex IT contracts.</p>
<p>For example, Microsoft worked with Wipro and crowdsourcing platform Topcoder to increase testing speeds for its Microsoft Teams product to match the development release cadence, executing 24-hour testing cycles for Teams every week. “Via on-demand testing on Topcoder, ramp-up and ramp-down was made simple and a worldwide community of testers continuously provided feedback and documented defects, while helping Microsoft achieve wider test coverage across more devices and operating systems,” <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/case-studies/microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a written statement</a> from Topcoder.</p>
<p>How has crowdtesting gone at Mulytic Labs? “We’ve been able to get initial testing done very quickly with crowdsourcing and to find initial bugs that would have taken us more time and energy than desired,” Johnson says. At first, results from crowdtesters weren’t as detailed as the company wanted, but the company has since made changes to resolve that situation.</p>
<h4>Low cost</h4>
<p>”When you crowdsource your testing, you don’t need to shell out a salary for an employee, something which can make a significant dent in a project’s budget,” remarks Tomasz Hanke, team leader at <a href="https://www.startnearshoring.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">startne…</a></p></div></div>

</p>

  <p>Lisp and Haskell are arguably some of the more peculiar languages out there.
It is always interesting to compare languages, so let me entertain you with
a story how I finally decided which of them is better.</p>
<p>When I first found out about Common Lisp it took my breath away. Seriously,
Lisp has consistent syntax, good design, and unique metaprogramming
capabilities. After Common Lisp, I learned a few other languages, some of
them out of necessity, others because of curiosity: Python, JavaScript,
Prolog, Clojure, and Haskell. I also was doing C and C++ in the past, but I
don’t touch them now. Until recently I considered Common Lisp the best
language I know, and probably the most powerful language in existence.</p>
<p>The fact is, I know what Common Lisp is and what it can do, but the days
when I actually hacked Lisp (more or less) regularly are long gone, and I’m
mainly doing Haskell these days.</p>
<h2 id="goodbye-lisp">Goodbye, Lisp</h2>
<p>Today I actually have had a chance to compare my productivity with Common
Lisp and Haskell. I decided to spend a few hours on my open source projects.
First, I refactored <a href="https://github.com/mrkkrp/megaparsec">Megaparsec</a>, and that was nice and easy,
but I didn’t notice this because I’m already used to the level of efficiency
Haskell gives me.</p>
<p>Next, a user of one of my Common Lisp libraries opened an issue asking to
improve one thing a bit. I estimated the required work in 15 minutes of time
and started Common Lisp hacking for the first time in a couple of months.</p>
<p>It took about 1 hour to write about 20 lines of trivial code. Of course one
might say that I just forgot the details. Yet, from my point of view the
real reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Common Lisp is dynamically typed and the compiler cannot help you when you
write your code. (Well, it can help you a bit, making sure that your code
is syntactically correct and all your declared variables are used for
something.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Lisp mixes functional code with code that has side effects. To
write idiomatic Common Lisp, you usually have to mix functional code with
not-so-functional approaches. See how this works below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common Lisp’s standard library (the functions that are available to you as
part of the ANSI Common Lisp standard) is quite poor by modern standards.
A lot of useful functions are missing. There are libraries, but I’ll get
to them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s essential for that library I was working on to have minimal
dependencies, so I came up with this function in bare Common Lisp to add
padding to every line of text except for the first line:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span><span> add-text-padding </span><span>(str &amp;key padding newline)</span>
<span>  </span><span>"Add padding to text STR. Every line except for the first one, will be</span>
<span>prefixed with PADDING spaces. If NEWLINE is non-NIL, newline character will</span>
<span>be prepended to the text making it start on the next line with padding</span>
<span>applied to every single line."</span>
<span>  (</span><span>let</span><span> ((str (</span><span>if</span><span> newline</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>concatenate</span><span> 'string (</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>#\N</span><span>ewline) str)</span>
<span>                 str)))</span>
<span>    (</span><span>with-output-to-string</span><span> (s)</span>
<span>      (</span><span>map</span><span> 'string</span>
<span>           (</span><span>lambda</span><span> (x)</span>
<span>             (</span><span>princ</span><span> x s)</span>
<span>             (</span><span>when</span><span> (</span><span>char=</span><span> x </span><span>#\N</span><span>ewline)</span>
<span>               (</span><span>dotimes</span><span> (i padding)</span>
<span>                 (</span><span>princ</span><span> </span><span>#\S</span><span>pace s))))</span>
<span>           str))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In case you don’t speak Common Lisp, let me highlight some parts of the
code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>concatenate</code> needs to know the type of its output, so we pass it a symbol
specifying type of desired result as the first argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(string #\Newline)</code> constructs a line containing a single newline
character. There is no syntax in Common Lisp to write something like
<code>"\n"</code>. The alternative approach would be <code>(format nil "~%")</code>. There is no
syntax for all other special characters if you want to put them into
string. To be fair, you have multi-line string literals without funny
escaping instead, which is vital for doc-strings and the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(map 'string …)</code> is used to loop through characters in a string. Note
that here we use <code>map</code> function as a helper for a rather imperative
procedure—printing results to new string using a temporarily created
stream <code>s</code> (with the help of <code>with-output-to-string</code>). But that’s
idiomatic in Common Lisp.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When I ran this in the REPL, I got the following:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>; SLIME 2015-10-18</span>
<span>CL-USER&gt; (asdf:load-system :unix-opts)</span>
<span>T</span>
<span>CL-USER&gt; (</span><span>in-package</span><span> :unix-opts)</span>
<span>#&lt;PACKAGE </span><span>"UNIX-OPTS"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>OPTS&gt; (</span><span>defvar</span><span> *foo* </span><span>(</span><span>format</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>"first line~%second line~%third line"</span><span>))</span>
<span>*FOO*</span>
<span>OPTS&gt; *foo*</span>
<span>"first line</span>
<span>second line</span>
<span>third line"</span>
<span>; compiling (DEFUN ADD-TEXT-PADDING ...)</span>
<span>OPTS&gt; (add-text-padding *foo* :padding </span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
<span>; Evaluation aborted on #&lt;TYPE-ERROR expected-type: CHARACTER datum: NIL&gt;.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The debugger popped up and told me in plain English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value NIL is not of type CHARACTER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to argue with, <code>nil</code> is definitely not a character. But why
the heck do I get this? Can you tell? Please try as hard as you can! <em>(The
answer is at the end of the blog post.)</em></p>
<p>I decided that I won’t hack Common Lisp anymore. That’s great and expressive
language, but I want to write in something I’m efficient with.</p>
<h2 id="productivity-of-haskell-programmer">Productivity of Haskell programmer</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for almost everything that is
related to text. One package I love in particular is
<a href="http://www.flycheck.org/">Flycheck</a>. When I edit Haskell source code,
Flycheck is running GHC with <code>-Wall</code> flag and
<a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint">HLint</a> in the background and displays
warnings and errors interactively underlining my source code. This is a
convenient feature for any language, but only Haskell with its type system
takes this sort of tool to its limits.</p>
<p>In fact, this non-stop interactive conversation with compiler is the most
efficient programming workflow I’ve ever used. Combined with the fact that
<em>if your code compiles, it probably works</em>, Haskell must be the most
efficient (with respect to human resources) programming language in
existence just because of the static type system that works as a powerful
ally for the programmer. Of course, bugs can live in Haskell code too, but
I’m not saying we should abandon writing tests.</p>
<h2 id="problems-of-common-lisp">Problems of Common Lisp</h2>
<p>Speaking of tests, recently I discovered that Zach Beane AKA Xach, an
über-level Common Lisp hacker <a href="http://xach.livejournal.com/278047.html?thread=674335#t674335">doesn’t usually write tests</a>.
FYI, he is the author of <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>, that is something like (but
not quite) Cabal or Stack. Quicklisp is de-facto the only widely used
library manager in Common Lisp world, and so it’s written in Common Lisp and
<a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client">doesn’t have any tests</a>. It is a wonder for me how it
works. Usually when a project is big enough I start to have doubts whether
all parts of it still work after some changes, so I cannot imagine you can
do a thing like Quicklisp without tests and be confident about the result.</p>
<p>But you know what, Lisp, and its most advanced dialect (IMO), Common Lisp is
really cool. If you don’t believe me, you can read <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">Paul Graham</a> at any
time. The author can tell you what a great language Common Lisp is on
many-many pages. I don’t remember where I read this, but he has something
like “There is the problem of lacking libraries, but on a big enough project
benefits of the language itself outweigh the lack of libraries.”</p>
<p><em>Well, take any high-level language like Python, which have all the nice
libraries, and for project of any size it will be better than Common Lisp.
Macros are missing, but you can live without macros after all.</em></p>
<p>Common Lisp doesn’t have enough high-quality, actively maintained libraries.
The fact is, there are some pearls like <a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/caveman">caveman</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm">stumpwm</a>, but most libraries don’t look good enough. Sometimes you
start thinking that if you want to end up with a great project you’ll need
to write your own libraries (which you’ll probably do, like many people
before you, not that it has improved the situation though).</p>
<p>Another problem is that some widely-used Common Lisp libraries have no
documentation at all. If you’re to understand how to use them, <em>read the
source code</em>. I can name a couple of them, but I don’t want to do so,
because I don’t think it’s polite. I’ve opened an issue on GitHub of one
quite popular library, asking the maintainer to write documentation. After 6
months it’s still not written (strange, right?). In my opinion, this is not
a serious approach to maintaining your code.</p>
<p>When I was interested in Common Lisp, I had an idea of a pet project to help
me remember all sorts of French words and verbs in particular. Of course I
wanted to do the whole thing decently, even though it’s console app, it
should have decent interface and work smoothly in general. I succeeded, but
I had to do a lot more than I would need to do if I wrote it in, say Python.
This is how (in retrospect I understand) less powerful Python would be
better fit for this (or almost any) project.</p>
<h2 id="the-curse-of-dynamic-languages">The curse of dynamic languages</h2>
<p>There is a blog post called <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/"><em>Dynamic Languages are Static
Languages</em></a>. In short, the author makes the point that
dynamic langauges are static languages but with one huge type including all
possible values. Here is a paragraph I find important:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this is precisely what is wrong with dynamically typed languages:
rather than affording the <em>freedom</em> to ignore types, they instead impose
the <em>bondage</em> of restricting attention to a <em>single</em> type! Every single
value has to be a value of that type, you have no choice! Even if in a
particular situation we are absolutely certain that a particular value is,
say, an integer, we have no choice but to regard it as a value of the “one
true type” that is <em>classified</em>, not typed, as an integer. Conceptually,
this is just rubbish, but it has serious, tangible penalties. For one, you
are depriving yourself of the ability to state and enforce the <em>invariant</em>
that the value at a particular program point must be an integer. For
another, you are imposing a serious bit of run-time overhead to represent
the class itself (a tag of some sort) and to check and remove and apply
the class tag on the value each time it is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lack of the power to express meaning of your program on type level is
another downside of Lisp. (You can add types in Common Lisp too, but that’s
used solely for optimization. Common Lisp can be almost as fast …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section></section><section><div><p>Last year, I launched <a href="https://www.marcuswood.io/products/guess-the-throne">Guess the Throne</a>, a Game of Thrones death pool app. I built it with a friend of mine in two weeks and launched a few just before the final season premiered. We had one goal: achieve product/market fit. Oh boy did we!</p><p>Below are some of the lessons learned and what we wish we had done differently.</p><h2 id="dont-get-in-the-weeds"><a href="#dont-get-in-the-weeds" aria-label="dont get in the weeds permalink"></a>Don't get in the weeds</h2><p>We coded the bare minimum features for the app. At launch (and after), users couldn't even edit their entry name. That led to a bunch of really funny support emails asking for us to change their name because they created an entry with a very NSFW name 😅.</p><p>The big takeaway here is that people didn't miss that feature or any of the other features we left out. The faster you get your product in someone's hands the more actionable feedback you'll receive.</p><h2 id="be-scrappy"><a href="#be-scrappy" aria-label="be scrappy permalink"></a>Be Scrappy</h2><p>We launched the app with a $150 marketing budget. Most of our users came from engaging with communities on Reddit, Facebook, forums, podcasts, and Twitch. If you can engage the small communities, that'll lead to more growth and knowledge about your market. I wrote up a blog with how we marketed the app on <a href="https://www.marcuswood.io/blog/we-launched-a-product-with-150-here-s-what-happened">my website</a> if you'd like to read more.</p><h2 id="ads-arent-always-the-answer-for-growth"><a href="#ads-arent-always-the-answer-for-growth" aria-label="ads arent always the answer for growth permalink"></a>Ads Aren't Always the Answer for Growth</h2><p>If you have a small marketing budget I encourage you to think about the cost per conversion before considering ads, especially if your app is free/free to try. For example, we found a fan account on Twitter that had a bunch of followers. We reached out and they said for $20 they'd give us one tweet. We tried it out and the tweet blew up! Loads of people came to our site from that one tweet for a $0.20 cost per user, NOT cost per click.</p><h2 id="have-a-monetary-strategy"><a href="#have-a-monetary-strategy" aria-label="have a monetary strategy permalink"></a>Have a Monetary Strategy</h2><p>I will say that we didn't set out to make money off of this app, but once we started receiving thousands of requests per second I could feel my credit card catching fire 😱. By the time it had happened it was too late since we had never thought about making money. We tried making it donation based where we'd donate 50% to charity and 50% to keep the app up, but it only amounted to around $40. The cost for the servers were over $500.</p><h2 id="get-your-bearings"><a href="#get-your-bearings" aria-label="get your bearings permalink"></a>Get your Bearings</h2><p>This was the first product (after many tries) that took off to become popular. There's a variety of reasons I believe it did, but once you find success expand your lens to see the bigger landscape. Why did it become popular? What made it special? What's next? Don't be afraid to paint in broad strokes once you've found something special.</p><p>That leads me to today's launch of <a href="https://guesstherose.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guess the Rose</a>! It is a fantasy league for The Bachelor/Bachelorette that we built from the ground up with everything we learned from Guess the Throne. We want to create a suite of fun games for TV shows for people who want to play fantasy, but aren't into sports.</p><p>Please check it out and sign up if you're a fan of the show!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>9:00AM would hit. Shit.</p><p>I'd sit in my ergonomic chair with my ergonomic keyboard and my ergonomic mouse. All my gadgets perfectly positioned—making sure I was at least physically comfortable for another cluster-fuck of a morning.</p><p>Zoom booted up for our daily standup...</p><h5><strong>2019 B.L. Before Linear.</strong></h5><p>Before Linear, the process at our startup was Nickelodeon Slime. <em>Green, murky, questionable</em>. We used Notion at the time.</p><p><strong>Notion</strong></p><figure id="w-node-3d0209636f0b-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7dde60154b810b669c3b9e_Frame%202-min%20(6).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We had one Kanban board in Notion that housed everything. E-v-e-r-y-thing.</p><p>Anytime something came up—a customer ticket or random idea—we'd stick it there. It was a garbage-can of a backlog, and everyday, it would grow a little taller.</p><p>So, each morning, we'd hop on Zoom, chit chat, and decide what to work on THAT DAY from the 100+ tickets in Notion. This, not so shockingly, caused issues.</p><p>There was no goal, no prioritization, no forethought. The product suffered, the team suffered, and I suffered.</p><p>We needed to change our process and right at that time, we found a tool to help us do so--Linear.</p><h5><strong>2020 A.L. After Linear</strong></h5><p>We needed to make a change. Luckily, as we started talking about the problems with our process, we heard about a new Project Management tool called Linear. After a few months of iteration, here's what we did:</p><p>Step 1: Set the foundation</p><p>Step 2: Grooming on Fridays—weekly</p><p>Step 3.: Planning &amp; retro on Mondays—weekly</p><p>Step 4: Create 2-4 week Gantt chart—update weekly</p><h5><strong>Setting the foundation</strong></h5><p>We needed some foundational concepts that somehow got lost along the way. These were:</p><ol role="list"><li>Estimates</li><li>Weekly cycles</li><li>Kanban board</li></ol><h5><strong>Estimates</strong></h5><figure id="w-node-7c8b551e738a-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7dde85e46fb2460da7f544_Frame%2016-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Prior to Linear, we had no way of estimating work. We'd look at our giant list in Notion and not know if a card would take an hour or a month. So we started with a pretty simple formula:</p><ul role="list"><li>4 points = 1 full day of work</li><li>2 points = 1/2 day of work</li><li>1 point = 1/4 day of work</li><li>*If a ticket is larger than 4 points, it should be broken down into multiple tickets.</li></ul><p>This may seem small, but using estimates has been freaking KEY for us. On a high-level, it tells us that each person can do ~20 points of work per week (4 points/person/day x 5 days a week = 20 points). And with that, we can then plan for both the short and longer-term future—allowing us to make goals and know if we hit them.</p><p>Important to note, when we first started, it took us a while to accurately estimate a ticket. We've gotten better with trial and error and discussions during our weekly retros.</p><p>Lastly, all of this can easily be setup in Linear. Simply go to Settings → Team → General → Estimates sections. Then choose from Linear's pre-populated list of either Exponential, Fibonacci, Linear, and T-shirt size.</p><p>We use Exponential and I'd highly recommend it. Some of the others (i.e. T-shirt sizes) I find to be too abstract and confusing.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Weekly Cycles</strong></h5><figure id="w-node-882bda762a1f-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7dde919ca992cffc313513_Frame%2017-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The next issue was we never knew what and when we were going to work on something. As a remote team, this made things even more difficult—forcing us to have 30 minute to even hour long stand ups DAILY.</p><p>Our solution to this was to work on a weekly cycle, Monday through Friday, with no cooldown period. During our Monday planning, we add ~60 points to the cycle (20 points/person x 3 teammates = 60 points). Once the week begins, anyone on the team can take a ticket from the list of To Dos and start.</p><p>We chose a weekly cycle because for us, things constantly change and priorities switch quickly. We thought a longer cycle (2+ weeks), would feel too rigid and not give us the flexibility we often need.</p><p>Once again, you can easily set this up in Linear. Go to Settings → Team → Cycles. From here, define the day the Cycle starts, how long it lasts, and if you'd like to add a cooldown period.</p><p>You can then go back to your Team and view all the past, active, and upcoming Cycles.</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Kanban</strong></h5><figure id="w-node-e0dd73c2c208-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7dde9d333473ccf199d800_Frame%2021-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now that we have estimated tickets that live inside of a weekly cycle, the last piece missing was a way to view those tickets and their statuses visually. So Kanban we went.</p><p>We tried to keep it simple with all our tickets moving through 4 stages:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>To Dos.</strong> This is where all the tickets get slotted in at the beginning of the cycle. With only about 60 points to view here at any given time, it's never overwhelming or paralyzing to look at—unlike our old Notion flow.</li><li><strong>In Progress.</strong> When you assign yourself a ticket, it then moves to In Progress.</li><li><strong>QA.</strong> For the engineers on the team, we have a ticket automatically move to QA when they open a PR on that branch. This is an awesome and customizable integration Linear has with GitHub— highly recommend.</li><li><strong>Done.</strong> When a ticket is complete, it gets moved to Done. Cool.</li><li><strong>Canceled.</strong> Sometimes in a Cycle, a ticket might become moot. When this happens, we move it to canceled versus just archiving. This helps us remember when it comes time to do a Retro if something went wrong.</li></ol><p>Linear gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to creating workflows. Go to Settings → Team → Workflow. From here, you can add new stages with a type, name, description, and color. Linear also has this beautiful hint of delight where if you add a new stage, the progress icon changes automatically.</p><h5><strong>Friday Grooming</strong></h5><p>Now that we set up the foundational pieces, we need to use them in practice. That's when our Friday grooming sessions come into play.</p><p>On Fridays, we have a recurring meeting in the afternoon to either make new tickets or groom the backlog to get ready for our following Cycle. At first, we tried to bunch grooming, planning, and retro all on the same day—this quickly became too long and tiring. By moving grooming to Friday, it lets us get started on Monday quickly.</p><p>In terms of how we groom, if there's a new or updated feature, we often have a design ready to build from. In the week prior, we'll have held a few critique sessions, tweaking flows or adding in edge-cases.</p><p>To actually turn the designs into Linear issues, we use a handoff tool Contrast (spoiler this is our company). As Jono and Kris look through the designs, they quickly link designs in Contrast to Linear issues. Rather than taking screenshots, copying URLs, and typing in metadata—they simply select a frame, click the "Link" button, and paste that URL into a Linear issue.</p><figure id="w-node-75868b66b2c3-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7ddeb4f51b5e3d2697c164_Frame%2022-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>After pasting, Contrast automatically adds a pic of the frame, project name, page name, frame name, and a hyperlink back to it in Contrast. Once they've created the link, they can also view the issues directly in Contrast, letting them quickly go back-and-forth between the designs and associated issues.</p><p>This process helps us create organized and info-rich issues in Linear—insanely fast.</p><p>If you want to create issues without Contrast in Linear, this is also amazing. To create a new ticket—press "C", to change the estimate—hold shift + E, to assign someone—press "A", to add a label—press "L." Everything in Linear can be done using your keyboard—helping you create issues without taking a million years.</p><p>Lastly, we use Projects within Linear to help us stay organized and view our progress. When creating issues, we'll add them to the relevant project by pressing shift + P. This becomes incredibly helpful when we're working on multiple projects in the same cycle and want to know the status.</p><h5><strong>Retro + Planning</strong></h5><p>And then there is our Monday Retro and Planning. We've gotten these down to 30-45 minutes, which is truly amazing considering they used to take hours. After catching up about our wild weekends during COVID, we start with the Retro. For this, we split off for 5-10 minutes and individually write down:</p><ol role="list"><li>Things that went well during the past cycle</li><li>Things that didn't go well</li><li>Things to improve upon</li></ol><p>Once we've written our lists, I share my screen via Zoom, go to the previous Cycle in Linear, and add an issue from my Templates called "Retro." This template pre-populates the cards title and all the header sections—slick.</p><figure id="w-node-970a63859f6c-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7ddecc6892773c5a8500ba_Frame%2024-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>During the retro, we talk through what everyone wrote and mark it down in Linear. These sessions have really helped us pinpoint areas in our process that need fixing and give us some time to reflect on any achievements that happened in the previous week.</p><p>Once the Retro is done, which usually takes about 15 minutes, we move onto planning. At this point, based on our Friday grooming, this is very quick. We take a look at the tickets—with all the relevant information and estimates in our Backlog and simply add them to the current cycle.</p><p>Now, we're ready to start the week.</p><h5><strong>2-4 week Gantt</strong></h5><p>For a few weeks, the above was what our process looked like. Unfortunately, we were still having issues when it came to decision-making. It's easy to just plop some stuff in your Backlog and start working on it. It's much harder to figure out what is the <strong><em>most important</em></strong> thing you should be working on.</p><p>Prior to implementing a high-level Gantt, we really didn't have much of a North Star. We weren't doing a good job thinking ahead, mostly just reacting. Around this time, I listened to a great podcast by the Intercom guys about Inputs, Outputs, and Outcomes. The part that struck me the most was how they thought about "inputs" i.e. the information you take in and use to make decisions. After listening to them I realized we had shit inputs, which were leading to shiit outputs, and thus shiiit outcomes.</p><p>So, in order to have better outputs and outcomes, we needed better inputs. That's where the Gantt came in.</p><figure id="w-node-cb8ccbffa62c-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5f7ddedfdeeceb6619164408_Frame%2025-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>What's so beautiful about a Gantt chart is it visually shows what you <strong>could</strong> be working on weeks in advance. Not only that, it shows the order of those operations and if one activity is blocking another.</p><p>An important caveat here is that our Gantt isn't set-it and forget-it. We update it on a weekly basis. If new inputs come in, let's say a customer complaint or a sales opportunity, the Gantt can change. And here's the kicker—all the following weeks in the Gantt change as a result. For instance, if we now deem feature X as P1 and work on it today, then feature Y will be moved further out.</p><p>And this is what I love most about having a Gantt chart—it visually displays the ripple effect of any given decision. This, in turn, helps us think more clearly and …</p></div></div>

  <p>Emile Nijssen's Blog</p>

  
  
<p>So far, it's not looking great for earth. We're using too much resources and as a result we're seeing temperatures rise, which leads to many problems.</p>
<p>Alas, I don't have to educate you on <em>why</em> it's bad. Instead, I'd like to talk about <em>how</em> we could solve it. And I'd like to use something we're all familiar with already.</p>
<h2 id="capitalism-works">Capitalism Works</h2>
<p>Most countries in the world have adopted the capitalistic system because it <em>works</em>. As long as there is scarcity, whether it's time, material resources or manufacturing, a society will require <em>something</em> to distribute scarce things across people.</p>
<p>Capitalism itself makes sure companies compete for customers. Your product is either better or cheaper, or you die.</p>
<p>Companies are motivated to make cheaper, better products with less resources and time. It's a competitive system and we humans tend to love wars. Nowadays we've just replaced cannons with marketing and castles with big offices.</p>
<h2 id="money-works">Money Works</h2>
<p>We're currently using money as the common denominator. Time equals money, and money equals resources. And to make stuff, we need both time and resources.</p>
<p>Money works because trading money for a bread is a much better idea than trading a chicken for a bread, because money is much more divisible than a chicken.</p>
<p>The problem with money though, is that non-produtive members of society (I'm looking at you, Wall Street) who are unable to add value (e.g. bake a bread or build rockets), have designed games around money itself, to enrichen themselves. Money should be just a tool, but they made it a goal in itself. When that happened, that's where society ended and individualism began.</p>
<p>The result is that people that add little to no value to society still can end up with a lot of money. And therein lies the problem; we value money as a measure of what a person has contributed. But it only says something about what that person can buy.</p>
<p>Yet to buy stuff (e.g. a plane), stuff needs to be made. And making stuff takes up a lot of resources and time.</p>
<p>How other people sell their time is their own business, but the resources on earth are limited. It's the stupidity of our time to believe that a rich person has more right to earth's resources than a poor person. Yet we don't think twice about the extravagance lifestyle of celebrities, ceo's and the like. In fact, most are jealous of it and aspire to spend as much as they do.</p>
<p><strong>The thing is, we're all born equal and your slice of <del>pie</del> earth should be as equal as anyone's else.</strong></p>
<p>Money should be able to buy someone else's time, but not the earth's resources.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-kind-of-money">A new kind of money</h2>
<p>Money can be transfered, and thus you can earn or lose money. It's a simple zero-sum game.</p>
<p>We need a new kind of money, that can't be transfered, can't be earned, can't be loaned, can't be lost. It can only be spent. And everyone gets an equal amount.</p>
<p>This money represents your slice of earth. You can spend it however you like, but once you've run out, you've run out.</p>
<h2 id="the-ecocredit">The Ecocredit</h2>
<p>Imagine a world where your government gives you 10.000 ecocredits a month. A what? An ecocredit. It's a non-transferable currency that lives next to your euros, dollars, yen etc. Maybe we can show your balance in an app. Or maybe we can link it to your ID card. Whatever, we're good with technology, we'll figure that out.</p>
<p>Imagine in this world you go out to a groceries store. Hmm, beef. Ouch, 1000 ecocredits Ã¡nd $3. Better go for veggie meat, while that's also $3, it's only 150 ecocredits. Maybe next week when you've made that deadline you'll buy that delicious beef to celebrate.</p>
<p>And you drive back in your diesel car, fuel up and spend another 1500 ecocredits. And $60.</p>
<h2 id="let-the-companies-figure-it-out">Let the companies figure it out</h2>
<p>At first, we'll feel limited by what we can buy. And that's exactly the point! We've been spoiled by our lifestyle at the expense of poorer people, and even worse, future generations. It can't go on like this.</p>
<p>"<em>But I don't want to lose my lifestyle!</em>", I hear you cry. Well, I have good news. We're humans, and we're damn smart at solving problems. We just need the right motivation to get our asses off the couch.</p>
<p>So let companies figure it out. The companies currently producing beef? Let them figure out a way to make it better for the environment. Because if they don't, they'll go bankrupt. Maybe they'll transition to plant-based beef where you couldn't tell the difference. There's surely a huge demand!</p>
<p>Car companies? Well, I guess they're all electric very soon. And by going all-in, economies of scale will make sure the dollar-price will stay low. Fossil fuel cars will receive an old-timer status and maybe will only be driven once a year by enthousiasts. Eating meat might become something you'll only do on your birthday.</p>
<p>I trust enough in capitalism that companies will compete with each other to make the most environment-friendly, low-cost products. Because it's the only way they can survive.</p>
<h2 id="but-but-but">But, but, butâ€¦</h2>
<p>It's just an idea, slow down! Great ideas take time to develop.</p>
<h3 id="but-arent-we-going-to-see-a-black-market-for-meat-planes-and-whatnot">But aren't we going to see a black market for meat, planes and whatnot?</h3>
<p>Yeah, probably. But it's all about the bigger picture.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-if-im-out-of-ecocredits-that-month">But what if I'm out of ecocredits that month?</h3>
<p>I hope you have a few great friends. Better luck next month.</p>
<h3 id="but-how-are-we-going-to-determine-the-amount-of-ecocredits-for-a-product">But how are we going to determine the amount of ecocredits for a product?</h3>
<p>I don't know. It probably won't be perfect, but we gotta start somewhere. Over time we'll get better at it.</p>
<h3 id="but-nobody-is-going-to-get-this-at-first">But nobody is going to get this at first.</h3>
<p>Maybe we can start with 100.000 ecocredits a month. Then slowly build down to 10.000 until we're used to it.</p>
<h3 id="but-cant-i-just-ask-a-poor-person-to-buy-stuff-for-me">But can't I just ask a poor person to buy stuff for me?</h3>
<p>I think that must be made illegal.</p>
<h3 id="but">Butâ€¦</h3>
<p>Do you really want to see the world burn because you wanted so badly to eat that one-kilogram-steak on your holiday in Thailand? Get to fucking work!</p>

Choose a color palette</h2><p>A color palette is a set of colors used across your website - and thus your logo.</p><p>When it comes to choosing a color palette, I prefer to rely on the wisdom of the crowd. <a href="https://colorhunt.co/">ColorHunt</a> is a website where users submit their own color palettes and vote on their favorites. A great starting point is the "popular"&nbsp;section (click on the dropdown menu at the top of the page).</p><p>My process usually involves browsing around, "liking" a few of my favorites, and then choosing a winner. For this tutorial, I'll use <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/22272">this palette</a>:</p><figure id="w-node-5f353a67d8d2-5b4a6e45"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f6e714b8ea3116adf23eccf_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-25%20at%206.37.46%20PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>My color palette from ColorHunt</figcaption></figure><p>Note the hex colors (ex. #F9F7F7) that appear when you hover over a color - you'll need those later.</p><p>You don't have to use all the colors from your chosen palette - maybe you'll only use one! But it's good to have these defined ahead of time so you're not choosing a different shade of blue on every page of your site.</p><h2>2. Choose a Google Font</h2><p>Unless you're writing a 4th grade book report, you probably shouldn't use Comic Sans or Times New Roman. But you might not know where to look for one that does work.</p><p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> logos are the way to go - Google offers hundreds of fonts available for you to use, completely free. Start by typing your company name as it will appear in your logo at the top of the page - you'll see what your logo would look like in each font. </p><p>Maybe you'll spot something you like as you scroll down the page. If not, I'll start by recommending some of my favorites (in no particular order):</p><h3>Pathway Gothic One</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70eeb034c16312634614ef_Pathway%20Gothic%20One.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Shrikhand</h3><figure id="w-node-c35edfb48f1f-5b4a6e45"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70eeb96e03184f3e37be24_Shrikhand.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Poppins</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70eed205fc6a41a5da4b71_Poppins.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Eczar</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70eeda029689e4177fcad9_Eczar.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Pacifico</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70eee37bccfcbf60d273fc_Pacifico.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Alfa Slab One</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70ef07c09bec4d19319fa8_Alfa%20Slab%20One.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Luckiest Guy</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70ef21c718baac056991b7_Luckiest%20Guy.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Source Sans Pro</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70ef35a331941547f497cb_Source%20Sans%20Pro.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Rubik</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4acf32e17a9c037c4a6e65/5f70ef48805beb4f9f083213_Rubik.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3.

    <p>Writing quality software is hard. Sometimes, software breaks in entertaining
ways. However, when software runs everything from personal assistants like
Alexa and Google Home to banking to elections, some bugs can be much more
severe.</p>

<p>This past quarter, Armin Namavari and I tried teaching a class about how to
write software that sucks just a <em>little</em> less. We focused on common problems
in computer systems caused by certain kinds of silly (but very serious)
mistakes, such as issues of memory safety and thread safety. The core theme of
the class was, <em>What are common problems with systems programming right now?
How are people responding to those issues? How do those measures fall short?</em>
We wanted students to be aware of problems that have plagued the industry for
decades, and we wanted to teach students how to use tools and mental models
that people have developed to combat those issues. However, these tools are
imperfect, and we also wanted students to experience and understand the
limitations of such tools to be better aware of what to watch out for when
building systems.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In particular, we focused on teaching the Rust programming language as a way to
build better habits and combat mistakes endemic to C- and C++-based software.
In many ways, Rust <em>requires</em> good practices, and it has an educational
compiler with helpful error messages that help students learn. Additionally, we
looked at how lessons from Rust can be applied to write better code in C++, and
we taught students about tools that can be used to detect common mistakes
before they become a problem.</p>

<p>In contrast with a typical security class, we aimed to build a robust software
engineering aspect into the course, giving code-heavy assignments and trying to
improve students’ processes rather than merely giving awareness about common
problems. Our goal with this class was to train students to be better software
developers, regardless of what programming language they end up using.</p>

<p>I think the class went quite well, and student evaluations were extremely
positive. Even before the quarter ended, students told us that the class was
extremely helpful for implementing and debugging assignments in other classes.
We hope to teach the class again this coming fall, and are looking for input on
how it might be improved.</p>

<p>This blog post aims to be a summary of what we did, why we did it, and what we
are thinking about changing for the future. It’s long, but written so you can
skip around to whatever is interesting to you. Here’s an outline:</p>

## What is systems programming?

In this class, we wanted to focus on safety in systems programming &mdash; but what
*is* systems programming, anyways?

"Systems programming" is a frequently-used term that I have never heard a clear
definition for, despite specializing in this track in undergrad. While it is
used in many different ways, I think about it like this: **Systems programming
is when you spend more time thinking about hardware than humans.** An
application programmer must think, *what does a user of my software need, and
how can I implement that in code?* An application programmer might work with
different programming languages and libraries, but rarely needs to think about
exactly what the hardware is doing under the hood. By contrast, a systems
programmer must think, *how can I teach this hardware new tricks in order to do
the things we need to do?* A systems programmer spends much more time thinking
about when memory is allocated, when a processor might switch contexts, when
data might be passed over a network, etc.
-->

<!-- TODO: picture of restaurant -->

<!--
As an application developer, you spend more time implementing business logic using whatever programming languages and tools you've decided to use. You're trying to design something that fits within the physical constraints of whatever you're running on. As a systems programmer, you spend much more time thinking about when memory gets allocated, when a processor switches contexts, when data gets passed over a network, etc.

Humans are still important (I'll admit I deemphasized humans partially for the alliteration), but the focus is less on end users and more on supporting the application developers and the application software that builds on top

Diagram: trying to show humans walking on top, hardware on bottom, and application developers standing on top of the systems developers
Diagram: floor is programming languages, libraries, and abstractions
Have some plumbers, carpenters, etc under the floor, and application devs servicing customers on top

If a computer were a restaurant, systems programmers would be the plumbers etc, and application programmers would be the chefs, waiters, etc

Examples of systems software: the code generating directions for Google Maps, Google Chrome, the infrastructure that does transcription for Siri (not the AI algorithms, but everything in between your phone and the algorithms), banking infrastructure, car firmware, etc.
-->

<h2 id="what-is-safety-and-why-should-we-care">What is safety, and why should we care?</h2>

<p>Safety is an unfortunately vague term lacking a great definition, but for our
purposes, we’ll say <strong>safety is about avoiding harmful mistakes.</strong> I view
safety as being concerned with the subset of potentially serious bugs: if a
button on a website renders as purple instead of blue, that’s a bug we might
not care much about, but if bank account software allows users to withdraw the
same $1000 multiple times, or if autonomous vehicle software can fail under
certain circumstances, that’s a more concerning problem.</p>

<p>Safety is particularly relevant in systems programming because systems
programming is <em>hard</em>. Systems programming often involves pushing the limits of
what hardware can do, and often involves reasoning about the state of multiple
threads sometimes even distributed across thousands of machines. Additionally,
for performance and historical reasons, the majority of systems software is
written in C or C++, which are <em>notoriously</em> difficult to use correctly.
Reasoning about pointers and memory is hard, and C and C++ do little to help.
C/C++’s weak type systems and poorly defined
specifications mean they will happily accept <a href="https://www.radford.edu/ibarland/Manifestoes/whyC++isBad.shtml">clearly broken code with no
sensible
interpretation</a>.
Even worse, there are countless minefields where the languages’ poor designs
are just begging for mistakes to happen. Simple functions like <code>strcpy</code>, which
copies a string from one place in memory to another, are extremely easy to
misuse and have been the cause of countless <a href="https://pointerless.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/strcpy-security-exploit-how-to-easily-buffer-overflow/">security
vulnerabilities</a>.
The <code>strncpy</code> function was introduced to address the weaknesses of <code>strcpy</code>,
yet <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050107-00/?p=36773"><code>strncpy</code> turns out to be almost just as
bad</a>. Even
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7459630/how-can-a-format-string-vulnerability-be-exploited"><code>printf</code> can lead to security
vulnerabilities</a>
when called the wrong way.</p>

    </a>
    
</figure>

<p>Also, as systems software provides the foundation on which other software runs,
it’s particularly important to get right. Many real-world examples demonstrate
the severe impact of the aforementioned issues.  One of my favorite examples is
presented in <a href="http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-usenixsec2011.pdf">Comprehensive Experimental Analyses of Automotive Attack
Surfaces</a>.  It’s a great
read, but as a summary, the authors bought a popular car and attempted to find
as many ways as possible to remotely hijack the car without having physical
access. They examined vectors such as wireless key fobs, Bluetooth, and even
the tire pressure monitoring system (which uses wireless signals to transmit
information from sensors in the tires). Every vector was found to be
exploitable, many of them trivially so. For example, the Bluetooth software had
“over 20 calls to <code>strcpy</code>, none of which were clearly safe.” The authors only
looked at the first instance of <code>strcpy</code>, and found that it copies data to the
stack when handling a Bluetooth configuration command without checking the
length of the string. This results in a trivially exploitable buffer overflow
that allows a paired device to execute arbitrary code in the media system.
Since the subsystems in most cars lack isolation, compromising one subsystem
(such as the media player) can result in the compromise of the entire car. In
2015, researchers demonstrated this, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/">remotely killing a Jeep that was driving
on the
highway</a>.</p>

<p>This seems like something we should be talking about. Would you hand a
chemistry student a bunch of volatile chemicals that regularly explode in
professional labs without a robust discussion of safety?  Probably not. Yet
that’s effectively what our curriculums are doing. We’re handing students a
series of tools that professionals routinely shoot themselves in the foot with,
and we aren’t having a substantial discussion of precautions we can take to
avoid potentially life-threatening mistakes.</p>

<p>One might argue that the perils of strcpy are nothing like the dangers of a
fully-stocked chemistry lab; there’s no danger of students dying in front of
the computer here. (Well, we hope.) However, I argue that we deal with dangers
on a much larger scale.  One line of code can easily affect millions (or
billions) of people, and the impacts of our code can be much greater than we
realize, even when we aren’t working on software for cars (which <a href="https://www.safetyresearch.net/blog/articles/toyota-unintended-acceleration-and-big-bowl-%E2%80%9Cspaghetti%E2%80%9D-code">we’ve killed
people
with</a>)
or medical devices (which <a href="https://hackaday.com/2015/10/26/killed-by-a-machine-the-therac-25/">we’ve also killed people
with</a>). It
may seem that the worst-case bugs in a file sharing server would simply prevent
users from sharing files, but one such bug led to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/11/wannacry-cyber-attack-cost-nhs-92m-19000-appointments-cancelled/">significant disruption
of the National Health Service in the
UK</a>.
Non-critical emergencies had to be refused. It may seem that the worst-case
bugs in a web application library would simply take down some websites, but one
such bug led to the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">exfiltration of extremely sensitive data on nearly every
American adult with a credit
history</a>.</p>

<!--We've spent a lot of effort over the last three decades finding ways to improve
the safety of code. We have linters, which can detect unsafe patterns in code
(e.g. calls to `strcpy`, or use of uninitialized memory). We have fuzzers and
sanitizers, which can stress test our code and identify memory errors and data
races. Most promising (in my opinion), we have new progamming languages such as
Rust and Swift which are safer, competitive on performance, and showing
potential for replacing C and C++ in the settings that those languages have
typically dominated. These languages can prevent entire classes of mistakes
that keep recurring in C and C++ codebases even with the use of other safety
tools. Linters, sanitizers, fuzzers, and static analyzers all help to catch
mistakes, but they don't *prevent* them, and they can't catch everything. While
these new languages are not a panacea and have their own problems, they make
massive strides towards squashing issues we haven't been able to address via
other means. Despite having some of the best security and development practices
in the world, Google Chrome (written in C++) is still plagued with memory
errors that would have been entirely prevented with Rust. Recently, they found
that [70% of security vulnerabilities were caused by memory
errors](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety).-->

<p>Precautions and safety measures <em>do</em> exist, but people aren’t using them. Part
of this may be because the tooling isn’t good enough or easy enough to use.
Part of this may be because there hasn’t been enough time to see mass adoption.
But I think part of this may also be because of a lack of education and
awareness surrounding these issues. We can teach C and C++ and hope that
students will learn good habits and learn how to use static analyzers,
sanitizers, fuzzers, and safer languages on the job, but then have we not
failed them as educators? Seeing that software engineers keep making pretty
basic mistakes with critical impact, it seems that something is wrong and we
should be trying to do more.</p>

<h2 id="imagining-safety-education">Imagining safety education</h2>

<p>So, we should talk more about safety. But how should we go about it?</p>

<h3 id="should-there-be-a-safety-class">Should there be a “safety class”?</h3>

<p>In planning this class, we couldn’t find any other programming safety class out
there. Is that because no one has thought to do it yet, or is it because it is
better to teach safety in context alongside more central material?</p>

<p>Particularly because “safety” is so broad, it does seem helpful
to cover best practices and helpful tricks/tools while introducing new
material. However, there were two reasons we felt it might make sense to teach
a class entirely focused on safety.</p>

<p>First, teaching a separate safety class gives us room to experiment with
teaching new material that would be difficult to integrate into existing</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Cloud engineers <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-much-do-aws-google-and-microsoft-pay-cloud-talent">make six figures</a>. They work on <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/recipe-for-flying-cars">world-changing problems</a>. They have <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">rapidly-expanding career options</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And — unlike some other high-paying professions — if you know your stuff, <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/a-cloud-guru-unveils-state-of-cloud-learning-report">you can get hired without an expensive university degree</a>. Who <em>wouldn’t </em>want to work in the cloud?</p><p>Of course, it’s not quite so easy as that. Cloud skills are in demand and pay well because they’re scarce in the job market. And usually the toughest cloud job to land is your first; it’s hard to demonstrate skills without professional experience.</p><p>For the past few months, I’ve been helping hundreds of cloud newbies get certified, interviewed, and hired through the <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/news/introducing-the-cloudguruchallenge">#CloudGuruChallenge</a>. And one of the most common questions I get is: <em>how many certifications should I earn before applying for jobs</em>?</p><h3>“How many certs” is the wrong question</h3><p>Let’s get real about certs for a minute. I’ve yet to meet a hiring manager who believes that IT certifications guarantee technical ability. (And let’s be honest, you wouldn’t want to work for someone who believed that.) A cert is just a piece of paper, after all — and that’s only if you print out the PDF. It doesn’t magically give you the experience you need to succeed in the real world.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1616" height="894" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png 1616w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-78.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px"></figure><p>And yet, cloud certification has been helpful in my engineering career, and I encourage it for everyone looking to get a foothold in the industry. Certs are powerful tools, as long as you understand what they are and are not good for.</p><h3>When do cloud certs help?</h3><p><strong>Certs give you a comprehensive knowledge base</strong>. You may not have a traditional computer science degree. But if you work through the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification, you will get exposed to the core AWS services and architecture patterns that industry professionals use. You won’t have to worry that you missed big topic areas in your job prep. The cert puts it all in one place. Very convenient. In this sense, it almost doesn’t matter whether or not you ever sit the cert exam! Just studying the material gives you the real value.</p><p><strong>Certs help you get interviews.</strong> When a recruiter is reading through your resume, a cloud certification does stand out. It says you’re serious about the field and that there is some external validation of that — especially if you are missing a traditional credential like a college degree in computer science. The cert’s not going to get you the job, but it might get your foot in the door for the interview.</p><p><strong>For one very particular type of job, certifications are a big advantage</strong>. Professional services companies like consulting shops and MSPs are among the biggest employers of cloud-certified people (and some of the <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/business/partner-story-accenture">biggest customers of A Cloud Guru</a>!) That’s because certs are very valuable in the consulting world:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Certification counts help the consulting companies maintain important partnerships with cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft. More people with certs add up to higher partnership tiers and better benefits.</li><li>Certs help communicate expertise to the consultants’ clients. If I’m hiring an outside consultant, I want to see credentials!</li><li>They are required for certain types of consulting engagements (for example, AWS only allows certified Solutions Architect Professionals to officially conduct an <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-well-architected-framework?_ga=2.15607222.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">AWS Well-Architected Review</a>).</li></ul><p>Big consultancies have a bottomless appetite for cloud-certified professionals … assuming you actually know what the cert says you know, of course! So you really open up your job options by getting certified.</p><h3>But really, how many certs should I get before applying for cloud jobs?</h3><p>While in one sense, more certs are always better (I’ve never *not* been impressed by someone who holds all 12 AWS certifications — that’s an impressive achievement by any definition), you do reach a point where you need to focus on building other skills. Otherwise, you run the risk of appearing like you are all head knowledge and no practical ability.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1844" height="1674" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png 1844w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/10/Untitled_Artwork-77-1.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1844px) 100vw, 1844px"></figure><p>If you are brand-new to cloud, I recommend the following steps:</p><h4>1. <strong>Pick a cloud</strong></h4><p>Focus your energy on getting familiar with one cloud provider, rather than going a mile wide and an inch deep on multiple clouds you don’t have professional experience with. I recommend starting with <a href="https://acloudguru.com/aws-cloud-training">AWS</a> or <a href="https://acloudguru.com/azure-cloud-training">Azure</a>, one of the two market leaders.</p><h4><strong>2. Get a foundational associate-level technical certification</strong></h4><p>I’m not talking about the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Azure’s AZ-900; those introductory certs are great, but they won’t communicate technical chops for an engineering role. I’d suggest getting the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate?_ga=2.110608773.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">AWS Solutions Architect Associate</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/160303d7-6947-4fbc-9d19-fa304849f92e?_ga=2.1508785.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">Microsoft Azure Administrator certification</a>, then moving onto the next steps in this guide *while you continue to pursue a specialty certification in your area of cloud interest*.&nbsp;</p><h4>3. <strong>Build a portfolio to get hands-on with the basics</strong></h4><p>Cloud is the latest in a long line of IT paradigms. But though it’s highly in demand, “cloud” isn’t exactly a skill on its own. Hiring managers are going to want to see that you have knowledge in several foundational areas.&nbsp;</p><p>I suggest building <strong>2-3 portfolio projects</strong> that demonstrate your grasp of the following key skills, then publishing them on GitHub:</p><h5><strong>Code</strong></h5><p>You must be able to write basic scripts. I recommend <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/df3778be-ba58-4be7-a232-aa658bed7517?_ga=2.111381508.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">Python</a> as a programming language to learn — it’s used on cloud teams the world over. You don’t need to be a rock star at algorithms and data structures, but you should know how to <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/a0abe7d4-ce82-4dfe-beb9-21d98f4c6941?_ga=2.102549889.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">manipulate data objects</a> and interact with cloud services. Try this <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-python-aws-etl">free #CloudGuruChallenge</a> for a Python portfolio project that demonstrates real-world skills.</p><h5><strong>Networking</strong></h5><p>You will be expected to have solid familiarity with <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/d024d8c2-e326-488d-be29-577064e57829?_ga=2.15712566.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">how the internet works</a>. <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/2c3ff8e6-59e4-4e89-8b66-f82a507647ab?_ga=2.14541111.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">DNS</a>, TCP/IP, and certificates — these protocols will rule your life in the cloud, where everything is made up of services talking to each other over a network. A Cloud Guru has some great <a href="https://learn.acloud.guru/handson/934b78e6-5327-4ed3-a369-1b60b382722f">Hands-On Labs</a> to help you get a feel here.</p><h5>Linux</h5><p>Linux is just as relevant in the cloud as it was in old-school sysadmin jobs. Know how to <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/91c2746a-dfb4-46bb-98a3-a526efd0477b?_ga=2.169854497.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">navigate the Linux filesystem</a>, <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/85a18eac-0e55-419e-a416-301beed637e6?_ga=2.175040674.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">use Vim</a> and terminal commands, and a bit about <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/108f9d35-6966-4fb6-a6cd-7af135329bba?_ga=2.169854497.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">containerization</a>.</p><h4>4. Apply, while continuing to learn</h4><p>At this point, I would say go ahead and start applying for associate-level cloud support and engineering roles. You should continue to improve your skills and level up your resume during this process by studying for a professional- or specialty-level certification like the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional?_ga=2.82636310.1040396949.1601913549-415638573.1596472192">AWS Solutions Architect Professional cert</a> I mentioned above.

      <p>Replace your period app in 5 minutes, and own your most sensitive
        data. It's tracking without the tracking.</p>

      <img alt="screenshot of period tracking app" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/app-screenshot.png">
      <p>This post will guide you through setting up your own Google Sheets-based period tracker (with all the features
        of your "favorite" app). You'll be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easily record period days, flow and any symptoms</li>
        <li>See past period dates and trends</li>
        <li>Anticipate upcoming periods and fertile days</li>
        <li>Get email alerts (for you, or anyone else)</li>
        <li>See past and future periods / fertile days on your Google Calendar</li>
        <li><strong>Own and access your raw data</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Customize the tracker in any way you'd like</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can do a <a href="#quick">quick set-up in 5 minutes</a>, and then optionally spend another 10 setting up <a href="#email-calendar">email and calendar
          integrations</a>. And because it's a spreadsheet, all the formulas are there, so you can <a href="#customization">customize this to your heart's content</a>.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://www.recurse.com/still-computing/issue-3">Read more about why I made this here</a>. TLDR: I was frustrated with iPhone period apps and
        wanted to own my own period data.</p>
      <p>Note: This assumes that you have a Google account. If you don't, or if you don't want this data in
        your Google account, you
        should be able to get this working in Excel or other spreadsheet software with a few modifications, but you will not have the form, email and calendar integration.</p>

      <h2 id="quick">ðŸ”´ Five Minute Set Up</h2>
      <h3>1. Copy The Sheet</h3>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vCP4HJGB8fZFG0ZlvbeWVikga7mxQGlSkRI9VDO8M3o/edit#gid=1213408420">Make
          a copy of this Google Sheet</a>. Rename your copy anything you'd like. (i.e. My top secret menstrual tracking
        device, period stuff, There will be blood, whatevvv.) Only you will be able to see this copy.</p>
      <img alt="how to make a copy" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-1-make-copy.gif">
      <p>You should now see two files in your <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive">Google Drive</a>. The
        sheet you copied, and a Google Form to submit to it. Rename the form if you'd like.</p>
      <img alt="rename form" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-1-rename-form.gif">
      <p>Open your copy of the tracker. (Make sure it's your copy, otherwise you won't be able to edit it.) You'll see a
        lot of #NUM! formula errors. To make those go away, and bring the app to life...</p>
      <img alt="sheet with errors" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-1-errors-on-sheet.png">
      <h3>2. Enter your last 2 cycles/months of period data</h3>
      <p>The tracker will start working when it has at least <strong>2 months</strong> worth of periods, as that will
        allow the tracker estimate a cycle length. If you're not sure of the exact dates, estimating is fine to start
        off. Make 1 entry for each day of your period.</p>

      <p>You can enter your past data in two ways:</p>
      <div>
        <p><strong>OPTION ONE: Directly enter data in the sheet (faster)</strong></p>
        <p>This is an option if you're more comfortable with spreadsheets, as you'll be editing raw data. Go to the
          <strong>data_by_date</strong> sheet and directly enter the heaviness of your period for each day you had it in
          the <strong>level</strong> column. 1=light, 2=medium, 3=heavy. You can also just enter all of one number if
          you don't know/care to track heaviness. If you want more than a 3-point scale, feel free to do something
          else... you'll just need to adjust the automatic conditional formatting for colors.
        </p>
        <p><img alt="manually enter data" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-2-enter-data.gif"></p><p><strong>OPTION TWO: Enter data via your Google Form (slower, potentially less error-prone)</strong></p>
        <p>Go to the Google Form in your Drive, then click on the little eye that says "Preview." You will need to fill
          out the form once for EACH day of your period that you want to record.</p>
        <p><img alt="use form to submit your data" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-2-form-submission.gif">


      </p></div>

      <h3>3. Cool, that's it. Keep tracking and explore your data <br><span>...and add additional integrations below,
          if you'd like.</span></h3>
      <p>It's simple to keep tracking: Whenever you have your period, make an entry each day, either in the form or
        directly into the sheet. This will keep your data and predictions up-to-date.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Summary</strong> tab of the tracker sheet will be your hub of information on periods past and
        present. Don't directly edit data in this sheet: it is all read in via other sheets.</p>

      <img alt="sheet with data" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-3-with-data.png">


      <p>The top section will give you an English-language overview of what's currently going on in your cycle, as well
        as when you can expect your next period and fertile period.</p>
      <p>Further down, you can see data on your past cycles,
        and small bar charts to give you a quick overview of your cycle trends. You can see the dates for projected
        periods / fertility, and use those as you'd like. I make no claims, medical or otherwise, that predictions will
        be accurate,
        but it has been useful for me.</p>
      <p>The charts to the right that currently say 'No data' will start to populate once you've entered a few more
        periods. They'll show you trend lines on period duration and cycle length.</p>


      <p>For future easy access, you may want to bookmark the tracker sheet and form on your phone and/or computer. For
        example, I made homescreen shortcuts on my iPhone for the form and the summary. (Yes, that's my phone
        background.)</p>
      <img alt="shortcuts on my phone" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-3-shortcuts.jpg">

      <h2 id="email-calendar">ðŸ”´ Add Optional Email &amp; Calendar Integration</h2>
      <p>These steps are more complicated than the quick set-up. If you are familiar with JavaScript and Google Apps
        Scripts, you may find this less mysterious, and will also be able to make modifications you're interested in.
        That said, you don't need to know anything about coding to do it: just follow these directions exactly.</p>
      <h3>1. Configure Email Alerts</h3>
      <p>You can set up the tracker to email you (and anyone you'd like! friends, lovers, etc.) when your period and
        fertility are probably coming.</p>
      <p>Go to the <strong>email_calendar_config</strong> sheet and enter your email address, and the emails of anyone
        else. Add your name (as this will get slotted into the email), and the number of days ahead of your period or
        fertility that you'd like to receive an alert.</p>
      <img alt="set up email addresses" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-4-emails.gif">

      <p>The email integration is powered by an Apps Script. To access the script, click on <strong>Tools &gt; Script
          Editor</strong>. </p>
      <img alt="go to script editor" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-4-go-to-script-editor.gif">

      <p>Try to run the script. You might see an error the first time. Run it again, and then you'll be asked to approve
        permissions. The warnings are ominous, but you are only approving permissions for this local copy of the
        JavaScript functions you see to run--that means that nobody else can control the script (including me). Any
        edits you make to this file will only affect you, and not other users of this tracker. That said, if you aren't
        comfortable assessing the JavaScript here to see if you think it's safe, feel free to not proceed. (You'll have
        full app functionality without email and calendar).</p>

      <img alt="approve permissions" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-4-permissions.gif">


      <p>Unless today happens to be exactly the number of days before your period that you set, nothing will happen. But
        if the script doesn't error, you can move to the next step, which is to set a trigger for this to run. Click
        <strong>Edit &gt; Current project's triggers</strong>. Add a daily, time-based trigger for this email. This means
        the tracker will check each day whether it is X days before your period/fertility, and if it is, will email you.
      </p>
      <img alt="set up triggers" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-4-triggers.gif">

      <p>You (and your pals, if you included them) will then receive an email like this each month when it is X days
        ahead of your period or fertility. You can edit the text and subject line in the Script Editor if you'd like.
      </p>
      <img alt="your email" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-4-period-email-receipt.png">

      <h3>2. Configure Google Calendar integration</h3>
      <p>If you run your life out of your Google Calendar (I know I do), why not also just see your period history and
        projections there? To do this, first you must create a NEW Google Calendar. (The integration could delete events
        in your existing calendar, so do NOT use an existing calendar.) <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings/createcalendar">Create a new one here</a>.</p>
      <img alt="create a new calendar" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-5-create-calendar.gif">

      <p>After you create your calendar, get the calendar ID and paste it into the correct cell in the
        <strong>email_calendar_config</strong> sheet.</p>
      <img alt="get calendar ID" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-5-get-calendar-id.gif">

      <p>Run the <strong>UpdateCalendar</strong> function once to create events on your new calendar. If you did not
        approve permissions for the app in the email step, you may need to do that again now.</p>
      <img alt="get calendar ID" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-5-update-calendar-once.png">

      <p>Create a new trigger to run the <strong>UpdateCalendar</strong> function whenever you submit the form to enter
        more data. If you won't be using the form, you may want to make the trigger "on edit" for the spreadsheet. You
        may need to approve permissions again.</p>
      <img alt="set up calendar trigger" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-5-calendar-trigger.gif">

      <p> You will then see past periods and projected periods on your calendar, and it will update when you submit new
        period data each month.</p>
      <img alt="calendar example" src="https://www.alizaaufrichtig.com/static/images/step-5-period-calendar.png">
      <h2 id="customization">ðŸ”´ Further Customization</h2>
      <p>The best thing about using sheets is that all the data and formulas are completely visible to you. So if you
        are able and so inclined, you can do whatever you want with the data. Some ideas and customizations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the rating scale of period flow to something besides 1-3</li>
        <li>Create additional analysis and charts</li>
        <li>Track anything else on a daily basis and view it summarized</li>
        <li>Change fertility projections if you don't like the defaults</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make something cool? I'd love to know.</p>

October 7, 2020 | https://alexgolec.dev/google-interview-questions-deconstructed-the-knights-dialer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alexgolec.dev/google-interview-questions-deconstructed-the-knights-dialer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This is the second in a series of posts in which I share my advice for candidates interviewing for tech companies, drawing on my experience as an engineer and interviewer at Google. If you haven’t already, take a look at the <a href="https://alexgolec.dev/introducing-google-interview-questions-deconstructed/">introduction</a> to this series.</p><p><em>Before I start, a disclaimer: while interviewing candidates is one of my professional responsibilities, this blog represents my personal observations, my personal anecdotes, and my personal opinions. Please don’t mistake this for any sort of official statement by or about Google, Alphabet, or any other person or organization.</em></p><p>This was the first problem I used during my interviewing career, and it was also the first to leak and get banned. I like it because it hits number of sweet spots:</p><ul><li>It’s easy to state and understand.</li><li>It has a number of solutions, each requiring varying degrees of algorithms and data structures knowledge. Also, a little bit of insight goes a long way.</li><li>Each solution can be implemented in relatively few lines, making it perfect for a time-constrained environment.</li></ul><p>If you’re a student or otherwise applying to tech jobs, my hope is that you’ll come away from reading this with a better understanding of what to expect from interview problems. If you’re an interviewer, I’d like to share my thought process and stylistic approach to interviewing, the better to inform others and solicit comments.</p><p>Note I’ll be writing code in Python. I like Python because it’s easy to learn, compact, and has an absolutely massive standard library. Candidates like it, too: even though we impose no language constraints, 90% of people I interview use Python. Also I use Python 3 because c’mon, it’s 2018.</p><p><em>Join <a href="https://discord.gg/cKFppJ">our Discord</a> to discuss this problem with the author and the community! </em></p><p>Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally then two vertically:</p><figure><img src="https://alexgolec.dev/content/images/2020/08/1-pE4b3hqGDv7pKivQTQZyPw.png" alt="Image for post"><figcaption>Pay no attention to the poorly-redacted star and pound keys</figcaption></figure><p>Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.</p><p>How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular starting position?</p><p>Every interview I conduct basically breaks down into two parts: first we find an algorithmic solution and then the candidate implements it in code. I say “we” find a solution because I’m not a mute spectator: 45 minutes is not a lot of time to design and implement anything under the best circumstances, never mind under pressure. I let candidates take the lead in the discussion, generating ideas, solving instances of the problem, etc., but I’m more than happy to give a nudge in the right direction. The better the candidate, the fewer hints I tend to have to give, but I have yet to see a candidate who required no input from me at all.</p><p>I should underscore this, because it’s important: as an interviewer, I’m not in the business of sitting back and watching people fail. I want to write as much positive feedback as I can, and I try to give you opportunities to allow me to write good things about you. Hints are my way of saying “okay, I’m gonna give this bit to you, but only so you can move on and show me what you’ve got on the other parts of the question.”</p><p>With that being said, your first action after hearing the question should be stepping up to the whiteboard and solving small instances of the problem by hand. <em>Never dive right into code!</em> Solving small instances lets you spot patterns, observed and edge cases, and also helps crystallize a solution in your head. As an example, suppose you start on 6 and have two hops to make. Your sequences will be…</p><ul><li>6–1–8</li><li>6–1–6</li><li>6–7–2</li><li>6–7–6</li><li>6–0–4</li><li>6–0–6</li></ul><p>…for a total of six sequences. If you’re following along, try taking a pencil and paper and deriving these. This doesn’t translate well into a blog post, but trust me when I say there’s something magical about working out a problem by hand that leads to many more insights than just staring at it and thinking quietly.</p><p>With all that said, you may have a solution forming in your head. But before we get there…</p><p>One of the surprises I had when I started using this problem is how often candidates get stuck on computing the keys to which we can hop from a given position, also known as the neighbors. My advice is: when in doubt, write an empty placeholder and ask the interviewer if you can implement it later. This problem’s complexity does not lie in the neighbor computation; I’m paying attention to how well you count full numbers. Any time spent on neighbor computation is effectively wasted.</p><p>I would accept “let’s assume there’s a function that gives me the neighbors” along with the following stub. Of course, I’ll probably ask you to double back and implement this later, but only if we have time. You can simply write a stub like this and move on:</p><pre><code>def neighbors(position):
	...</code></pre><p>Also, you don’t really lose much by asking to use a stub: if the question’s complexity is elsewhere I’ll allow it. If not, I’ll ask you to actually implement it. I don’t mind when candidates don’t realize where the complexity of a question lies, especially in the early stages when they might not have fully explored the problem.</p><p>As for the neighbors function here, given that it never changes you can simply create a map and return the appropriate value:</p><pre><code>NEIGHBORS_MAP = {
    1: (6, 8),
    2: (7, 9),
    3: (4, 8),
    4: (3, 9, 0),
    5: tuple(),  # 5 has no neighbors
    6: (1, 7, 0),
    7: (2, 6),
    8: (1, 3),
    9: (2, 4),
    0: (4, 6),
}
def neighbors(position):
    return NEIGHBORS_MAP[position]</code></pre><p>Anyway, on to the solution. Perhaps you’ve already noticed this problem can be solved by enumerating all possible numbers and counting them. You can use recursion to generate these values:</p><pre><code>def yield_sequences(starting_position, num_hops, sequence=None):
    if sequence is None:
        sequence = [starting_position]
    
    if num_hops == 0:
        yield sequence
        return

    for neighbor in neighbors(starting_position):
        yield from yield_sequences(
            neighbor, num_hops - 1, sequence + [neighbor])

def count_sequences(starting_position, num_hops):
    num_sequences = 0
    for sequence in yield_sequences(starting_position, num_hops):
        num_sequences += 1
    return num_sequences</code></pre><p>This works, and it’s a common starting point I saw in interviews. Notice, however, that we generate the numbers and never actually use them. This problem asks for the <em>count</em> of numbers, not the numbers themselves. Once we count a number we never revisit it. As a general rule of thumb, I recommend paying attention to when your solution computes something it doesn’t use. Often you can cut it out and get a better solution. Let’s do that now.</p><p>How can we count phone numbers without generating them? It can be done, but not without an additional insight. Notice how the count of numbers that can be generated from a given starting position in N hops is equal to the sum of the counts of hops that can be generated starting from each of its neighbors in N-1 hops. Stated mathematically as a recurrence relation, it looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://alexgolec.dev/content/images/2020/08/1-mcwSdrDe69X5FDegPmfgHg.png" alt="Image for post"></figure><p>This is intuitively obvious when you consider what happens with one hop: 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, and 0) and in zero hops you can reach one number for each, so you can only dial three numbers.</p><p>How does one arrive at this insight, you might ask? If you’ve studied recursion, this should become evident after some exploration on the whiteboard. Many candidates who’ve practiced recursion immediately notice this problem breaks down into smaller subproblems, which is a dead giveaway. If you’re in an interview with me and you can’t seem to arrive at this insight, I will usually give hints to help get you there, up to and including outright giving it away if prodding fails.</p><p>Once you have this insight in hand, you can already move forward and solve this problem again. There are a number of implementations that use this fact, but let’s start with the one I see most often in interviews: the naive recursive approach:</p><pre><code>from neighbors import neighbors                                 
                                                                
def count_sequences(start_position, num_hops):                  
    if num_hops == 0:                                           
        return 1                                                
                                                                
    num_sequences = 0                                           
    for position in neighbors(start_position):                  
        num_sequences += count_sequences(position, num_hops - 1)
    return num_sequences                                        
                                                                
if __name__ == '__main__':

</span></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time we added support for
<code>let</code> expressions. This time we’re going to compile <code>if</code> expressions.</p>

<p>Compiling <code>if</code> expressions will allow us to write code that performs decision
making. For example, we can write code that does something based on the result
of some imaginary function <code>coin-flip</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>coin-flip</span><span>)</span> <span>heads</span><span>)</span>
    <span>123</span>
    <span>456</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the call to <code>coin-flip</code> returns <code>heads</code>, then this whole if-expression will
evaluate to <code>123</code>. Otherwise, it will evaluate to <code>456</code>. To determine if an
expression is truthy, we’ll check if it is not equal to <code>#f</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the iftrue and iffalse expressions (<em>consequent</em> and <em>alternate</em>,
respectively) are only evaluated if their branch is reached.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-strategy">Implementation strategy</h3>

<p>People normally compile <code>if</code> expressions by taking the following structure in
Lisp:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>condition</span>
    <span>consequent</span>
    <span>alternate</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and rewriting it to the following pseudo-assembly (where <code>...compile(X)</code> is
replaced with compiled code from the expressions):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  ...compile(condition)
  compare result, #f
  jump-if-equal alternate
  ...compile(consequent)
  jump end
alternate:
  ...compile(alternate)
end:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will evaluate the <code>condition</code> expression. If it’s falsey, jump to the code
for the <code>alternate</code> expression. Otherwise, continue on to the code for the
<code>consequent</code> expression. So that the program does not also execute the code for
the <code>alternate</code>, jump over it.</p>

<p>This transformation requires a couple of new pieces of infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-infrastructure">Implementation infrastructure</h3>

<p>First, we’ll need two types of jump instructions! We have a conditional jump
(<code>jcc</code> in x86-64) and an unconditional jump (<code>jmp</code> in x86-64). These are
relatively straightforward to emit.</p>

<p>Somewhat more complicated are the <em>targets</em> of those jump instructions. We’ll
need to supply each of the instructions with some sort of destination code
address.</p>

<p>When emitting text assembly, this is not so hard: make up names for your labels
(as with <code>alternate</code> and <code>end</code> above), and keep the names consistent between
the jump instruction and the jump target. Sure, you need to generate <em>unique</em>
labels, but the assembler will at least do address resolution for you. This
address resolution transparently handles backward jumps (where the label is
already known) and forward jumps (where the label comes after the jump
instruction).</p>

<p>Since we’re not emitting text assembly, we’ll need to calculate both forward
and backward jump offsets by hand. This ends up not being so bad in practice
once we come up with an ergonomic way to do it. Let’s take a look at some
production-grade assemblers for inspiration.</p>

<h3 id="how-big-kid-compilers-do-this">How Big Kid compilers do this</h3>

<p>I read some source code for assemblers like the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/2707880f1b486f2a2f87d7e2de7baea12c6ca362/runtime/vm/compiler/assembler/assembler_base.h]">Dart
assembler</a>. Dart is a language runtime developed by Google and
part of their infrastructure includes a Just-In-Time compiler, sort of like
what we’re making here. Part of their assembler is some slick C++-y RAII
infrastucture for emitting code and doing cleanup. Their implementation of
compiling <code>if</code> expressions might look something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Made-up APIs to make the Dart code look like our code</span>
<span>int</span> <span>Compile_if</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cond</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>consequent</span><span>,</span>

   <span>buf</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>cmp</span><span>(</span><span>kRax</span><span>,</span> <span>Object</span><span>::</span><span>false</span><span>());</span>
   <span>buf</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>jcc</span><span>(</span><span>kEqual</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>alternate</span><span>);</span>
   <span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>consequent</span><span>);</span>
   <span>buf</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>jmp</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>end</span><span>);</span>
   <span>buf</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>alternate</span><span>);</span>
   <span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>alternate</span><span>);</span>
   <span>buf</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>bind</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>end</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Their <code>Label</code> objects store information about where in the emitted machine code
they are bound with <code>bind</code>. If they are bound before they are used by <code>jcc</code> or
<code>jmp</code> or something, then the emitter will just emit the destination address. If
they are <em>not</em> yet bound, however, then the <code>Label</code> will keep track of where it
has to go back and patch the machine code once the label is bound to a
location.</p>

<p>When the labels are destructed — meaning they can no longer be referenced by
C++ code — their destructors have code to go back and patch all the
instructions that referenced the label before it was bound.</p>

<p>While x86-64 has multiple jump widths available (for speed, I guess), it is a
little tricky to use them for forward jumps. Because we don’t know in advance
how long the intermediate code will be, we’ll just stick to generating 32-bit
relative jumps <em>always</em>.</p>

<p>Virtual Machines like ART, <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/3e0dc6888329b3b4ba9cc357a01a775044f1cb3c/src/hotspot/share/asm/assembler.hpp">OpenJDK Hotspot</a>,

didn’t link an implementation, it’s either because I found the it too
complicated to reproduce or couldn’t quickly track it down. Or maybe I don’t
know about it!</p>

<p>Basically what I am trying to tell you is that this bind-and-backpatch approach
is tried and tested and that we’re going to implement it in C. I hope you
enjoyed the whirlwind tour of assemblers in various other runtimes along the
way.</p>

<h3 id="compiling-if-expressions-finally">Compiling <code>if</code>-expressions, finally</h3>

<p>Alright, so we finally get the big idea about how to do this transformation.
Let’s put it into practice.</p>

<p>First, as with <code>let</code>, we’re going to need to handle the <code>if</code> case in
<code>Compile_call</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>
                 <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>Env</span> <span>*</span><span>varenv</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"if"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>Compile_if</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*condition=*/</span><span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
                        <span>/*consequent=*/</span><span>operand2</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span>
                        <span>/*alternate=*/</span><span>operand3</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>),</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>,</span> <span>varenv</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As usual, we’ll pull apart the expression so <code>Compile_if</code> has less work to do.
Since we now have more than two operands (!), I’ve added <code>operand3</code>. It works
just like you would think it does.</p>

<p>For <code>Compile_if</code>, we’re going to largely replicate the pseudocode C++ from
above. I think you’ll find that if you squint it looks similar enough.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_if</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>cond</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>consequent</span><span>,</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instead of having a <code>Label</code> struct, though, I opted to just have a function to
backpatch forward jumps explicitly. If you prefer to port <code>Label</code> to C, be my
guest. I found it very finicky<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Also, instead of <code>bind</code>, I opted for a more explicit <code>backpatch</code>. This makes it
clearer what is happening, I think.</p>

<p>This explicit backpatch approach requires manually tracking the offsets (like
<code>alternate_pos</code> and <code>end_pos</code>) inside the jump instructions. We’ll need those
offsets to backpatch them later. This means functions like <code>Emit_jcc</code> and
<code>Emit_jmp</code> should return the offsets inside <code>buf</code> where they write placeholder
offsets.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look inside these helper functions’ internals.</p>

<h3 id="jcc-and-jmp-implementations"><code>jcc</code> and <code>jmp</code> implementations</h3>

<p>The implementations for <code>jcc</code> and <code>jmp</code> are pretty similar, so I will only
reproduce <code>jcc</code> here.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>word</span> <span>Emit_jcc</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>Condition</span> <span>cond</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>offset</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0x0f</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write8</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>0x80</span> <span>+</span> <span>cond</span><span>);</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Buffer_len</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_write32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>disp32</span><span>(</span><span>offset</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>pos</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function is like many other <code>Emit</code> functions except for its return value.
It returns the start location of the 32-bit offset for use in patching forward
jumps. In the case of backward jumps, we can ignore this, since there’s no need
to patch it after-the-fact.</p>

<h3 id="backpatching-implementation">Backpatching implementation</h3>

<p>Here is the implementation of <code>Emit_backpatch_imm32</code>. I’ll walk through it and
explain.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>Emit_backpatch_imm32</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>int32_t</span> <span>target_pos</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>current_pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Buffer_len</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>);</span>
  <span>word</span> <span>relative_pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>current_pos</span> <span>-</span> <span>target_pos</span> <span>-</span> <span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>int32_t</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Buffer_at_put32</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>target_pos</span><span>,</span> <span>disp32</span><span>(</span><span>relative_pos</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The input <code>target_pos</code> is the location inside the <code>jmp</code> (or similar)
instruction that needs to be patched. Since we need to patch it with a
<em>relative</em> offset, we compute the distance between the current position and the
target position. We also need to subtract 4 bytes (<code>sizeof(int32_t)</code>) because
the jump offset is relative to the <em>end</em> of the <code>jmp</code> instruction (the
beginning of the next instruction).</p>

<p>Then, we write that value in. <code>Buffer_at_put32</code> and <code>disp32</code> are similar to
their 8-bit equivalents.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have implemented <code>if</code>.</p>

<h3 id="a-fun-diagram">A fun diagram</h3>

<p>Radare2 has a tool called <a href="https://cutter.re/">Cutter</a> for reverse engineering
and binary analysis. I decided to use it on the compiled output of a function
containing an <code>if</code> expression. It produced this pretty graph!</p>

  <img src="https://bernsteinbear.com/assets/img/lisp/callgraph.svg">

</figure>

<p>It’s prettier in the tool, trust me.</p>

<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>

<p>I added two trivial tests for the condition being true and the condition being
false. I also added a nested if case as a smoke test but I did not foresee that
being troublesome with our handy recursive approach.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Microsoft 💔 Linux</h3>
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>In 2001, Microsoft's former CEO— Steve Ballmer— was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">quoted</a> by the online tech news publication, <em>The Register</em>, saying:</p>
              <p>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches</p>
              <p>Fast-forward 15 years into the future— at Microsoft's developer conference, <em>Build 2016</em>— and Gates' tech behemoth reveals a sudden volte-face. The current CEO, Satya Nadella, announces Windows Subsystem for Linux. With WSL, Microsoft is taking some of the most popular Linux distributions and making them available within Windows through the Microsoft Store.</p>
              <p>According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system">W<sup>3</sup>Techs survey</a>, Unix operating systems (the under-pinning OS of Linux, as well as MacOS) make up 71% of the Web, the remaining 29% being Windows. Additionally, every Android phone, tablet and smart TV runs on a modified version of the Linux kernel. So, I guess if you can't beat 'em, join 'em?</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wsl2/w3techs_webservers.jpg">
              <p><img alt="W3Techs Survey on Web OS's, Unix: 71%, Windows: 29%" data-src="assets/img/wsl2/w3techs_webservers.jpg" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wsl2/w3techs_webservers.jpg">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Whether or not its because of Microsoft's good graces or some ulterior motive, I know having an easily accessible Unix-type environment available on Windows has been a godsend for me and for so many other developers.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>What's so great about WSL?</h3>
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>Before WSL, developers running Windows had two options: 1) a virtual machine (VM), or 2) dual-booting. Running a virtual machine uses up more resources than WSL. It can also be difficult to integrate hardware and files between the host machine and the VM. Dual-booting allows for a full-fledged install on a separate disk partition; but it requires a restart any time you want to switch between OS's.</p>
              <p>Windows Subsystem on Linux doesn't integrate with the host's hardware perfectly— for example, NVIDIA is still working on <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl">CUDA drivers</a> that will take advantage of GPU resources from within WSL. However, for Linux developers who are frequently running CAD software or Adobe Suite (which are <a target="_blank" href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?iId=17&amp;sClass=application">difficult-to-impossible</a> to install on Linux), WSL can be a fantastic partner.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>WSL1 vs WSL2</h3>
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>More recently, Microsoft announced WSL2— an update that allows for a more complete Linux kernel to run on a Windows machine. This made it much easier to install a variety of software that had been difficult to run on the previous, WSL1. WSL2 is very similar to running a virtual machine (in fact it uses Microsoft's hyperV virtual machines).</p>
              <p>However, using WSL2 (as opposed to installing a Linux distro through VirtualBox, or another VM manager) provides some minor performance benefits since Microsoft has optimized it to integrate with Windows' services. If you want, I recommend reading Microsoft's own WSL1-vs-WSL2 <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions">feature comparison</a> docs.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Alright, so how do I install WSL2?</h3>
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>Microsoft has clean, straight-forward <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">installation documentation</a> for WSL and WSL2. You can refer to that tutorial if you get stuck, or just follow the steps outlined below. Before starting, make sure you update your Windows 10 installation with the most recent build.</p>
              <p>I'll also be going one-step further, and showing you how to run a Linux GUI using WSL2 and VcXsrv (display forwarding). If you're more of a visual-learner, I've also included an installation speedrun <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtXIzVM5wZE">video</a> that follows the same steps outlined below (<em>edit: I forgot step 11 in the video, and it's a critical one! Make sure you do that!</em>).</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>1. Enable WSL Feature</b></p>
              <p>First you need to enable the Windows Subsystem on Linux feature by right-clicking on Powershell from the start menu and clicking "Run as Administrator".</p>
              <p>Then, paste the following command and hit "Enter"— don't close the Powershell!</p>
              <pre><code>dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>2. Enable WSL2 Virtual Machine Feature</b></p>
              <p>After the last command is finished, paste the following command in the same Administrator-level shell, and hit "Enter" to enable the WSL2 VM. Again, keep this shell open.</p>
              <pre><code>dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>3. Download and Install the WSL2 Linux Kernel Update</b></p>
              <p>Click <a target="_blank" href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi">here</a> to download the Microsoft executable for installing the WSL2 Linux Kernel update. Once it's finished downloading, double-click the executable and follow the installation steps. This part's pretty straightforward</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>4. Set WSL2 as Default Version</b></p>
              <p>Copy and paste the following command in Powershell to set WSL2 to be the default version:</p>
              <pre><code>wsl --set-default-version 2</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>5. Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the Microsoft Store</b></p>
              <p>Click the start menu and open the Microsoft Store. Search for "Ubuntu 20.04" and install this Linux distro. If you want to use another distro, that's fine; but Ubuntu 20.04 is compatible with the Regolith Linux desktop GUI we'll be installing in just a bit.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>6. Ubuntu 20.04 Initial Setup</b></p>
              <p>Once Ubuntu is done installing, click "Launch" to initiate first-time installation setup. You'll be prompted to put in a username and password.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>7. Make sure You're Using WSL2</b></p>
              <p>At this point, it might be a good idea to double-check that WSL is using version 2 by default. Open a command prompt (or use Powershell if it's still open) to paste in the following command:</p>
              <pre><code>wsl --list --verbose</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>8. Download and Install VcXsrv</b></p>
              <p>VcXsrv is an X Server that we'll use to view the GUI from WSL2.</p>
              <p>There are a few other display-forwarding servers available (like <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/">Xming</a>), but I've found VcXsrv works the best. Download the executable <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">here</a> and click through the installation steps.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>9. Install Regolith Desktop</b></p>
              <p>I have <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/regolith">Regolith Desktop</a> installed on one of my PCs, and it's fantastic. It's preconfigured to use the i3 window manager which I find incredibly efficient for its tiling and hotkey features.</p>
              <p>A <em>loosed</em> reader, Rodrigo, asked me use Regolith for the tutorial; but if you want to install a different GUI you can! To install Regolith Desktop, open your fresh Ubuntu install, and paste in the following lines:</p>
              <pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release</code></pre>
              <pre><code>sudo apt install regolith-desktop i3xrocks-net-traffic i3xrocks-cpu-usage i3xrocks-time</code></pre>
              <p>It's a lot of packages, so it'll take some time.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>10. Change the "Mod" Key</b></p>
              <p>Regolith, or rather i3-wm, uses the Super (Windows) key as the hotkey prefix by default. Since you're running this GUI within Windows, you'll run into a lot of overlap between Windows' and i3-wm's preconfigured shortcuts.</p>
              <p>For this reason, I recommend swapping the Super key for the Alt key. To  change the Mod key mapping use the Vim or Nano text editors to open the configuration file located at:</p>
              <pre><code>vim /etc/regolith/i3/config</code></pre>
              <p>On line 42 and 43, you'll find the Mod key assignment. Switch "Mod1" and "Mod4" and you'll be good to go! Your edited lines should look like this:</p>
              <pre><code>set_from_resource $mod i3-wm.mod Mod1</code></pre>
              <pre><code>set_from_resource $alt i3-wm.alt Mod4</code></pre>
              <p>If you're using Vim, hit "Escape" and type ":wq", then hit "Enter" to write and quit the file. You can check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://regolith-linux.org/regolith-site-r13/docs/howto/super-to-alt/">official Regolith tutorial</a> on making these changes if you get stuck.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>11. Export DISPLAY parameter</b></p>
              <p>Another critical edit (that I forgot to put in the video— oops 🙃) is to export the DISPLAY variable. Since WSL2 is a VM, it has it's own IP address (which can change at each startup). As a result, you'll need to add a couple lines to your bash profile for VcXsrv to connect to WSL2.</p>
              <p>To open your ".bashrc" with Vim:</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <pre><code>vim ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
              <p>Press and hold Shift then press "G" to jump to the bottom of the file. On two new lines, paste in the following code:</p> 
              <pre><code>export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2&gt;/dev/null):0<br>export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1</code></pre>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b>12. Open and Configure VcXsrv</b></p>
              <p>Click the start menu and type in "Xlaunch" then hit "Enter" to run VcXsrv. Click the "One window without titlebar" option (you can explore the others later, if you want) and click next. Leave it on "Start no client" and click next. Then, in the "Additional parameters" input, add "-ac" and click next. I recommend clicking "Save configuration" for ease of use.</p>
              <p>At this point, you should have a black screen waiting to accept a display input.</p>
            </div>

            <p><b>13. Run Regolith Desktop</b></p>
            <p>The last thing to do is run the magic line:</p>
            <div>
              <pre><code>i3-gnome-flashback-session</code></pre>
              <p>You should then see a graphical Regolith Desktop appear in the VcXsrv window! Huzzah! Feel free to play around with your new graphical WSL2 setup. To see an overview of the available shortcuts, use "Alt+Shift+?" to bring up the help menu. You can find more help in Regolith's official <a target="_blank" href="https://regolith-linux.org/docs/">documentation</a>.</p>

					<h3>Abstract</h3><p>
					Native apps have become the norm of mobile interaction with digital services, but it’s an expensive way to reach users. With responsive web design, a more inclusive and accessible experience can be crafted for all mobile users instead of just a majority. This article describes the move from a native library app to a responsive website, and why it is right for the future.

      <p> <em>Published: </em> 10/07/2020</p>

      <p>I’m not a hater, but there are some things in the modern javascript community that drive me bananas. These are stupid, small, minor things but I keep scratching my head as to why do they do it this way? So I wrote a ranty post about ClassNames in React. It’s enlighting and silly.</p>



<p>Because we’re fancy pants React developers we have to write new and exciting ways to do the same old same old, enter the <code>className</code> property. Because we’re <strong>always</strong> writing dynamic code, we have to write a bunch of code for a single className. The class name attribute only takes 1 argument: a string or a variable. It cannot be a list.</p>

<p>Enter Example 1 from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html">React’s documentation</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// pass as a string</span>
<span>render</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>span</span> <span>className</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>menu navigation-menu</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Menu</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/span</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>}</span>

<p>What does className actually do? It appears NOTHING at all. Why can’t we use <code>class</code>? Because we’re React Developers! It pretty much comes down to the fact that <code>class</code> is a reserved word in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46989454/class-vs-classname-in-react-16/46991278#:~:text=class%20is%20a%20keyword%20in,has%20changed%20in%20that%20regard.&amp;text=Token%20class%20denotes%20that%20the,follows%20is%20a%20class%20declaration.">Javascript and by extension JSX</a> But the documentation does not give this as a reason why!</p>



<p>Well, you can in fact pass in strings, but if you need to use a variable, thats all it does, it takes a string. So to get dynamic behavior you have to write it. Duh, Adam, CSS you’d have to write it anyways. Well, yeah, but if we’re extending existing markup and code, can’t we make it better? Otherwise we’re pointlessly reinventing the wheel to be cool. I hate doing extra work to be cool; I’m a programmer, I’m supposed to work smarter not harder!</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx">CLSX</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames#usage-with-reactjs">classnames</a> or the <a href="https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/multiple-css-classes-react/">DIY approach</a>: these are great, but if we’re going to use classNames={} can’t it automatically support dynamic nature? I’d love to see this (without an extra lib, or method call!):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>className</span><span>=</span><span>{[</span><span>'</span><span>myStrongClassName</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>myVariableOfClasses</span><span>,</span> <span>myMethodCall</span><span>(),</span> <span>isActive</span><span>?</span><span>activeStyle</span><span>:</span><span>inactiveStyle</span><span>]}</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No wrapping it in method calls, just one approach. Ugh.</p>

<p>End rant</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Let say you have some struct <code>square</code> you want to compute the area of.</p>
<p><code>struct square { int width; }</code></p>
<p>You could of course do that:</p>
<p><code>int area(square s) { return s.width * s.width; }</code></p>
<p>But, your friend Tony told you to use more functions, so instead you do that</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>area</span>(square s) { <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s); }
<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(square s) { <span>return</span> s.width; }
</code></pre></div><p><code>area</code> being the function you really care about it is defined first - after all, code reads from top to bottom.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed from the lack of <code>;</code> after the struct’s closing bracket, the above code is written in D.
I figure my readership isn’t really into D, so maybe you would prefer some <strong>Rust</strong>?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>area</span>(square: <span>Square</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> {<span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span>width(s)<span> </span>*<span> </span>width(s)<span> </span>}<span>
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>width</span>(square: <span>Square</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>i32</span> {<span> </span><span>return</span><span> </span>s.width<span> </span>}<span>
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>struct</span> <span>Square</span><span> </span>{<span> </span>width: <span>i32</span> }<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>You can even compute the area of you square <strong><em>at scale</em></strong> with go</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>Area</span>(s square) <span>int</span> { <span>return</span> <span>width</span>(s) * <span>width</span>(s); }
<span>func</span> <span>width</span>(s square) <span>int</span> { <span>return</span> s.width }
<span>type</span> square <span>struct</span> { width  <span>int</span> }
</code></pre></div><p>Or even <strong>Swift</strong>ly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>func</span> <span>area</span>(s: Square) -&gt; <span>Int</span> { <span>return</span> width(s:s) * width(s:s); }
<span>func</span> <span>width</span>(s: Square) -&gt; <span>Int</span> { <span>return</span> s.width }
<span>struct</span> <span>Square</span> { <span>var</span> <span>width</span>:<span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>; }
</code></pre></div><p>But of course, <em>you</em> will worry about the overhead and will want the language the most performant (that’s not a word).
Eager to please and impress, let me copy the D code and add that oh-so-important semi-colon.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>square</span> { <span>int</span> width; };
<span>int</span> <span>area</span>(square s)  { <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s); }
<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(square s) { <span>return</span> s.width; }
</code></pre></div><p>That’s nice, isn’t it?  Interesting how most languages look alike.
Hum, wait, that doesn’t work???!!!</p>
<p><code>error: 'width' was not declared in this scope</code></p>
<p>But, you stupid thing, it’s <em>RIGHT THERE</em>.
I declared everything in the global scope like a maniac, can’t you see?</p>
<p>Alas, the standard makes the compiler blind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the definition of a function that is a member of namespace N, a name used after the function’s declarator-id23 shall be declared before its use in the block in which it is used or in one of its enclosing blocks ([stmt.block]) or shall be declared before its use in namespace N or, if N is a nested namespace, shall be declared before its use in one of N’s enclosing namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this makes no sense, a compiler can really easily parse the declaration independently of the definition, as
proven by other languages. Or you know, C++ classes. (imagine replacing a big namespace with a class full of static methods and nested types)
Unless of course, it’s a performance thing.
But, you are a very great engineer, so you wouldn’t let a source file grow above a few hundred lines of code, would you?
I bet your code is beautiful, like this small self-contained super useful program</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>int</span> <span>main</span> () {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; <span>"Hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Which on my system expands to about <em>33000</em> lines of code. The freaking thing. But more on that later.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to square one.
C++, in its infinite wisdom, lets us forward-declare functions, so we can write this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>square</span> { <span>int</span> width; };
<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s);
<span>int</span> <span>area</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s)  { <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s); }
<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) { <span>return</span> s.width; }
</code></pre></div><p>Which is nice and dandy, if you squint.</p>
<p>Besides requiring you to get the exact declaration of functions perfectly right - which is hard to maintain, lots of entities are not forward-declarable,
notably type alias, templated types, etc.
Which is an odd limitation given that where forward declaring a function require you
to know the precise signature, for types you are merely trying to introduce a name.</p>
<h2 id="noexcept">noexcept</h2>
<p>You will notice that <code>area</code> never throws.
That is, there is no subexpression of <code>area</code> that can throw, ever.</p>
<p>You can check that it does not.</p>
<p><code>static_assert(noexcept(area(square{})));</code></p>
<p>Inevitably,  that fails.
<code>error: static assertion failed</code>.
We indeed forgot to tell the compiler that our function could not throw.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>width</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) <span>noexcept</span>;
<span>int</span> <span>area</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) <span>noexcept</span> { <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s); }
<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) <span>noexcept</span> { <span>return</span> s.width; }
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that we need to add <code>noexcept</code> on all declarations, including the forward declarations.
And, you can lie to the compiler pretty easily.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>area</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) <span>noexcept</span> {
    <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s);
}

<span>int</span> <span>width</span>(<span>const</span> square&amp; s) {
    <span>throw</span> <span>42</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>The above code will <code>std::terminate()</code>, you know that the compiler knows that, everybody knows that.</p>
<p>So…what functions should be marked <code>noexcept</code>?
It’s pretty simple actually. All the functions that can not throw.
That is the functions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t contain a <code>throw</code> exception</li>
<li>Don’t call non-noexcept functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the double (triple?) negative.</p>
<p>So you, as a developer striving to mark all function that can be <code>noexcept</code> as such,
have to walk the call tree recursively until you can ascertain that the call chain will never throw
or actually might (because one callee does throw, or is at a C interface boundary, etc).
One argument against exceptions is that it makes reasoning about control flow harder:
Exceptions more or less force you to reason about the control flow of the whole program at every time.
<code>noexcept</code> is supposed to solve that, but, to put that <code>noexcept</code> keyword confidently, you still need
to do that analyze. The chances you get it wrong are high.
If you write generic code, you will have to tell the compiler that a symbol is noexcept
if all of it’s subexpression is noexcept manually.</p>
<p>And the compiler can not trust you that the function will indeed not throw, so implementers will inject calls to <code>std::terminate</code>
here and there, negating somewhat the performance benefits of marking the function <code>noexcept</code> in the first place.</p>
<p>Let’s rewrite our code using lambda instead</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>auto</span> width = [](<span>const</span> square&amp; s) -&gt; <span>int</span> {
    <span>return</span> s.width;
};
<span>auto</span> area = [](<span>const</span> square&amp; s) -&gt; <span>int</span> {
    <span>return</span> <span>width</span>(s) * width(s);
};
</code></pre></div><p>Of course, lambdas cannot be forward declared.
So I had to reorganize the code.</p>
<p>And now, despite the lack of <code>noexcept</code> keyword,
<code>static_assert(noexcept(area(square{})));</code> passes.</p>
<p><strong>What is happening?</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that the compiler is pretty good at knowing which functions are <code>noexcept</code>.
In the case of lambdas, the definition will always be visible to the compiler before any invocation,
so it can implicitly mark it no except and do the work for us. This allowed as part of C++20.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-noexcept-even-mean">What does noexcept even mean?</h3>
<p>I’m not saying that <code>noexcept</code> would not be necessary in an ideal world, because it has more than one meaning
and people use it differently. Notably, <code>noexcept</code> might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not generate exception handling code for this function</li>
<li>This function does not throw</li>
<li>This function will <em>never</em> throw</li>
</ul>
<p>The first statement is a request for the compiler, the second is an assertion for both the compiler and human readers,
while the last one is exclusively for people.</p>
<p>So <code>noexcept</code> would remain interesting at API boundary as a contract between people even if the compiler could decide
for itself whether the function was actually non-throwing.</p>
<h2 id="transaction_safe">transaction_safe</h2>
<p>The Transactional Memory TS defines the notion of <em>transaction safe expression</em> as follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An expression is transaction-unsafe if it contains any of the following as a potentially-evaluated subexpression (3.2[basic.def.odr]):</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1 [conv.lval]) applied to a volatile glvalue</li>
<li>an expression that modifies an object through a volatile glvalue</li>
<li>the creation of a temporary object of volatile-qualified type or with a subobject of volatile-qualified type</li>
<li>a function call (5.2.2 expr.call) whose postfix-expression is an id-expression that names a non-virtual
function that is not transaction-safe</li>
<li>an implicit call of a non-virtual function that is not transaction-safe</li>
<li>any other <strong>call of a function, where the function type is not “transaction_safe function”</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>
<p>The details are not important, but, basically, a <code>transaction_safe</code> safe expression is one that doesn’t touch volatile objects.
And only call functions with the same properties.
That’s probably upward of 99% of functions - I suspect the very terrible default exists for compatibility reasons.
The important part is that you have to tag all your functions or hope that the property holds true recursively.
(Like <code>noexcept</code>, you can lie, by marking a function <code>transaction_safe</code> even if a callee is not itself <code>transaction_safe</code>, opening the door to UB).
An issue that seems to hold this TS back.</p>
<h2 id="constexpr">constexpr</h2>
<p><code>constexpr</code> functions are a bit different. The compiler knows what functions are candidate <code>constexpr</code>.
Most of the time it will constant evaluate them regardless of whether they are actually marked as such.
The keyword is required to ensure that the compiler will actually do the constant evaluation when it can and, most importantly,
because removing the constexpr-ness of a function may be a source breaking change - (if that function is called during the evaluation of a <code>constexpr</code> variable).
By its very nature, <code>constexpr</code> implies that <code>constexpr</code> functions are defined somewhere is the TU. And everything not defined in the TU cannot be constant-evaluated.
<a href="https://wg21.link/p1235">A proposal for C++20 proposes to make it implicit in some cases</a></p>
<p>For now, we are left with the following code, and it is on you to use the appropriate qualifiers.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>constexpr</span> <span>int</span> <span>width</span>(square s) <span>noexcept</span> transaction_safe;
<span>constexpr</span> <span>int</span> <span>area</span>(square s) <span>noexcept</span> transaction_safe  { <span>return</span> width(s) * width(s); }
<span>constexpr</span> <span>int</span> <span>width</span>(square s) <span>noexcept</span> transaction_safe { <span>return</span> s.width; }
</code></pre></div><p>As of C++20, <code>constexpr</code> functions can throw. The committee is also considering making <code>new</code> expressions
<code>noexcept</code> by 23 or 26 so we are slowly getting to a place where 95%+ of functions will be both <code>constexpr</code> and <code>noexcept</code>
eligible and will have to be marked manually.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a better way ?</strong></p>

<p>A source file and its included headers form a translation unit.
Multiple translations units form a program.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough right?
It’s actually <em>simpler</em> than right.</p>
<p>Headers and sources files are a bit of a lie we tell ourselves.
As far as I can tell, the term “header” only appear in the standard as to name the …</p></div></div>

    <a href="https://cee.studio/?bucket=200928-vhV&amp;name=tsearch" target="_blank">live demo</a> to reproduce it.
    </p>

    <p>In <strong>tdelete()</strong>'s man page<sup><a href="#foot_notes">1</a></sup>, the <strong>RETURN
        VALUE</strong> specifies that "tdelete() returns a pointer to the parent of the
        item deleted, or NULL if the item was not found." It seems that
        <strong>tdelete()</strong> can return dangling pointers.
    </p><p>
    In order to verify the warning, we wrote a
    <a href="https://github.com/cee-studio/tdelete" target="_blank">test</a> to
    test both musl libc's and glibc's <strong>tdelete()</strong>.
    The output of the test (as seen below) shows that two dangling pointers
    are returned for each test.

    </p><pre><code>Testing glibc's tdelete
  ...

  call tdelete to delete 2
  &gt;&gt; free(<i>0x7f52e7f503ec</i>)
  tdelete returns <i>0x7f52e7f503ec</i> &lt;-- <i>dangling pointer</i>
  root is 0x7f52e7f50450

  call tdelete to delete 3
  &gt;&gt; free(<i>0x7f52e7f50450</i>)
  tdelete returns <i>0x7f52e7f50450</i> &lt;-- <i>dangling pointer</i>
  root is (nil)

Testing musl libc's tdelete
  ...
    
  call tdelete to delete 2
  &gt;&gt; free(<i>0x7f1d9d9553ec</i>)
  tdelete returns <i>0x7f1d9d9553ec</i> &lt;-- <i>dangling pointer</i>
  root is 0x7f1d9d955450

  call tdelete to delete 3
  &gt;&gt; free(<i>0x7f1d9d955450</i>)
  tdelete returns <i>0x7f1d9d955450</i> &lt;-- <i>dangling pointer</i>
  root is (nil)
</code>
</pre>

    <p>Returning a dangling pointer is dangerous, especially for
        functions included in libc, as dereferencing the dangling pointer
        can cause memory errors and security vulnerabilities. It's evident the
        problematic behavior of <strong>tdelete()</strong> has existed since the
        function's inception.
    </p>

    <p>As pointed out by members of r/C_programming and
        HN, <strong>tdelete()</strong>'s man page on various systems warn
        about the risk of dangling pointers in different but convoluted ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/tdelete.html">OpenGroup</a></li>
        <p>The <strong>tdelete()</strong> function shall return a pointer to the parent of the deleted node, or an
            unspecified non-null pointer if the deleted node was the root node, or a null pointer
            if the node is not found.
        </p>
        <li>macOS man page:</li>
        <p>The <strong>tdelete()</strong> function deletes a node from the specified binary search tree and returns a pointer
            to the parent of the node that was deleted. It takes the same arguments as tfind()
            and tsearch(). If the node to be deleted is the root of the binary search tree,
            rootp will be adjusted.
        </p>
        <li><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/tdelete.3.html">Debian buster</a></li>
        <p>
            <strong>tdelete()</strong> returns a pointer to the parent of the node deleted, or NULL if the item was
            not found. If the deleted node was the root node, tdelete() returns a dangling
            pointer that must not be accessed.
        </p>
        <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tdelete#RETURN_VALUES">OpenBSD</a></li>
        <p>
          <strong>tdelete()</strong> returns a pointer to the parent of the deleted node or an
            unspecified non-null pointer if the root node is deleted.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <p>Correctly using the function's return values is counter-intuitive as shown in this
        <a href="https://github.com/cee-studio/tdelete/blob/master/correct_use.c">example</a>.
        It requires a very good understanding of C's memory model and how <strong>tdelete()</strong>
        adjusts the root pointer. To prevent any misuses by less experienced developers,
        we believe the most effective warning as pointed out by u/notaplumber is
        <strong>"the return value of tdelete() should not be relied on at all."</strong>.

        In terms of risk among these systems, OpenBSD's <strong>tdelete()</strong>
        is the safest for developers. Both glibc and musl libc still return
        'legit' dangling pointers that can be dereferenced and therefore leave their
        users more vulnerable.
    </p>

    <p>
    We were lucky because Cee.Studio automatically checks whether all memory
    accesses and pointers violate C's memory model. If we were relying
    on our man page and Google search, we would have introduced use-after-free
    bugs inadvertently.
    </p>

    <p>After being surprised by <strong>tdelete()</strong>'s
        problematic return values, we searched CVE databases with the
        hope that this problem was documented. The search returned no
        such documentation, and we decided to file one. The following
        is the response from cve.mitre.org:
    </p><p><i> Unfortunately, we cannot assign a CVE ID for a documented behavior of
        tdelete. We can assign a CVE ID for an application that accesses the
        dangling pointer in a way that always causes a security-related
        impact. (We cannot assign a CVE ID for a finding that access to the
        dangling pointer is undefined behavior.)</i>
    </p><p>
    MITRE's response is counterproductive to its mission in several ways:
    </p><ol>
        <li>
            The latest glibc and musl libc still return 'legit' dangling
            pointers that could be dereferenced without causing visible
            memory errors.
        </li>
        <li>Many of Legacy OSs' man pages do not warn the user about the dangling pointer risk,
            and CVE# is not just for vulnerabilities in newer OSs.
        </li>
        <li>Many production softwares are NOT developed on the latest OSs.
            Issuing a CVE# would have notified AppSec teams
            so they can to do self-checks as well as warn their developers. Similarly, 
            AppSec companies can add the problem to their checklist.
        </li>
        <li>CVE#s can be issued to existing or future misuses. However, 
            the root cause would still not be addressed, allowing developers to
            introduce more vulnerabilities.
        </li>
    </ol><p>

    The lesson from this example is that employing comprehensive memory access
    violation checking and testing would be a more efficient way to prevent
    memory errors and potential security vulnerabilities.

        <p>Hi folks! Today I'll be chatting about <strong>Traversal Systems</strong> like <strong>jq</strong> and <strong>XPath</strong>; we're going to discover which properties make them useful, then see how we can replicate their most useful behaviours in Haskell using (almost entirely) pre-ols!existing standard Haskell tools! Let's go!</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-traversal-system">What's a Traversal System?</h2>
<p>First off I'll admit that "Traversal System" is a name I just came up with, you probably won't find anything if you search for it (unless this post really catches on 😉).</p>
<p>A <strong>Traversal System</strong> allows you dive deeply into a piece of data and may allow you to fetch, query, and edit the structure as you go while maintaining references to other pieces of the structure to influence your work. The goal of most Traversal Systems is to make this as painless and concise as possible. It turns out that this sort of thing is <strong>incredibly useful</strong> for manipulating JSON, querying HTML and CSS, working with CSVs, or even just handling standard Haskell Records and data-types.</p>
<p>Some good examples of existing <strong>Traversal Systems</strong> which you may have heard of include the brilliant <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> utility for manipulating and querying JSON, the <strong>XPath</strong> language for querying XML, and the <a href="https://github.com/noprompt/meander">meander</a> data manipulation system in Clojure. Although each of these systems may appear drastically different at a glance, they both <em>accomplish many of the same goals</em> of manipulating and querying data in a concise way.</p>
<p>The similarities between these systems intrigued me! They seem so similar, but yet still seem to share very little in the way of structure, syntax, and prior art. They re-invent the wheel for each new data type! Ideally we could recognize the useful behaviours in each system and build a generalized system which works for any data type.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to do exactly that; we'll take a look at a few things that these systems do well, then we'll re-build them in Haskell using standard tooling, all the while abstracting over the type of data!</p>
<h2 id="optics-as-a-basis-for-a-traversal-system">Optics as a basis for a traversal system</h2>
<p>For any of those who know me it should be no surprise that my first thought was to look at optics (i.e. Lenses and Traversals). In general I find that optics solve a lot of my problems, but in this case they are particularly appropriate! Optics inherently deal with the idea of diving deep into data and querying or updating data in a structured and compositional fashion.</p>
<p>In addition, optics also allow abstracting over the data type they work on. There are pre-existing libraries of optics for working with JSON via <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-aeson"><code>lens-aeson</code></a> and for html via <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens"><code>taggy-lens</code></a>. I've written optics libraries for working with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-csv">CSVs</a> and even <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-regex-pcre">Regular Expressions</a>, so I can say confidently that they're a brilliantly adaptable tool for data manipulation.</p>
<p>It also happens that optics are well-principled and mathematically sound, so they're a good tool for studying the properties that a system like this may have.</p>
<p>However, optics themselves don't provide everything we need! Optics are rather obtuse, in fact I wrote <a href="https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example">a whole book</a> to help teach them, and they lack clarity and easy of use when it comes to building larger expressions. It's also pretty tough to work on one part of a data structure while referencing data in another part of the same structure. My hope is to address some of these short comings in this post.</p>
<p>In this particular post I'm mostly interested in explaining a framework for traversal systems in Haskell, we'll be using many standard <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl"><strong>mtl</strong></a> Monad Transformers alongside a lot of combinators from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens"><strong>lens</strong></a> library. You won't need to understand any of these intimately to get the <em>gist</em> of what's going on, but I won't be explaining them in depth here, so you may need to look elsewhere if you're lacking a bit of context.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-the-problem">Establishing the Problem</h2>
<p>I'll be demoing a few examples as we go along so let's set up some data. I'll be working in both <strong>jq</strong> and <strong>Haskell</strong> to make comparisons between them, so we'll set up the same data in both <strong>JSON</strong> and Haskell.</p>

<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>
<p>Let's dive into a few example queries to test the waters! First an easy one, let's write a query to find all the pets owned by any of our employees.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks in <strong>jq</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat company.json | jq '.staff[].pets[] | select(.type == "cat")'
{
  "name": "Rocky",
  "type": "cat"
}
{
  "name": "Inigo",
  "type": "cat"
}</code></pre>
<p>We look in the <code>staff</code> key, then <em>enumerate</em> that list, then for each staff member we enumerate their cats! Lastly we filter out anything that's not a cat.</p>
<p>We can recognize a few hallmarks of a <strong>Traversal System</strong> here. <strong>jq</strong> allows us to "dive" down deeper into our structure by providing a path to where we want to be. It also allows us to <strong>enumerate</strong> many possibilities using the <code>[]</code> operator, which will forward <strong>each</strong> value to the rest of the pipeline one after the other. Lastly it allows us to <strong>filter</strong> our results using <code>select</code>.</p>
<p>And in Haskell using optics it looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> toListOf (staff <span>.</span> folded <span>.</span> employeePets <span>.</span> folded <span>.</span> filteredBy (petType <span>.</span> only <span>"cat"</span>)) company</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>[ <span>Pet</span> {_petName <span>=</span> <span>"Rocky"</span>, _petType <span>=</span> <span>"cat"</span>}</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>, <span>Pet</span> {_petName <span>=</span> <span>"Inigo"</span>, _petType <span>=</span> <span>"cat"</span>}</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we use "toListOf" along with an optic which "folds" over each staff member, then folds over each of their pets, again filtering for "only" cats.</p>
<p>At a glance the two are extremely similar!</p>
<p>They each allow the <em>enumeration</em> of multiple values, in <strong>jq</strong> using <code>[]</code> and in optics using <code>folded</code>.</p>
<p>Both implement some form of <strong>filtering</strong>, <strong>jq</strong> using <code>select</code> and our optics with <code>filteredBy</code>.</p>
<p>Great! So far we've had no trouble keeping up! We're already starting to see a lot of similarities between the two, and our solutions using optics are easily generalizable to any data type.</p>
<p>Let's move on to a more complex example.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-references">Keeping references</h2>
<p>This time we're going to print out each pet and their owner!</p>
<p>First, here's the <strong>jq</strong>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>$ <span>cat</span> join.json <span>|</span> <span>jq</span> <span>'</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a><span>    .staff[] </span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>  | .name as $personName </span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a><span>  | .pets[] </span></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>  | "\(.name) belongs to \($personName)"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a><span>'</span></span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span>"Rocky belongs to bob"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a><span>"Bullwinkle belongs to bob"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a><span>"Inigo belongs to sally"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we see a new feature in <strong>jq</strong> which is the ability to maintain <strong>references</strong> to a part of the structure for later while we continue to dig deeper into the structure. We're grabbing the name of each employee as we enumerate them and saving it into <code>$personName</code> so we can refer to this later on. Then we enumerate each of the pets and use string interpolation to describe who owns each pet.</p>
<p>If we try to stick with optics on their own, well, it's possible, but unfortunately this is where it all starts to break down, look at this absolute mess:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>owners ::</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>

<p>You can bet that nobody is calling that "easy to read". Heck, I wrote a book on optics and it still took me a few tries to figure out where the brackets needed to go!</p>
<p>Optics are great for handling a <em>single</em> stream of values, but they're much worse at more complex expressions, especially those which require a reference to values that occur <em>earlier</em> in the chain. Let's see how we can address those shortcomings as we build our <strong>Traversal System</strong> in Haskell.</p>
<p>Just for the <strong>jq</strong> aficionados in the audience I'll show off this alternate version which uses a little bit of <em>magic</em> that <strong>jq</strong> does for you.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a> $ <span>cat</span> company.json <span>|</span> <span>jq</span> <span>'.staff[] | "\(.pets[].name) belongs to \(.name)"'</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a><span>"Rocky belongs to bob"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a><span>"Bullwinkle belongs to bob"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a><span>"Inigo belongs to sally"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Depending on your experience may be less <strong>magical</strong> and more <strong>confusing</strong> 😬. Since the final expression contains an <strong>enumeration</strong> (i.e. <code>\(.pets[].name)</code>) <strong>jq</strong> will expand the final term once for each value in the enumeration. This is really cool, but unfortunately a bit "less principled" and tough to understand in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, the behaviour is the same, and we haven't replicated it in Haskell satisfactorily yet, let's see what we can do about that!</p>
<h2 id="monads-to-the-rescue-again">Monads to the rescue (again...)</h2>
<p>In Haskell we love our <strong>embedded DSLs</strong>; if you give a Haskeller a problem to solve, you can bet that 9 times out of 10 they'll solve it with a custom monad and an DSL 😂. Well, I'm sorry to tell you that I'm no different!</p>
<p>We'll be using a monad to address the readability problem of the last optics solution, but the question is... <em>which</em> monad?</p>
<p>Since all we're doing at the moment is <strong>querying</strong> data, we can make use of the esteemed <strong>Reader Monad</strong> to provide a context for our query.</p>
<p>Here's what that last query looks like when we use the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html"><code>Reader</code></a> monad with the relatively …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Growing up in an Indian household and in one of the most
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey#Demographics">diverse states/towns</a> in the US, it’s not easy to avoid
the competitive stress that derives from first generation families.</p><p>From test scores, which classes I take, SAT scores, college admissions, sports performance, internships received etc.,
the first 22 years of my life have been filled with constant competition with others. As a result I’ve turned out to
be a pretty competitive person - if there was anything that I liked, I not only wanted to be good at it, but I also wanted
to be better at it than others.</p><p>Something happened right around when I graduated college and joined the workforce. My Saturdays were totally free and
weren’t consumed by an all-day track meet where I would compete in the 800m and gruel over two laps trying to edge out
other people over the finish line. After work, my weekday nights consisted of me making dinner instead of living in the
library and taking caffeine pills to study for a test that I’ve been procrastinating to study for. </p><p>For the first time in my life there was no clear next step in what I had to do, and there was no clear competition that
I could engage in with peers. It was a dramatic change and something that I refer to as my quarter life crisis. It’s not
well documented in many places, but it’s a concept that I think is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-life_crisis">picking up steam</a> in recent years.</p><h3>What does a Quarter-Life Crisis look like?</h3><p>I think there’s one song that really encapsulates this feeling, The Beatles’
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8scSwaKbE64">Nowhere Man</a>. The opening lines go:</p><blockquote><p>He's a real nowhere man.
Sitting in his nowhere land.
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody</p></blockquote><p>In fact, the song is what inspired me to name my blog post <strong>Nowhere Plans</strong>. John Lennon was 25 when he wrote this,
and I think he really captures the general feeling of this time in one’s life.</p><p>Back when I was in college and high school I was really competitive with other people, whether in academics or sports,
and I felt I had a strong purpose - anything that I did was to get further in these pursuits. It was a nice and easy
framework to live life by. Decision making was incredibly easy.</p><p>Fast forward to work-life ~&gt; I felt that I couldn’t really relate much to my work peers, and all my college and high
school friends were vibing and doing their own thing in their respective companies. I spent my nights binge watching
shows, my weekends binge watching movies, and my free time working or hanging with peers talking about the binge
watched shows/movies. </p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Freeze">isolating</a> and incredibly gray city of Seattle didn’t help not
feeling like a nowhere man in nowhere land.</p><p>Maybe I’ll get a cat? Will that help find some purpose to be doing something? I’ll download some dating apps and try to
get a girlfriend, hopefully that should bring me closer to my next stage in life of marriage right? Should I go to grad
school? I have to, no, I need to do these things now! 😬</p><p>I was truly lost in what my next steps in life were going to be, and felt that I was just aimlessly swimming around in a sea of uncertainty.</p><h3>Swimming Out</h3><p>When 2019 had come, I knew I wanted to do something different. I made a list of things that were important to me and that I
wanted to achieve. Visiting friends more, learning to play the piano, getting back into running races, fixing my posture, volunteering etc. </p><p>But the biggest shift in my thinking during this time was to try to bring back competition in my life. No, not competition
with others like I had previously experienced all my life, but instead with something much easier to think about. Myself. </p><p>There’s a saying that you should “Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today”. People always
say that you’ll never find happiness comparing yourself to others, and that competitive stress is really bad for you. While that
is true, I also don’t think many people advocate for competition against yourself. It’s possibly because of the stress and
anxiety induced from competition, but if you’re anything like me, it’s necessary to find some purpose and bring back a fire
in you to go about and live life.</p><p>In 2019, I had worked on things I had never done in my life in order to be a better person than who I was in years past.
I’ll probably never be as fit as I was in college on the varsity XC/T&amp;F teams, but hey, in 2019 I
set <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/19875553">personal records</a> in
the 10 mile and marathon (granted it was my only time running them but that’s besides the point). </p><p>I also had an entirely different view in perceiving others. Anyone who has spent 5 min on LinkedIn can describe this
feeling - seeing other people who are really successful and do the things that you’ve always want to do is disheartening to
say the least. You feel like somewhere along your life path you made a wrong turn which didn’t lead you to where that other
person is. But, at the end of the day, that’s just life - there’s always going to be someone better than you at everything
you do, you just have to find solace in that you’re better than who you used to be.</p><h3>Where are you now?</h3><p>This past year has been wild. It felt like a decade fit into 9 months so far, but with all the major events and uncertainty
happening, I’ve never felt more certain about myself than I have now.</p><p>I try to focus on things that I really enjoy, and try to be better than my former self. I stopped going to my piano teacher
because of COVID, but still try to play the pieces that I remember learning every now and then while also trying to learn
some more music theory. Writing and deep diving on topics that I find interesting have always been a favorite past-time of
mine, why not start a blog and have others critique me to become better? And finally, if I’m going to make a career out of
my current profession, why not be the best that I can be in more ways than programming. I’ve engaged in more leadership
opportunities to mentor younger engineers and also participate in the daunting interviewing process but this time as an interviewer.</p><p>Through this process I’ve grown to know that I really enjoy helping and teaching others - it’s something that has helped me
envision what I want to be doing as I grow.</p><p>I don’t advise many people to live life with this much analysis on your past self, but if this story resonated with you I
encourage to try it out! It’s helped me get out of a quarter life crisis and will hopefully keep me going until my
inevitable mid-life crisis. Stay tuned for that post.</p></section></div>]]>

                    <p><em>My Journey Re-Inventing the SIEM for Cloud-First Security Teams </em></p><p>By: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacknaglieri/">Jack Naglieri</a></p><p>Five years ago I joined Airbnb’s Security team to create a system for analyzing high volumes of critical security data and identifying suspicious behaviors that could indicate a breach. This system is known as a SIEM, which stands for Security Information and Event Management, and is one of the primary tools used by detection and response teams to secure enterprise environments. </p><p>Over the past 15 years the SIEM market has gone through multiple phases of evolution, from traditional “boxes”, to log analytics platforms, to the cloud-centric solutions offered today. <strong>At Airbnb, we evaluated all of the industry-leading options and ultimately decided to build our own, called <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/streamalert">StreamAlert</a>.</strong> In this blog, I’ll explain the motivation behind that decision and how it inspired me to start <a href="https://runpanther.io/">Panther</a> in August 2018.</p><h2 id="problems-with-siem-a-brief-history-">Problems with SIEM (A Brief History)</h2><p>In the beginning, traditional SIEMs like ArcSight and QRadar were introduced to ingest data and output alerts from built-in detection rules. But for years teams struggled to produce high quality alerts and handle the increasingly larger volumes of data companies produced as they scaled. </p><p>When these limitations became clear, the industry gravitated towards general-purpose log analytics solutions like Splunk, Sumo Logic, and Elastic that were designed for exploration of all types of log data. With some added development work, security teams could use these tools to collect and analyze data for security investigations and threat detection. Eventually, purpose-built SIEM offerings were introduced by these vendors, but the fundamental issues remained: <strong>Their architectures weren’t built for the cloud, and as data volumes and attack surfaces continued to explode, these tools became cumbersome and expensive to operate.</strong></p><p>As we evaluated our options at Airbnb, we felt like the problems with traditional SIEMs had manifested themselves yet again and we were back to square one.</p><h2 id="building-a-new-path-forward">Building a New Path Forward</h2><p>Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a quintessential modern tech company. Its production environment was born in Amazon Web Services and therefore has a very different set of requirements for security. Instead of data centers and on-premise applications, the focus is virtual machines, containers, and SaaS applications that power the business. </p><p>When I joined the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) team, <strong>our goal was to build a cloud-native SIEM that could analyze Terabytes of data per day and enable a small team to detect threats faster with more expressivity than was ever possible before. </strong>After learning from our past experiences at other large tech companies (e.g. Facebook, Yahoo, Dropbox), our team decided to take a new approach and <em>not</em> use a log analytics platform. Instead, we set out to use the power of cloud services to avoid the pains of the past and created an open source project called StreamAlert, which I announced at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVtzMy_tNcQ">Enigma 2017</a>.</p><p>StreamAlert is a serverless, data analysis framework that analyzes logs in real-time. It works by comparing data against Python-based rules and sending alerts when matches are found. StreamAlert addressed many of the challenges we had at the time: It was easy to deploy, could be customized to fit internal business use-cases, and was less expensive to operate than incumbent solutions. <strong>One of the primary ways we drove down costs was by using Serverless technology (or FaaS),</strong> which offers a modern application hosting paradigm where developers can simply provide packaged code and leverage cloud services for orchestration, horizontal/vertical scaling, and reliability. In essence, Serverless is an abstraction above running a container-based application in a platform like Kubernetes or ECS that enables a system to scale with configuration options rather than infrastructure changes.</p><p>For two years I led the development of StreamAlert and helped grow Airbnb’s security engineering team from one to four members, complemented by several analysts. We fostered an open source community, scaled our internal deployment capacity to power Airbnb’s growing incident response (IR) program, and added new features that served both our internal needs and the needs of those in our community. As the project grew, <strong>I continued to see more and more high-tech companies adopting StreamAlert to alleviate the pain they also felt with the status quo for SIEM</strong>. This fueled my desire to work on the problem full-time and take the concept we developed at Airbnb to the next level.</p><h2 id="founding-panther">Founding Panther</h2><p>In 2018, I left Airbnb to start Panther with the goal of redesigning StreamAlert to avoid the pitfalls I had discovered while operating the system at scale. Because StreamAlert is 100% command-line driven, security analysts often struggle to create new detections. In addition, over the years the platform accrued technical debt that’s resulted in issues with its data infrastructure and limited its ability to scale. </p><p><strong>My goal with Panther was to recruit an A-team of engineers to build an Enterprise-grade detection platform that offered an intuitive interface, was designed for 10x scale, and was flexible enough to support the wide range of use cases security teams commonly struggle with today.</strong> </p><p>In early 2020, our team <a href="https://blog.runpanther.io/panther-v1-open-source-siem/">open sourced Panther v1</a>, which incorporates many of the features people love about StreamAlert while also introducing a number of notable improvements, such as:</p><ol><li><strong>A beautiful UI</strong> to write and manage rules, onboard data sources, analyze alerts, query structured data, and configure alert destinations</li><li><strong>Pre-built detections</strong> to identify a variety of suspicious activity across Cloud, SaaS, and endpoint data sources</li><li><strong>A backend written in Golang </strong>capable of processing data at a much higher scale (~10x) at a lower cost</li><li><strong>Support for threat hunting </strong>and interfacing with business intelligence tools</li><li><strong>A pluggable data backend </strong>with support to<strong> </strong>send logs directly into Snowflake</li><li><strong>Faster time to value </strong>with enterprise support and a fully-hosted (single-tenant) SaaS offering</li></ol><p><strong><strong>One of my foundational beliefs is that security teams should focus on detecting the bad guys, not operations. With Panther, more security teams can make this a reality.</strong></strong></p><h2 id="security-at-cloud-scale">Security at Cloud-Scale</h2><p>The world is shifting from analysts and dashboards to automation and code. By enabling security teams to operationalize massive volumes of security data with cloud-first architectures and developer-driven workflows, I believe Panther can serve as the foundation for modern organizations to quickly bootstrap detection and response programs and secure cloud environments. </p><p><strong>Today, Panther is a dedicated team of 20+ people and we <a href="https://blog.runpanther.io/series-a-funding/">just raised $15M</a> to keep growing.</strong> The platform already supports a wide variety of use cases and data integrations and is well-positioned to innovate quickly on new ideas from our community. A few recent features we’re excited to introduce include:</p><ol><li><strong>Indicator Search</strong>: Quickly search all of your data for hits on IPs, domains, hashes, and more.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Rule Thresholds</strong>: </strong></strong>Only send an alert if a threshold has been exceeded within a time period, which is useful when looking at groups of events over time.</li><li><strong><strong>Alert Statuses</strong>: </strong>Triage, close, or resolve generated alerts along with having confidence that your alert made it to its destination.</li></ol><p>If you’re interested in learning more about upcoming features, check out our <a href="https://portal.productboard.com/runpanther/1-product-portal/tabs/2-in-progress">public roadmap.</a></p><p>My goal when starting Panther was to help all security teams deploy a SIEM that works at a modern scale. <strong>My time at Airbnb taught me that it was possible to decommission older platforms like Splunk in favor of new tools that follow the cloud-native paradigm validated by StreamAlert, and now Panther.</strong> Panther is the next step in this journey, and I’ve incorporated all of the lessons learned from my time at Airbnb and combined it with the diverse backgrounds of my engineering team. </p><p>I’m truly proud of what we’ve built thus far and what we’ll continue to build in the future. We’ll relentlessly push the traditional boundaries of SIEM to help teams prevent breaches at a cloud-scale.</p><p><strong>To see for yourself, <a href="https://docs.runpanther.io/quick-start">Run Panther</a>!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>OTTAWA -- 
	Under the <a href="http://Parliament’s back: Sign up for our Capital Dispatch newsletter ">newly-unveiled list</a> of single-use plastics being banned in Canada, plastic grocery bags, straws, stir sticks, six-pack rings, cutlery and food containers made from hard-to-recycle plastics will be out of use nationwide by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>
	Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson announced the federal government’s next steps towards its plan to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030.</p>
<p>
	“When a ban comes into effect, your local stores will be providing you with alternatives to these plastic products,” Wilkinson said, adding that he knows it’s hard to come back from a trip to the grocery store without single-use plastic products, especially food packaging, but that “has to change.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As first pledged last year, and re-committed in the Liberal’s September throne speech, the government is moving ahead with banning certain “harmful” single-use plastics that are consistently found in the environment and for which there are readily available alternatives, while finding ways to make sure more plastic is recycled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Citing the need to consult, the government will be soliciting <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/plastics-proposed-integrated-management-approach.html" target="_blank">feedback on a “discussion paper”</a> until Dec. 9. The finalized new regulations wouldn’t come into effect until the end of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters"><strong>Sign up here to receive The Climate Barometer, delivering climate and environmental news to your inbox every week</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	In the spring, Wilkinson signalled that the ban on single-use plastics may be delayed because of the pandemic. By the summer, a Canadian report found that public support for a <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fight-against-single-use-plastics-sidelined-by-covid-19-report-finds-1.5085244" target="_blank">crackdown on certain products was dwindling</a> as the majority of those surveyed said they liked the health and safety protections associated with disposable plastics over reusable alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Recognizing the ongoing need for single-use plastic personal protective equipment items like face shields, the federal government says the ban will not impact access to PPE, or other plastics used in medical facilities.</p>
<p>
	However, the government has been discussing the pollution impacts of the increased use of many disposable products during the pandemic and says it’s working with the provinces and territories on plans to properly dispose as much of it as possible.</p>
<p>
	“We're also investigating solutions to recycle PPE where it is safe to do so, and options to make some of the PPE biodegradable,” Wilkinson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	However, due to the pandemic and ongoing health restrictions, many restaurants have had to pivot to take-out meals and are providing customers with plastic cutlery, and it remains to be seen what kind of financial impact this looming ban will have on these businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The environment minister said the government selected these items because there are already readily-available and affordable alternatives, and that while many items will have to continue to be single-use, they need to be items that can be recycled.</p>
<p>
	“In the context of takeout, the focus is really on polystyrene which is a very difficult substance to recycle and it is one that we find quite widely in the environment. Many, many of the restaurants that do takeout have already transitioned away from polystyrene to other forms, whether it's cardboard or different forms of paper, which are recyclable,” Wilkinson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“At the end of the day, Canadians expect us as governments to take action on an issue that they know is an important one… and to be honest with you, Canadians are far ahead of their governments on the plastic issue they've been demanding this kind of action for a long time,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Already, some business groups are voicing concerns about the difference the ban will make and the “significant costs” some small businesses could be facing.</p>
<p>
	“Canadian businesses recognize the significant benefits of alternatives to single-use plastics and the importance of bolstering Canada’s circular economy. However, Canada’s approach must go beyond surface issues like bans, to address the critical infrastructure required to deliver on the positive benefits for the environment,” Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s Aaron Henry said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“At present, it remains unclear how this policy will address the current fragmented approaches to disposing consumer products,” Henry said, adding that, at this time when many businesses are counting every dollar, any extra costs could make the difference between staying open and closing for good.</p>
<p>
	While environmental groups welcomed the news, they are pushing the Liberals to go further with the ban.</p>
<p>
	“After three years of promising to tackle plastic waste and pollution, and to create a strategy that moves Canada towards zero plastic waste, the federal government has instead continued to largely rely on the recycling myth and the bare minimum ban list,” said Sarah King, head of the oceans and plastics campaign at Greenpeace Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“The only way to prevent toxic substances from getting into the environment is to ban all of them. The government says it wants to tackle the climate crisis, protect our oceans, and move toward a circular economy, but as long as single-use plastics continue to be produced at current rates, there is no incentive for companies to transition to cleaner and healthier reuse models,” King said.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	NEW RECYCLED CONTENT REQUIREMENTS&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
	When the <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canada-moving-on-single-use-plastics-ban-but-will-determine-products-later-1.4459274?cache=yes%3FclipId%3D89926%3FautoPlay%3Dtrue" target="_blank">ban on single-use plastics was first announced</a>, the federal government said it would be focusing on holding big companies responsible for their plastic production, requiring them to play a part in collecting and recycling their materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Wednesday’s announcement includes a proposal to establish recycled content requirements in products and packaging, which the federal government says will spark investment in recycling infrastructure and innovation in technology to extend the life of plastic materials to keep them in the economy, and out of the environment for longer.</p>
<p>
	The federal government has a target of at least 50 per cent recycled content in plastic products by 2030.</p>
<p>
	Under the new regulations the government will require:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A minimum percentage of recycled content;</li>
	<li>
		rules for measuring and evaluating the amount of recycled content; and</li>
	<li>
		guidelines and related tools to help companies meet their requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Wilkinson also pledged $2 million for a zero plastic waste initiative, to go to 14 Canadian-led projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Later this week, the federal government will be publishing a proposed order to add “plastic manufactured items” to the list of regulated products under Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA). Greenhouse gasses is among the items already on that list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to the federal government, Canadians throw away three million tonnes of plastic waste a year, and only nine per cent of that gets recycled, and about one-third of the plastics used in Canada are for single-use or short-lived products and packaging, including up to 15 billion plastic bags used every year and close to 57 million straws used daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The federal New Democrats and Greens said they are supportive of the Liberal’s plan to ban plastics and recycle more, citing it’s something they’ve pushed for some time.</p>
<p>
	“It doesn't make sense for us to be using plastics, as a throwaway, that will remain in our oceans and on our planet… but we want to see the details,” said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The federal Conservatives characterized the announcement as “desperate” attempts to keep a campaign promise and raised concerns with the costs to replace some commonly used single-use plastics in settings like long-term care homes.</p>
<p>
	Similarly, the Alberta government was not impressed with the announcement, despite that government’s stated desire to become a recycling hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	“We know that plastics are the foundation of the modern world,” said Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage. “The federal government needs to be working with the provinces, needs to be supporting things like our natural gas vision, and needs to be supporting things like our full lifecycle economy for plastics.”</p>

		<h2 id="0000036">00:00:03.6</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.
</p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about the use of Python and OCaml at Jane Street with Laurent Mazare. Jane Street is pretty widely known for the fact that we use OCaml, which is a statically typed, functional programming language similar to languages like Scala and F# and Swift and Haskell, but the story’s more complicated than that. We don’t only use OCaml, we use some other languages, too, and one that we use that’s pretty important is Python, and we mostly use Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks, but it also extends somewhat beyond those domains. So, the topic of the conversation this morning is about how Python fits in with OCaml and how it fits in to the broader infrastructure at Jane Street. One of the reasons I’m excited to have this conversation with Laurent, it’s both that he has done a lot of work inside of Jane Street, both working with Python and on making the Python tool, in itself, better, but also, he has broader experience working with different languages in different contexts, and so, has some perspective on this for more than just his time at Jane Street. So, Laurent, to start us off, can you tell us a little bit more about your experience outside of Jane Street and kind of how that led you to working here?</p></div>

<h2 id="0001256">00:01:25.6</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, my first work experience outside of academia was at a small company called LexiFi, where we were using OCaml to model financial contracts. So, in that context, OCaml was used mostly as a domain specific language to represent complex financial payoffs. I spent a couple years working on the overall infrastructure that we were selling to banks and asset managers. After that, I started working in 2010, at Goldman Sachs in London, as an equity strategist, and there I was using the in-house programming language called slang, which one can think of as a variant of Python. It’s mostly a scripting language, it was fairly nice to actually quickly see the output of what you were doing, but of course, efficiency was a bit of a concern. I spent a couple years working at Goldman, and then in 2013, I joined Jane Street as a software developer. I worked mostly on trading systems at Jane Street, so back to using OCaml on mostly everything, and there I enjoyed a lot the functional programming aspects and strong type system, when it comes to designing production critical stuff. After four years and something at Jane Street, I actually left to go work for DeepMind, mostly because I was passionate about machine learning at that point, and I wanted to work at leading edge of the domain. DeepMind is this world leading research company that specialize in reinforcement learning, it was acquired by Google around 2016, and is at the forefront of machine learning nowadays. At DeepMind, I used mostly Python to do machine learning and with of course, TensorFlow, and I also got to use Swift a bit as a replacement, potentially, for Python. I spent a year working there, and then I came back to work at Jane Street, where I focus more on researchy bits nowadays. So, I would say that I spend half of my time working in OCaml and half of my time working in Python, but these two halves are very different.</p>

<h2 id="0003546">00:03:54.6</h2>

<p>Another part of your background is you’ve also done some interesting work on the open source side, can you say a little bit about that.</p>

<h2 id="0004001">00:04:00.1</h2>

<p>So, I try to be active in the open source community, and through that I’ve had the opportunity to work on a couple of packages. The most notable one is probably <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/ocaml-torch">ocaml-torch</a>, which provides OCaml bindings for the PyTorch framework. PyTorch is this amazing thing developed by Facebook, that lets you write some deep-learning algorithms in Python, and leverage your GPU and the power of auto-differentiation. Via these OCaml bindings, you can do that from OCaml, too – so, you add type safety to the mix. I also worked on <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs">Rust bindings</a> for it, so, it’s kind of the same thing; in this context, you have bindings in Rust, so rather than writing Python code, you end up writing Rust. I also worked a bit on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a>, which is a Rust static analyzer, and there, you try to analyze Rust code and find legitimate errors. There are plenty of other OCaml packages that I looked at – bindings for TensorFlow, bindings for Apache Arrow, I tried writing a data frame library for OCaml… and a couple other things. All of them can be found <a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="0005177">00:05:17.7</h2>

<p>So, this all reflects that you’ve spent a bunch of time working in a bunch of different places using different languages and ecosystems. You mentioned along the way that here, about half of your time is spent working on Python and half it’s spent working in OCaml, and those two halves are very different. Maybe you can say a little bit more, how are those two different?</p>

<h2 id="0005361">00:05:36.1</h2>

<p>Yeah, the first half of my time is spent using Python, and that’s mostly for research purposes. In that context, I will use Python in a notebook. So, for people that don’t know what a notebook is, it’s a kind of web UI, where you have some cells where you input some lines of your programming language, most of the time Python, and you can evaluate each cell in order. The development mode is very interactive in this context. So, you look at the actual output, tweak your code a bit, then evaluate it again, then tweak your code again a bit because you notice that you’ve made some mistakes, and start over again, and again. So, it’s some kind of interactive development. What is fairly nice is that you have a very quick feedback loop between editing the code and seeing the actual outcome. And of course, it plugs very nicely with the very large Python ecosystem of plotting libraries. So, you can actually run your algorithm on some data, and then plug the output, check that it matches your intuition, if not, try to debug, tweak your code, and start over. So, that will be mostly what I use Python for, and on the other side, there is OCaml, and there, it’s for more [general] development work and production critical development, I would say, where you tend to build systems that are fairly resilient. What I’m often amazed by is that you write some OCaml job, you kind of spend a week on it, deploy it, and then you come back to it a few years later and maybe even you’ve left and come back along the way, and you notice that your job is actually still there and still working, which is pretty amazing. Of course, on the Python side, it’s a bit more rare that things would keep on working for a very long period of time.</p>

<h2 id="0007303">00:07:30.3</h2>

<p>Say more about why that is. What do you think it is about OCaml, that makes the easier for writing these kinds of more robust tasks, for catching bugs, all of that?</p>

<h2 id="0007303-1">00:07:30.3</h2>

<p>Yeah. So, I think there are two aspects actually to it. One, is about OCaml, and the other one is about the general engineering practice that we have  around OCaml. So, it turns out that when you write OCaml code, you usually write proper tests for your things, you think a lot about all the error cases. Again, part of it, because the type system will enforce that, and each function will tell you, oh, actually, I might return a result, but I might also return an error, and you have to think about what is the error is and how you want to handle it. Your goal is, build something that is a bit resilient, so you also are in a state of mind, where you think a lot about corner cases, whereas in the Python world, it’s more of about runtime exceptions. So, you don’t spend much time thinking about what the function actually outputs, and most of the time you use a library for which you don’t really know what the function outputs, it turns out that you kind of guess it, try it, most of the time it works, and you go on with that, you just check kind of interactively that it’s what you would expect.</p>

<h2 id="0008507">00:08:50.7</h2>

<p>I’m really struck by your description here. There’s a mix of differences between the two languages, and some of them are fundamental things about the language. Some of them are things about the ecosystem around the language, and some of them are issues about the practices that Jane Street as an organization has around the different languages. So, maybe we could just dig into those somewhat separately. Let’s first talk about the ecosystem. What is it about the Python ecosystem and the OCaml ecosystem that make them different?</p>

<h2 id="0009214">00:09:21.4</h2>

<p>Python, I think, nowadays, is kind of the de facto standard for everything that is about machine learning and data analysis. So, if you want to be able to plot your results, again, in a notebook, you have plenty of libraries that do that, plenty of tutorials online that will help you in finding the right way to do it, and if you run into any kind of issue, again, you can just Google things, you will get some results super easily. There is also a wide variety of machine learning libraries available, all the major modern deep-learning frameworks have Python frontends and are kind of released in a Python first manner, so the API that the developers will focus on is the Python one.  I don’t think that there originally was any very good reason for Python to be more successful than another language that’s also a bit similar like Ruby, in that domain, but it turns out that the more you have an ecosystem, the more it attracts people and it snowballs at some point. On the other side, when it comes to a OCaml, there are some, there are a bunch of libraries. I think that, in general, libraries tend to have a bit of a better quality but you have far fewer of them. One way to get around this, is that you can bind to other languages, so that’s what we did for TensorFlow and PyTorch, but you can even bind to Python. So, we actually have some matplotlib bindings when you want to plot something in OCaml, this will call Python which itself, will use this very well-known Matplotlib …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>I read a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2020/09/20/why-not-rust.html">Why Not Rust?</a> article the other day that was quite good but dismissed the most important reason to use a language to me: <strong>security</strong>. After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and security, yet I still have some pain points that will make me recommend <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> over Rust sometimes. Keep in mind that I have also spent my whole career looking for bugs in applications written in dozens of different languages, so my post might be highly controversial but it has to be looked from these lenses.</p>
<h2>Shallow standard library</h2>
<p>Working with Rust is like working with Javascript in many ways. While the package manager Cargo is truly awesome, the fact that the standard library misses most features will have you import many third-party dependencies. These dependencies in turn import other third-party dependencies, that import other third-party dependencies, and so on. This blow up of dependencies can quickly become a nightmare, and this is of course a perfect vector of attack for backdoors, like we've seen happen before in javascript land (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor">https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/05/npm-getcookies-backdoor</a>/, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds">https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-backdoors-popular-javascript-library-to-steal-bitcoin-funds</a>/).</p>
<p>Not only this, but if you're a newcomer to Rust, how do you even pick the right library? I can't even fathom how anyone writing a project in Rust gets to pick a good library for generating cryptographic random numbers, or for doing any type of crypto like encrypting or hashing, or for decoding hex strings, or for decoding JSON, or for using TCP, or even for using TLS! On the other hand Golang has all of that in its standard library, that means that when you use Golang you:</p>
<ul>
<li>can't pick the wrong algorithm (e.g. DES instead of AES)</li>
<li>can't pick a bad implementation (the standard library is known to be high quality) </li>
<li>can't pick a dependency that ends up importing plenty of other third-party dependencies (unlike Rust, the Golang standard library never imports third-party libraries)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about version updates (you're just updating your version of Golang instead of the versions of many dependencies)</li>
<li>don't have to worry about transitive dependencies that you can't update (again, Golang standard library doesn't rely on third-party dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>For <a href="http://libra.org/">Libra</a> we've used a number of techniques in order to reduce the number of third-party dependencies we use. This included figuring out when we used different dependencies that did the same thing, or figuring out what obscure dependencies we should avoid, we even re-wrote a large number of dependencies to avoid dependencies that ended up exploding the number of transitive third-party dependencies we imported. One useful tool we used for some of that is <a href="https://github.com/mimoo/cargo-dephell">dephell</a> which is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cargo-guppy">guppy</a>.</p>
<h2>Rustfmt is imperfect</h2>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is great, but <code>rustfmt</code> sucks. Why does it suck? Two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>it's not mandatory</li>
<li>it's configurable</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, Golang's compiler is very strict and will yell at you early on if you have dead code, unused dependencies, badly formatted code, and so on. It doesn't replace <code>gofmt</code>, but it's much more opinionated and is much more effective at making Golang's codebases more readable (especially if they forget to run <code>gofmt</code>). In addition, if you do use <code>gofmt</code>, you can't configure it! This is very apparent when you read Golang code, it always looks the same! And it is pretty fucking fantastic if you ask me, because not only Golang is easy to learn, but you can quickly get used to any Golang codebase due to the consistent formatting of the language.</p>
<h2>Too many ways to do things</h2>
<p>Rust has a somewhat different syntax from other languages of its genre, and you sometimes see things that you might not be used to see (statement as expression, match statements, lifetimes, etc.) I couldn't care less about these, these are things you can learn, and you end up getting used to them. What I can't get used to is the sheer number of ways to do something. There are so many keywords in Rust, and there's so many ways to end up bike shedding on the best way to write the exact same statement, that I consider it a waste of time. It's a waste of time for the developers, but also for the reviewers who will often run into keywords that they've never seen before. For example, there are too many ways to panic on purpose: <code>panic!()</code>, <code>unwrap()</code>, <code>except()</code>, <code>unreachable!()</code>, <code>todo!()</code>, <code>unimplemented!()</code>, <code>assert!()</code>, and so on. </p>
<h2>Generics and macros</h2>
<p>Rust is too expressive. This is of course great for some use-cases, but holy shit if a developer wants to be too clever, they can create the most unintelligible codebase that you'll ever seen. This is probably the most controversial point, but security is not just safety, it's also readability. As we say "complexity is the enemy of security", and generics undeniably add complexity. This is of course up to the developers to abuse them, but the great thing about Golang is that there aren't many things to abuse, codebases are often straight forward and you can quickly understand what is happening.</p>
<h2>Ok, you're being unreasonable David</h2>
<p>Sure, I'm omitting a lot of good Rust things in here, but this is a post about the security downsides of Rust, not the upsides, which let's be clear still make Rust the perfect language to write a sensitive application in. You just need to know what you're doing. This also means that Rust has a lot of room to mature, while generics are here to stay, there is no excuse to keep slipping the shallow stdlib under the rug.</p>

              <div>
<p>The year was 1983. Larry Ellison, over at a tiny company called Oracle, was focused on the fallout of a buggy database product rewrite. In the rearview mirror, catching up quickly, was computer science professor and eventual database legend Michael Stonebraker.</p><p>In his book, <em>Softwar</em>, author Matthew Symonds tells the story like so:</p><blockquote>Ellison was still not giving much of his attention to what was or wasn’t happening in sales. As far as Ellison was concerned, overwhelmingly the most important contribution he could make to Oracle’s success was to concentrate on making the product better. He simply didn’t regard himself as competent to concern himself with all the other things that a CEO is supposed to be responsible for. To some at Oracle, Ellison’s approach was one of enlightened delegation. “You could say that,” he says. “But it was closer to abdication than delegation.”<p>In fact, Ellison had every reason to concentrate on the product. Mike Stonebraker had taken the Ingres relational database project he had overseen at the University of California at Berkeley and formed a company around it called Relational Technology, Inc. Although a commercial version of Ingres had come to market a little later than Oracle, Stonebraker’s outfit was growing faster than Ellison’s. In 1984, Oracle’s sales had doubled to $12.7 million, while Ingres, as RTI was increasingly known, had tripled its sales to $9 million. Ellison says, “They were really kicking our butts. They were catching up fast because we had just rewritten our database product and we were having software quality problems. Sound familiar?”</p><p>The Berkeley team at Ingres had had much more time to refine their user language, QUEL, than Oracle had to develop SQL, and many relational experts thought it was intrinsically a superior language. Ellison says: “Maybe QUEL is better than SQL. Maybe French is better than English? It didn’t matter: English and SQL were going to win.” What Ellison was most worried about was the sheer engineering talent at Ingres. “It had become painfully clear to me that our development organization wasn’t good enough to keep up with the team at Ingres. So we had to rebuild it. If Stonebraker was hiring the best kids from UC Berkeley, we would hire the best kids from CalTech, MIT, and Stanford. We would also recruit the very best experienced programming talent in the Valley. In a real coup we hired a superb team from Xerox PARC. One of those guys, Derry Kabcenell, was among the most important people ever to work at Oracle. Thanks to Derry and the new engineering team he led, we overcame the software quality problems in Oracle Version 3. He delivered a superior database product—a product we could be proud of—a product that would kill Ingres. We called it Oracle Version 4.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this story is simplistic at best. Oracle Version 4 <em>was</em> a good product — certainly better than Oracle Version 3, which was released to the market with more bugs than a discarded pomelo. But it didn’t win because it was technically superior to Ingres. It won because IBM was powerful, and because Stonebraker made a mistake.</p><p>Later that year, after months of persuasion by IBM and Oracle, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) declared SQL the standard relational database language. Symonds writes:</p><blockquote>With the solidity of Version 4 and Oracle’s increasingly aggressive sales force, Ingres was hard pressed to maintain its momentum, but the real threat was the decision of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), supported by IBM, to declare SQL the standard relational database language. Mike Stonebraker of Ingres didn’t even bother to show up at the committee meeting to make the (quite strong) case for adopting QUEL because he was ideologically opposed to setting technology standards. It was the behavior of an intellectually arrogant academic rather than a prudent businessman protecting the interests of his company. Ellison says, “Stonebraker invented QUEL and stuck with it like a proud father, while IBM and Oracle supported the SQL standard. Lack of SQL support hurt Ingres badly. But so did lack of portability and read consistency. And Ingres had fallen far behind in performance. All this together conspired to kill off Ingres as a competitor in the database market.”</blockquote><h2>How good was QUEL, really?</h2><p>Symonds makes a passing remark in ‘many relational experts thought it was intrinsically a superior language’, but if anything that understates the degree with which QUEL was respected within the cluster of pioneers who invented the modern relational database.</p><p>In 1985, for instance, the year that QUEL and Ingres lost, database legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date">C.J. Date</a> — who worked on the relational model at IBM with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">Edgar Codd</a> (the <em>inventor</em> of said relational model) &nbsp;— wrote a paper in which he argued that QUEL was the superior of the two languages. </p><p>Why? The crux of the argument was that QUEL hewed closely to the relational calculus laid out by Codd, whereas SQL did not. QUEL was also a language that was designed thoughtfully; SQL was written by engineers who rushed an IBM database named System R to market, under immense pressure to prove that the relational database model could be a viable architecture for data storage systems (<a href="https://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~hugh/TTM/Importance-of-Column-Names.pdf">source</a>). It seems a little ridiculous today, but at the time, mainstream opinion believed that relational databases were nothing more than little toys. The System R engineers — and, in a few years, Larry Ellison over at Oracle — had their work cut out for them to prove that RDBMSes were the future. And so it was that the engineers who created SQL were focused on database performance, not language design, and they <em>never</em> expected the user interface they invented to take off and become a standard.</p><p>Well, ok, I hear you say, what are the problems with SQL? What’s wrong with drifting from the relational model as outlined by Codd?</p><p>I was involved in one such discussion late last year, with Thanh, the chief engineer at Holistics. “What do you think of SQL?” he asked, and I replied — as most classically-trained programmers do — “I think it’s ok. Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Oh I think SQL is flawed.”</p><p>“But Codd’s relational model —“</p><p>“Yes, Codd’s relational model is great. But, as an expression of that model, SQL is flawed.”</p><p>In a Slack comment he wrote (in a different context, and nearly one year later), Thanh explained:</p><blockquote>… The language (SQL) is not very composable. This is a fact that most SQL users are not aware of. The relational algebra that SQL is based on is <em>absolutely</em> composable but SQL is not due to the inherent limitation of the language (as it was designed to be natural language-like). When you write "select x from a where z", you are actually building something along the lines of "from a" =&gt; "where z" =&gt; "select x" in the algebra and you can actually compose each portion separately. If you are familiar with dplyr, Spark or pandas you would get this instantly.</blockquote><p>As far as I can tell, QUEL — which hewed more closely to Codd’s relational calculus — was <em>ridiculously</em> composable. We might have once lived in a world where QUEL and SQL would have continued to duke it out, and where the ‘best’ language might have found its own niches.</p><p>But alas, that isn’t how the world works. If the world worked differently, we wouldn’t still be writing on QWERTY keyboards, or speaking English; technically superior alternatives like Dvorak and Esperanto would have taken over. The world has since standardised on SQL, and the dreams of an alternate history exists only in the heads of those who had a hand in the early database wars. It was simply a quirk of history that System R was built within IBM, the single most powerful company in the computer industry at the time; it was a quirk that the engineers who built System R came up with a fiddly language interface as an afterthought, and it was a quirk that IBM then took that language and pushed it to become a standard … one that has lasted till today.</p><p>Of course, there was a silver lining to the whole saga. Stonebraker had forked the Ingres codebase in 1982 to create his company. Defeated by the bruising database wars of the 80s, he returned to Berkeley in 1985, and started a post-Ingres database project. Naturally, he named that database <em>post-</em>gres — as in, <em>after</em> Ingres.</p><p>And thus PostgreSQL was born.</p>

<p>Keeping your office tidy and organized might seem like a tedious task over
time, but when it comes to keeping the cables mess in order, it might seem even
harder.</p>
<p>But these small changes can make a dramatic improvement, by eliminating the
cable mess it will make your office look cleaner, more organized, and
productive, and also it will make managing those cables much easier.</p>
<p>The best solution to reduce the cable mess is by going wireless whenever
possible, many of today’s PC accessories are wireless, like the mouse,
keyboard, printer, headphones which can eliminate a good portion of cables on
your desk. But there are still some components that still require a cable
connection, like a power cord, monitor, USB cables, ethernet… etc. This is
where the art of cable management kicks in.</p>

<p>I met my wife when I was 15. She didn’t go to my school but she was friends with a girl I sat next to in math class. I was in an MSN chat room with that girl a few months later when my future wife joined. </p>



<p>Everything about my life ended up depending on moment. My kids, my career, my house, my wife, the college I went to, the car I drive, how I spend my free time, who I spend it with, the food I eat, the clothes I wear. Everything.</p>



<p>I would have gone to a different college and never found the CS course that decided my career path. I would be single or with someone that I wouldn’t like as much. Would I have different kids? What would they look like, those little strangers? Would they also argue about who gets to sit next to me on the couch?</p>



<p>Who knows where I’d be living, what I’d be doing, what I’d want out of life, what I’d be missing. </p>



<p>Who knows what I’m missing now?</p>



<p>And yeah I know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">the butterfly effect</a> is a thing that people have been talking about for decades. But this is my <em>life</em>. It’s all I’ve got. And everything about it came from my seat in math class and an afternoon when I was bored enough to join a chat room.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Sometimes life just slips in through a back door, and carves out a person and makes you believe it’s all true.</p><cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53GIADHxVzM">She Used To Be Mine</a>, Sara Bareilles</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Or should I go back further? Was it that my parents moved to a neighborhood zoned for that high school before I was born? Was it that my parents met each other in the first place, at the same college that I ended up going to? </p>



<p>There are so many things that had to happen <em>just so </em>to make us who we are. Too many things. How did I ever feel like I had power over my life, when it could be decided by a chat room on a bored Saturday afternoon in high school? How lucky am I to be happy with the life that chat room gave me?</p>

<p>When I was first asked to be a software engineering manager, I knew that saying yes would come with tradeoffs. On the one hand, it would be a chance to have more impact, mentor people, and develop my leadership skills. On the other, it was a job change: instead of solving technical problems myself, I would be helping others do the problem solving.</p><p>I said yes, and I’m happy I did. Being a manager has been rewarding. I like the variety of the job, being involved in a bunch of different things at once, and helping people. But I do miss the creativity and concreteness of building things myself. Some managers find time to code on the job, but for me it’s usually seemed more impactful to step back and focus on enabling others.</p><p>So, a year ago I decided to start a side project. It’s called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that allows users to create a personalized daily email with content from sources like RSS feeds, email newsletters, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and Hacker News. I built it to solve a problem in my own life, which was that there were a bunch of information sources I wanted to read every day, but they existed across platforms, and there wasn’t an easy way for me to keep up without getting sucked into a bunch of feeds and losing hours of my time.</p><p>Cortado has given me a chance to do what I missed from my job: writing and shipping code. And I do it with complete autonomy. I prioritize what to work on, design the UI, and talk directly to customers myself.</p><p>Now, I don’t miss doing this stuff at work as much, and -- to my surprise -- I think the side project is actually making me a better manager. I’m no longer as tempted to write my own code or unnecessarily inject my own taste into technical discussions. I can retain my identity of being someone who builds things without having to reinforce that identity in counterproductive ways at work. I can, in the words of Molly Graham, <a href="https://firstround.com/review/give-away-your-legos-and-other-commandments-for-scaling-startups/">“give up my legos”</a> without it feeling like a loss.</p><p>There have been other benefits. For one, working on Cortado has helped me stay up to date on technology. It has exposed me to Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, Docker, Heroku, React, and Webpack. Now, I can be prepared to contribute to discussions when these technologies are mentioned in a work context. Instead of faking my way through them, I can speak from a place of deep, experiential knowledge. </p><p>Another benefit is that I’ve increased my understanding of non-engineering jobs. With Cortado, I play the role of individual contributor, product manager, designer, customer support specialist, and marketer. This increases my empathy for people in these functions at work. I experience how hard it is to predict how long a bug will take to fix, how hard it can be to get simple things to work. So I remember to cut my reports slack when things take longer than expected. I experience how hard it can be to prioritize things when everything feels important, how there is often a direct short-term tradeoff between building things the right way and solving problems for customers. So I remember to empathize with product managers when we are discussing difficult tradeoffs. And I learn that without marketing there are no users. So I develop a deeper appreciation for the sales and marketing teams who ensure that I actually have a job.</p><p>Of course, nothing comes for free, and the cost of a side project is time. Not everyone wants to, or can, spend their time outside of work coding, designing, and marketing a side project. I have two small kids, and it’s important to me to spend lots of my non-work time with them. So making progress on a side project has required me to step up my time-management game significantly. For me -- to be honest -- this has mostly meant streaming fewer TV shows.</p><p>I’ve also had to be patient. I can only spend a few hours on the project each week, which means that progress goes more slowly than I want it to go. But in this case having kids probably helps: if they’ve done anything for me, they’ve helped me become more patient!</p><p>People often ask me if, as an engineering manager, I miss coding. I used to say yes but that the tradeoffs were worth it. That was true. But now I don’t need to hedge. I don’t miss coding because I don’t have to give it up. And the coding that I’m doing isn’t distracting me from being a better engineering manager. It’s helping.</p>

<p>This column was published in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121630">IEEE Software, The Pragmatic Designer column</a>, July-August 2020, Vol 37, number 4.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSTRACT:  The term <em>technical debt</em> was coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992.  In recent years, people have broadened the definition to include ideas not present in the original formulation, including lack of skill, expedient hacking, and obliviousness to software architecture.  By lumping these together, it’s harder to choose the right repair. This article proposes that we use the term <em>ur-technical debt</em> to refer to the original idea, which was:  When I build systems iteratively, my understanding of the problem and solution grow gradually, and inevitably my current thoughts do not match code I wrote earlier, so I must expend effort to fix that code, much like paying interest on a debt.</p>

<hr>

<p>These days, everyone uses the term technical debt.  It’s so prevalent that we shorten it to <em>tech debt</em> or even just <em>TD</em>.  What counts as technical debt has expanded over the years, which has caused many people to lose sight of the interesting phenomena that Ward Cunningham was talking about when he coined the term in 1992.  Today, any code that a developer dislikes is branded as technical debt.  Tech debt is also hacky code, code written by novices, code written without consideration of software architecture (so-called “big balls of mud”), and code with anti-patterns flagged by static analysis tools.</p>

<p>If you have never read Ward Cunningham’s original paper [1], you might be shocked to learn that it says tech debt originates from using iterative instead of waterfall development.  At the time, refactoring was not a widespread idea, so he invented the debt metaphor to explain to his manager that building iteratively gave them working code faster, much like borrowing money to start a project, but that it was essential to keep paying down the debt, otherwise the interest payments would grind the project to a halt.  That idea is quite different than what we call tech debt today.</p>

<p>It’s easy to understand why the definition has been broadened.  These other topics are worthy of study, they are technical, and the metaphor of debt applies.  Our community has accepted that tech debt is something to pay attention to, so saying an issue is a kind of technical debt is a way to draw people in.</p>

<p>When you set out to pay down your technical debt, having a narrow definition of technical debt is helpful because different ailments require different medicine, and lumping many ailments together makes it harder to choose the right medicine.  The momentum behind the current, broad definition is too strong to be turned back, so, by adding the prefix <em>ur-</em> that means “original”, I can refer to the narrower idea as <em>ur-technical debt</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-idea">The original idea</h2>

<p>What is the original idea, exactly?  Simply put, ur-technical debt arises when my ideas diverge from my code.  That divergence is inevitable with an iterative process.  The original paper connects your software process choices (waterfall or iterative) with financial concepts.  Given that you have some amount of time to build something, say a year, how can you use that time?</p>

<p>When you choose an iterative process, you use that time to deliver several partial solutions.  You don’t understand the full requirements until the last iteration, so for most of the year, the ideas in your head are partial.  The code embodies your partial understanding because it cannot be more insightful than the ideas in your head.  The original paper argues that this is ok, so long as you don’t leave the code in that state forever, and introduces the debt metaphor:  “Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.” [1]</p>

<p>When you choose the waterfall process, you are using the time to aim carefully and hit your target a year down the road.  Your ideas from the analysis phase match your code because you looked at all the requirements at once and wrote code just once.  The original paper says “working out a program in detail before programming begins … amounts to preserving the concept of payment up-front and in-full.”</p>

<p>Why put up with divergence or rework existing code when waterfall promises code aligned with ideas? Because a waterfall process only looks good if you believe that what you build will be flawless and the requirements will not change.  If either of those happen, then you need a second waterfall, which is just another name for very slow iterative development.</p>

<p>The original paper argued the point this way:  “We believe this process leads to the most appropriate product in the shortest possible time. … The modularity offered by objects and the practice of consolidation make the alternative, incremental growth, both feasible and desirable …”</p>

<h2 id="consolidation-is-critical">Consolidation is critical</h2>

<p>As you tackle new requirements, your understanding changes.  Ward Cunningham called this “consolidation” of ideas.  New abstractions emerge, either arising from better understanding of the problem or recognizing a more suitable design as the solution.  When using iterative development, this consolidation happens repeatedly across iterations.  “Mature sections of the [WyCash] program have been revised or rewritten many times providing the consolidation that is key to understanding and continued incremental development.” [1]</p>

<p>When we use iterative development, it’s inevitable that our ideas will evolve.  What’s not inevitable is that we change the code to match our ideas.  Some developers choose to leave existing code alone, following a process of code accretion, or to coin another term, <em>sedimentary development</em>.  For a while, you can apply brainpower to reason across the gap between what you understand compared to what you see in the code.  But your mind has limits and the greater the divergence, the worse you perform.  “[I]f you develop a program for a long period of time by only adding features and never reorganizing it to reflect your understanding of those features, then eventually that program simply does not contain any understanding and all efforts to work on it take longer and longer.” [2]</p>

<p>Choosing sedimentary development as a process is walking into a dead-end.  I often hear lip service to refactoring and expensive restructuring of code, but I rarely find teams that earnestly embrace Ward Cunningham’s advice.  Teams instead rely on developers reworking code on the side or as off-schedule work, not choosing to make refactoring part of their official process.  A software project that follows iterative development but has no process to restructure code is implicitly declaring bankruptcy as its exit strategy.</p>

<p>Companies often advise employees not to write anything in email that they would feel uncomfortable having read back on the witness stand in a trial.  That’s a vivid image that encourages clear communication that can’t easily be taken out of context and misunderstood.  It would be interesting to hear companies say the same thing about code, advising us not to check in code we’d feel uncomfortable being used to teach programming.  That might be exactly the vivid image we need to keep our ideas and code consolidated.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-about-hacking">It’s Not About Hacking</h2>

<p>Ward Cunningham is known for many ideas, not just technical debt.  You might know him as a ringleader in the Agile software development movement, or for his role in introducing patterns to software development, or for inventing the first wiki.  In 2011, the IEEE interviewed him for the Annals of the History of Computing and the topic of technical debt never came up [3].  However, the idea of technical debt has piqued the interest of the software community over the years, to the point where in 2009 he decided to post an explanation of what he meant by technical debt and contrast it with broader interpretations [2].</p>

<p>In that explanation, he says that technical debt is not bad code, code written by novices, or expedient hacks.  “A lot of bloggers at least have explained the debt metaphor and confused it, I think, with the idea that you could write code poorly with the intention of doing a good job later and thinking that that was the primary source of debt.”  By saying primary source, he’s leaving the door open that there is more than one source of debt, but he doesn’t open it much, as he continues with “I’m never in favor of writing code poorly, but I am in favor of writing code to reflect your current understanding of a problem even if that understanding is partial.”</p>

<p>If you knowingly write hacky code, or you allow inexperienced developers to use their first draft code, you undermine the very thing that makes iterative development viable.  “In other words, the whole debt metaphor, let’s say, the ability to pay back debt, and make the debt metaphor work for your advantage depends upon your writing code that is clean enough to be able to refactor as you come to understand your problem.”</p>

<p>The fascinating, surprising thing about ur-technical debt is that it happens even under the best circumstances, say with expert developers who always choose to fix debt immediately.  It’s inherent to using an iterative process and acting with a partial understanding.  Expanding the definition of technical debt to less ideal circumstances yields a completely unsurprising conclusion, that novices and hacking cause trouble on a project.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-about-decision-making">It’s Not About Decision Making</h2>

<p>These days, most everyone uses iterative development.  Once I start down that path, I am committed to creating technical debt because I am looking at partial requirements and writing code with partial understanding. Like Oedipus, my fate is sealed, and despite my best efforts and accumulated skills, I’m destined to want to gouge my eyes out when I look at my code in a future iteration.</p>

<p>The surprising insight is that doing this counter-intuitive thing – building a system based on partial understanding and fixing debt as I proceed – is better than using a …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-6f4ff34b=""><p><em>In this part 1 of 2 posts, I share the process of a heartwarming maker project built on top of Raspberry Pi and Rust. It's more a story than a how-to guide, but provides an interesting chronology of problems encountered. In part 2 I'll be getting technical and discussing Rust in-depth. Source code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/thefuntastic/rust-tide-clock" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a></em></p>
<p>I had the good fortune to spend my summer with Alice's family who had recently moved to a seaside town. Tim, the patriarch of the family, was distraught to learn that, out of his impressive array of nautical implements, his tide clock readings were never accurate. This is the story of how we built him a surprise 60th birthday present he'd never forget: </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-25-Tide-Clock-12.jpg" title="Picture completed Tide-Clock"></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-tides">The Problem with Tides</h2>
<p>Most people understand the moons gravitational pull causes a regular ebb and flow in water levels. Those concerned with the sea will likely recite 6 hours and 10-ish minutes as the duration between low and high tide. Consider a wristwatch or wall clock, most mechanical timepieces already track a daily period of 12 hours. With a small adjustment to gearing ratios, it would be easy enough to build a clock that reports instead the tidal cycle of 12 hours and 25 minutes. Indeed this is how most ornamental tide clocks work. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Wikipedia-Tide-clock.jpg" title="Picture of tide clock - Wikipedia"></p>
<p>I was surprised, however, to learn <a href="http://www.coastalwiki.org/wiki/Tidal_asymmetry_and_tidal_basin_morphodynamics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tides can be asymmetric</a>! Instead of six hours, it might take the tide seven hours to come in and five hours to go out again. Local environmental factors like the shallowness of an estuary basin can have a pronounced effect on tidal regularity. In extreme places, like the Gulf of Mexico, this can be enough to reduce the regular cycle from four tides a day to just two. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-25-Tide-Graph.png" title="WorldTides.info graph of tide station in the Gulf of Mexico showing asymmetry changing to produce single daily tide"></p>
<p>A disaster for the clockmaker! This asymmetry also changes with the lunar cycle, so it's not even possible for a mechanical clock to be consistently wrong. It makes intuitive sense if you think about it. Water is "stuff". When the tide changes that stuff has to go somewhere. If something makes it hard for stuff to move about, like say sandbars in a shallow basin, it's going to make the stuff pile up. The bigger the change in stuff, like say near spring tide, the more piling up is going to happen. If that stuff is still hanging about when the tide changes, the net effect is going to be an asymmetric tide.</p>
<h2 id="making-with-embedded-devices">Making with Embedded Devices</h2>
<p>To my mind, this was the perfect application for an internet-of-things powered device. By outsourcing the problem and fetching data from an API it meant the source of truth would always be accurate. Furthermore, a digital display could accurately visualise the asymmetric ebbs and floods.</p>
<h3 id="on-choosing-raspberry-pi">On choosing Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>Initially, I considered using an Arduino, as I already had one knocking about my toolbox, together with a compatible LED screen. Ultimately I chose the path of least resistance because the Raspberry Pi comes with an integrated WiFi chip. Unlike the Arduino, the Pi is a mini-computer running an entire operating system. This is the sledgehammer approach, but has advantages considering the project would eventually live in the hands of someone unfamiliar with embedded tech. If the WiFi connection were to drop or need changing, logging onto a desktop would be a much friendlier experience. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-21.jpg" title="Raspbian Desktop Interface running on Raspberry Pi"></p>
<p>Having settled on a Raspberry Pi build, the next job was to find a suitable display. Considering tides change relatively slowly, it was tempting to use an e-ink display for crazy power efficiency. That might be necessary if the clock was battery-powered, however, the need to keep the Pi running meant we were already committed to a plug-in power supply. In the end, I choose the 128x32 pixel <a href="https://thepihut.com/collections/waveshare/products/128x32-2-23inch-oled-display-hat-for-raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Waveshare 1305</a>. Its convenient "hat" form factor meant no soldering. Also, OLED looks crazy good compared to the standard LED screen I already had. </p>

<h3 id="on-choosing-rust">On Choosing Rust</h3>
<p>At this point, I was still unsure of which programming language to use. Whilst the Raspberry Pi can run anything that compiles to Linux, communication to the screen happens through the Pi's <code>GPIO</code> pins (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">General Purpose Input/Output</a>). All information is transmitted by setting pins high and low and feels reminiscent of working on Arduino and other embedded platforms. Even though the screen is just 128x32 (aka 4096) pixels, that's far more destinations than the Pi's 40 <code>GPIO</code> pins can individually address. Fortunately protocols, in this case <code>SPI</code>, exist to pack data into compressed blocks which can be sent over the limited bandwidth of the IO pins. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-31.jpg" title="Raspberry Pi 3 GPIO Pins"></p>
<p>The screen manufacturer-provided <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.23inch_OLED_HAT#Demo_codes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">3 code samples</a>: 1 written in python and 2 written in C. Python was my immediate choice, given the online nature of the project, however, I simply couldn't get it to work. The two C samples were curious. One was built on top of a bring-your-own driver for the embedded Broadcom chip that controls <code>GPIO</code> pins. The other was written on top of <a href="https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>wiringPi</code></a>, which ships with Raspbian (aka the Pi flavoured Linux OS) and seems to be the blessed path for doing IO. However, I was saddened to learn this open source project was largely the efforts of a single person who has since <a href="http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stepped down as a maintainer</a> due to open source burnout. It's a worrying trend I'm seeing a lot lately. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-4.jpg" title="Waveshare OLED screen showing Hello World"></p>
<p>Despite the above, the current <code>wiringPi</code> sample still works well. In theory I'm sure it would have been absolutely possible to complete the rest of the project in C. As a language though, C tends to come batteries-not-included. The prospect of stumbling my way through image processing, data parsing, fetching URLs and date-time munging did not fill me with joy, especially given my rudimentary C experience. I'd much rather be building sand-castles in a play pit that didn't require me to build my shovel first.  </p>
<p>I've been "Rust-curious" for a long time, and it's done a great job of establishing itself as <strong>an alternative for workloads where C was historically the only viable candidate </strong>(high performance or memory-constrained). That it does so without forsaking a first-class developer experience is one of the many reasons it's become such <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a beloved language</a>. Through the package manager, <code>cargo</code>, I'd have a thriving ecosystem of 3rd party libraries (aka crates) within arms reach. Indeed, I quickly found <code>rppal</code> (<a href="https://github.com/golemparts/rppal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi Peripheral Access Layer</a>), a Rust crate to manage <code>GPIO</code>.</p>

<p>There were also plenty of reasons <strong>not</strong> to choose Rust. Scant few weeks remained until the birthday party; if we were going to pull off the surprise it meant sticking to a very aggressive timeline. <code>rppal</code> is not a port of <code>wiringPi</code>, the <code>SPI</code> protocol implementation details might differ in subtle but fundamental ways, enough to bork the entire endeavour. Rust's borrow checker is infamously unforgiving to the uninitiated (it's a bit of an arsehole really). If I was being a responsible lead I'd probably command the troops to trudge on with C. But hack projects really should be about personal edification. So sod it, how hard could it be? </p>
<h2 id="programming-the-app">Programming the App</h2>
<p>Lets just say I got a beating, the likes of which demand a doughnut-shaped cushion afterwards. Rust's learning curve is notoriously steep, and hoping to grok it on such a tight schedule was perhaps optimistic. To Rust's credit, there are plenty of escape hatches to get yourself out of (or into) trouble. This is useful when writing your own code, but by consuming 3rd party libraries you're expected to be more fluent with "idiomatic Rust". </p>
<p><em>(Stay tuned for part 2 where I'll discuss my technical first impressions of Rust)</em>.</p>
<p>Idiomatic understanding is difficult to rush, as it requires a breadth of exposure. I'd fare better now, but as my first-touch point I simply couldn't figure out how I was meant to consume the <code>rppal</code> library. Combing the changelog revealed a big refactor towards a <strong>more</strong> idiomatic and Rust-like API. By reverting to an earlier <strong>less</strong> idiomatic version I'd found a cheeky get out of jail card. Breakthrough, at last, a single pixel signalled business time. </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-5.jpg" alt="The happiest pixel" title="Displaying single pixel"></p>
<h3 id="interface-and-ui">Interface and UI</h3>
<p>Now that drawing was possible, the next question was a matter of <em>what</em> to draw? In answer, I cracked open a pixel editor and performed a design sprint in miniature. Several iterations later I had a single image that served as my "design document". </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-6.jpg" title="Designing in the pixel editor"></p>
<p>That's a great example of why this project was so much fun. The problem space left room to flex muscles in every layer of abstraction, whilst being constrained enough to avoid becoming an onerous chore. Font rendering is another example. By using the old school technique of copying slices from a sprite sheet I didn't have to bother myself with font files or font rendering libraries.   </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-7.jpg" title="Designing the font. First on paper, then on screen"></p>
<p>To help me copy slices I relied on the <code>image</code> crate. Again there was a high degree of fumbling to get my head around the API, but once I did I was very impressed by the quality of the library. Even if the ecosystem is still technically maturing, the quality already on display announces Rust's arrival as a serious contender. </p>

    <div><p>Welcome to the Serverless world. One of the first things you’ll hear about is AWS Lambda - and you’ll continue to keep hearing about it! While architecture can be serverless without Lambdas involved, it’s very often the key component within a serverless application. In the first post of this 3-part AWS Lambda Handbook series, we run through what is AWS Lambda, dialling back to basics with the various terminology, how to create a Lambda function and how to run it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="what-is-aws-lambda-and-what-does-it-do">What is AWS Lambda, and what does it do?</h2>
<p>AWS Lambda is an event-driven serverless compute platform, spinning up the service in response to an event - find out more about Lambda triggers in <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/complete-guide-lambda-triggers-design-patterns-part-1/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/complete-guide-lambda-triggers-design-patterns-part-2/">part 2</a> of our Complete Guide to Lambda Triggers series. Your code simply sits there as a file while AWS keeps a lookout for the trigger event you’ve set. When that event occurs, your code is executed and the required operations are carried out. It’s deemed ‘serverless’ because the server doesn’t exist until the user goes out to look for it - this is the epitome of <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/what-is-faas-function-as-a-service/">Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)</a>.</p>
<p>Another bonus to Lambda is it’s auto-scalability managed by AWS, meaning you don’t need to think about infrastructure. The service will automatically accommodate growing needs and likewise, will scale down to conserve resources. All of this makes AWS Lambda a great solution to reduce waste of resources and budget.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="aws-lambda-definitions-explained">AWS Lambda Definitions Explained</h2>
<p>Before getting into how to set up and configure Lambda, below are definitions and terminology commonly used and spoken about.</p>
<p>Lambda Function: a group of related statements that perform a specific task in your application. It consists of code and any dependencies that are associated with it. Each Lambda function has its associated configuration information (name, description, entry point, and resource requirements).</p>
<p>The function itself has the following important aspects associated with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Trigger: A set of activities which invokes the function (runs the code you provide). The activity could be anything like a new object coming to your S3 bucket, a website or a service going down, an API call, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual function: This is the run-time code that constitutes the function. AWS supports Python, Node.js, C#, Go and Java8 as runtime environments.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources: Each function can be assigned certain Roles, which grants the function certain privileges such as reading S3 bucket contents, writing results to a database and so on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/1aws-lambda-api-gateway-trigger.png" alt="AWS Lambda anatomy" title="AWS Lambda anatomy"></p>
<p>The triggers are shown to the left, and in this case an API gateway trigger is active. The resources are shown on the right, which in this case, are CloudWatch Logs and DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Event Sources: an entity that publishes events. An event source can be an AWS service or developer-created application that produces events that trigger a function to run.</p>
<p>Invocation: an invocation is called up to execute a specific Lambda function. These are triggers for the code of the function to start running. Invocations can be either <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-options.html">synchronous or asynchronous</a>.</p>
<p>Event Source Mapping: a configuration of AWS services in which an event source is tied to a specific Lambda function. It enables automatic invocation of a Lambda function when specific events occur.</p>
<p>Lambda Execution Model: When you create a Lambda function, you can specify configuration information, such as the amount of memory and maximum execution time that you allow for your function. When that function is invoked, AWS Lambda launches an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/running-lambda-code.html">Execution Context</a> based on the configuration settings you have provided.</p>
<p>Cold Starts: A cold start happens when a Lambda function is invoked after not being used for an extended period of time, which results in increased invocation latency (more on this later).</p>
<h2 id="aws-lambda-configuration-elements">AWS Lambda Configuration Elements</h2>
<p>A Lambda function consists of the code and associated dependencies, and it also has configuration information within it. An API is also provided so you can update some of the configuration data. Lambda function configuration information comes with these critical elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calculating the required resources: specifying the amount of memory that you wish to allocate for your Lambda function. AWS Lambda allocates CPU power in proportion to the memory by the same ratio as a general-purpose AWS EC2 instance type, like an M3 type.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maximum execution time (timeout): specified to prevent the Lambda function from running non-stop. Since you’re paying for the AWS resources that are used to run your Lambda function, this is particularly important. Upon reaching the timeout, AWS Lambda is terminating the execution of your Lambda function. The recommended setting is valued upon the expected execution time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM role (execution role): the role that AWS Lambda performs on your behalf when executing a Lambda function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handler name: the method of entry point that runs your code with any event source dependencies included as a part of your Lambda function. You will be able to discover more details, and the quality features of monitoring and debugging AWS Lambda using this.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-simple-aws-lambda-function">Creating a Simple AWS Lambda Function</h2>
<p>Let’s create a simple Lambda function that is invoked by an API call, i.e. we generate a URL, which when entered in the browser would invoke the function. Our input would be passed into the function via this URL and the output would be returned and shown in the browser.</p>
<p>Step 1: Creating the function</p>
<p>In the Lambda console panel, click on create function. Give your function a name, in our case, it is DemoFunction. Also select the runtime as Python3, as we will be using that particular language for this example. Lastly, give your function’s role a name and, from Policy Templates, select Simple Microservice permissions.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/2creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda Author From Scratch" title="AWS Lambda Author From Scratch"></p>
<p>Click on Create Function and you will be taken to the next screen where you can provide the actual code. We are authoring this API from scratch, but there are tons of templates from Amazon repository that you can explore.</p>
<p>The next page will have an inline text editor with a simple python function in there. Replace that with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>import json

print('Loading function')

def lambda_handler(event, context):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstName = event['first']

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lastName = event['last']

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 'Greetings, ' + firstName + ' ' + lastName +'!' 
</code></pre><p>The first line is for parsing the JSON using the JSON library in Python. The lambda_handler function gets the event as one of its parameters; this event brings along a set of data. The first and second line inside the function extracts whatever data is labeled first and second, and stores them into the respective variables.</p>
<p>The last line returns a message back and that’s what we will see in our browser.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/3creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="Creating AWS Lambda function" title="Creating AWS Lambda function"></p>
<p>We can add an API Gateway trigger right here, but for the sake of clarity, let’s do it separately. For now, we can click Save and move into the testing phase.</p>
<p>Step 2: Testing your function</p>
<p>To test your function, just click on the top right corner where it says ‘TestEvent’, then click on Configure Test Event.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/4creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="Testing AWS Lambda function" title="Testing AWS Lambda function"></p>
<p>Here we will have our first encounter with a JSON payload. In the template TestEvent.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/5test-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="Testing AWS Lambda JSON function" title="Testing AWS Lambda JSON function"></p>
<p>Replace the file’s content with the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>{

&nbsp;&nbsp;"first": "Jane",

&nbsp;&nbsp;"last": "Doe"

}
</code></pre><p>Now that we have saved the test event. Click on Test in the previous menu. Upon successful execution you should see:</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/6creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda function output" title="AWS Lambda function output"></p>
<p>Step 3: Setting up a Trigger</p>
<p>As mentioned before, our user would <a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/what-are-aws-lambda-triggers/">invoke the function</a> by accessing a certain URL. To enable that go to the API Gateway Console under your AWS Services and click on Get Started or New API option.</p>
<p>Let’s create one from scratch:</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/7creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda API creation" title="AWS Lambda API creation"></p>
<p>Our API is named dashbird-api. After clicking on Create API. You will get the resources that the API has access to (listed in the next menu):</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/8creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda API resources" title="AWS Lambda API resources"></p>
<p>Since there are no resources, we just get a forward-slash. But you can create a new resource by using the Actions drop-down and picking Create Resource.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/9creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda child resources" title="AWS Lambda child resources">
In the resource list, you can select this new resource (named greetings), click on actions and select Create Method. Our HTTP request method is going to be a GET request since our aim is to get an appropriate response from invoking the function.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/91creating-new-aws-serverless-function.png" alt="AWS Lambda GET request" title="AWS Lambda GET request"></p>
<p>The method will have a Lambda integration option, select that and then enter the function name chosen by you earlier Step 2. Also, from Step 2’s screenshot, make note of the function’s <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-cloud/arn-amazon-resource-names/">ARN</a> (top-right corner), it has the string eu-central-1 indicating the region it is in. Make sure that the same region is selected for the Lambda region also, as shown above. It would then ask permission for invoking the function; grant that and now we are ready for the final modification.</p>
<p>The GET method execution is explained in this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/92-GET-method-execution-aws-serverless.png" alt="AWS Lambda modify method" title="AWS Lambda modify method">
We still need to make sure that the input parameters are passed on correctly. For that we need to modify the Integration Request stage from above. You can click on it to make modifications:</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/93-GET-method-execution-aws-serverless.png" alt="AWS Lambda body mapping" title="AWS Lambda body mapping"></p>
<p>Leave everything as it is, except at the very bottom of the menu where you will find the Body Mapping Template here we get to describe our input template.The template is going to be of type application/json :</p>
<pre><code data-lang="{">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"first": "$input.params('first')",

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"last": "$input.params('last')"

}
</code></pre><p>The dollar sign and the input.params() part act as a placeholder and helps us define the structure of a proper request. Now we can save our changes, and click on Actions and select Deploy API option. It will ask for a stage name; give it a suitable name (in our case it is called prod). All is set! We can now run this function in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-function">Running the Function&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The function can be invoked using a unique URL associated with it. In the API console, where we first selected Resources, select Stage submenu instead. Then drop down to greetings and then to the GET option.</p>
<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/94-GET-method-execution-aws-serverless.png" alt="AWS Lambda invoke URL" title="AWS Lambda invoke URL"></p>
<p>It will give you an invoke URL, which you can click on for the function to run. However, on the first try you might get an error message if you didn’t give any input. You can rectify this by modifying the URL like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://.........amazonaws.com/prod/greetings?first=John&amp;last=Doe">https://.........amazonaws.com/prod/greetings?first=John&amp;last=Doe</a></p>

<p><img src="https://dashbird.io/images/blog/2020-05-vacation-buffer/93-GET-method-execution-aws-serverless.png" alt="AWS Lambda body mapping" title="AWS Lambda body mapping"></p>
<p>Leave everything as it is, except at the very bottom of the menu where you will find the Body Mapping Template here we get to describe our input template.The template is going to be of type application/json :</p>
<pre><code data-lang="{">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"first": "$input.params('first')",

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"last": "$input.params('last')"

}
</code></pre><p>The dollar sign and the input.params() part act as a placeholder and helps us define the structure of a proper request. Now we can save our changes, and click on Actions and select Deploy API option. It will ask for a stage name; give it a suitable name (in our case it is called prod). All is set! We can now run this function in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-function">Running the Function&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The function can be invoked using a unique URL associated with it. In the API console, where we first selected Resources, select Stage submenu instead. Then drop down to greetings and then to the GET option.</p>

<p>It will give you an invoke URL, which you can click on for the function to run. However, on the first try you might get an error message if you didn’t give any input. You can rectify this by modifying the URL like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://.........amazonaws.com/prod/greetings?first=John&amp;last=Doe">https://.........amazonaws.com/prod/greetings?first=John&amp;last=Doe</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naara-abril-taker/">Abril Taker</a> - Content Creator at <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=best-onboarding&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a></em></p><p>Great onboarding emails don't need to have impressive design. They should provide a clear path for new users to follow to get as much value from your product and as quickly as possible. While creating <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=best-onboarding&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra's</a> onboarding, we went through our favorite plain text emails. Here's what we learned.</p><h2>Plain text is the way to go 🚀</h2><p>Writing HTML emails takes a lot of time, even with image based builders. As an early stage company, we simply didn't have enough time to design and mark our emails.</p><p>We also have <a href="https://blog.palabra.io/plain-text-engagement">a lot of reasons to go with plain text</a> instead of image-based. It helps deliverability, accesibility and looks much more real and important than ad-looking emails.</p><p>That's why we decided to go with plain text emails all the way. We explored different email sequences that used plain text (or simple styling) to understand what they did best. And where better to start than our very own inbox?</p><p>We noticed a few of the onboarding email sequences we got were really helpful for us as users. They kept simple a simple design and used mostly text to share their best features. </p><p>And we found some awesome examples of onboarding sequences that use little to no HTML styling:</p><ul><li>Notion's awesome and personal onboarding (simple styling).</li><li>Superhuman's daily bits of information on its greatest features (only text and images).</li><li><a href="http://zest.is/">Zest.is</a> drips using only plain text and images or gifs (our personal favorite).</li></ul><p>Here's what we discovered.</p><h2>Welcome emails are more than a confirmation</h2><p>Every SaaS company must start their onboarding sequences with a welcome message that is sent when a user joins the platform. This is a must by now, since everyone who signs up will expect some sort of confirmation of their transaction.</p><p>I mean, it is essentially a welcome message, but it can be so much more.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Image" title="Image" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/7cbe707b1b06d73390376c23df182939/f0157/01.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/7cbe707b1b06d73390376c23df182939/5243c/01.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/7cbe707b1b06d73390376c23df182939/ab158/01.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/7cbe707b1b06d73390376c23df182939/f0157/01.png 809w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>For example, SuperHuman sends you a warm welcome message that immediately teaches you how to use their Command.</p><p>Another excellent example of welcome email is from Zest:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Image" title="Image" src="https://blog.palabra.io/static/484d998ef2ecfebe45feeffb359a512e/7d769/02.png" srcset="https://blog.palabra.io/static/484d998ef2ecfebe45feeffb359a512e/5243c/02.png 240w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/484d998ef2ecfebe45feeffb359a512e/ab158/02.png 480w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/484d998ef2ecfebe45feeffb359a512e/7d769/02.png 960w,https://blog.palabra.io/static/484d998ef2ecfebe45feeffb359a512e/b1884/02.png 994w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>We love these simple but catchy lines. They nail the exact effect that plain text should achieve: make you feel among friends.</p><p>Both Superhuman and Zest suggest a next step you should follow after receiving that first email. This gives a clear path for people to follow if they want to get value from their products. And that's the best thing you can do with a welcome message.</p><h2>A name and a face</h2><p>This is a great tip to increase engagement. I always feel awkward when I don’t know who is writing on the other side. Is it the CEO? Someone from Sales? Is it a super intelligent baby? Who knows.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>We can see this information clearly in Notion’s emails. Ivan is not only a name, he is Notion’s Co-founder. It’s flattering to receive a direct message from a co-founder, it also gives the impression of commitment from the very roots of the company. </p><p>At <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=best-onboarding&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a> we do the very same thing. Our emails are sent by Paula or Karen, who are the founders (and the heart) of this project. </p><p>A photo is not a requirement in itself, yet, the clearer the image we have of the person who sends and receives the emails, the more engagement we can generate.</p><p>Even if you have hundreds of people working in your business, you can create an identity to address your users.</p><h2>Emojis in the subject (use with caution)</h2><p>This point is more to talk about email subjects, a very important topic that sometimes is forgotten.</p><p>If every email is a gift to your users, the subject is the wrapping paper. You want it to be shining, flashy, stunning so the reader has no other option than to open the email.</p><p>Definitely, most of the plain text onboarding sequences than we observed have emojis (at some stage) in their subjects. </p><p>Remember: emojis are important, but they have to reinforce the idea of the text in the subject. Otherwise you’re gonna look cu-cu or, even worse, desperate.</p><p>Zest win the contest of better subjects seding thing like: </p><ul><li>you here -&gt; 💗</li><li>make yourself at home 🍋</li></ul><p>You can also include them in the body of the email to generate a greater visual impact and a neatear appearance.</p><h2>Email 'til you make it</h2><p>Yes, we received tons of emails per week. In fact, Superhuman mentioned it in their onboarding email sequence.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><em>(this is simply genius)</em></p><p>But preciscely for that reason you have to be present. The first days are critical to impress your users.</p><p>Zest has the strategy of sending an email the first day a user joins. And then three more during the second day, another 4 days after and another one 10 days after.</p><p>Imagine someone you’re dating sends you 4 emails in 10 days (well, in that case, you’re probably Meg Ryan, so maybe it’s not so bad).</p><p>This could sound excessive, but it can take a while until people understand your value. Just make sure the value you're providing is clear, and that each email you send has a reason to be in people's inbox.</p><h2>Thank yous matter</h2><p>Far from recommending you stalk your users, we want to encourage you to use emails as a tool for a meaningful exchange of information. You can learn one thing or two about your own service or product.</p><p>The Superhuman sequence puts feedback as a priority, using sentences like:</p><p>“<strong>We love hearing your feedback: please reply to this email and say hello :)”</strong></p><p><strong>“We love hearing from you! Please reply and let us know what you think 😃”</strong></p><p>In the email sequence that we mentioned from Zest, at the 10 day after the user joins, they ask for the thoughts and feelings about the platform and for the likes and dislikes.</p><p>A “thank you” at the end of every email leaves a good impression. Of course. It’s also a good idea to make a special thanking email. When a business is growing, every user is something to thank, so let them know that in your own words (or emojis!).</p><p>If you read this far, ping us at <a href="https://twitter.com/palabraio">Twitter</a> and tell us who sent you your favorite onboarding emails.</p><hr><p>Hope you enjoyed this post!

              <h4>Simple and middleweight</h4>
              <p>The most straightforward 35kb of CSS possible. No gzipping. No tree-shaking.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Less to remember</h4>
              <p>Easy class names, taken mostly from CSS, with no abbreviations or numbers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Fun to read&nbsp;and&nbsp;write</h4>
          <p>It sounds like caveman talk. Piece together your site with CSS grunts.</p>

      </div>

      <p>CSS frameworks have a Goldilocks problem.</p>
      <p>The first type of framework is the ultra-thin CSS file. You download it, enjoy the small file size and codebase, and then it's all downhill from there. The tiny file eventually becomes a bloated, unorganized mess, or the preamble to a bloated, unorganized mess.</p>
      <p>The second type of framework takes the opposite approach, including everything under the Sun. These frameworks will usually rely on advanced tools to chisel away at a CSS monolith, only keeping the classes a project is actively using.</p>
      <p><img src="https://cavepaint.github.io/cavepaintcss/caveman_spear.svg"></p><p>Both of these approaches suffer from <em>too little</em> or <em>too much</em>. They're both wrong ideas about what makes CSS good for a project.</p>
      <p>Cavepaint CSS is designed to be <strong>just right</strong>. Weighing in at around 35kb, it's not going to win any minimalist CSS prizes. On the other hand, there's no fat to trim, no esoteric classes to pull out and no workflow to configure. There's no tree-shaking or gzipping to be done. It's just normal CSS readable by both humans and machines.</p>
      <p>Cavepaint doesn't get bloated because it already has so much of what you need. It doesn't need a chisel because it doesn't start out ridiculously huge.</p>
      <p>Cavepaint CSS is the CSS you need, for any project, right now.</p>

      <h3>Some quick examples:</h3>

          <pre>&lt;button <strong>class="huge dark green"</strong>&gt;Click!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

        <div>
          <pre>&lt;div <strong>class="golden two-column small"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;div <strong>class="small black video placeholder"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Video&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Video description&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        
        </div>
        
      </div>



      <div>
        
        <div>
          <pre>&lt;div <strong>class="three-column white responsive padding no-margins text-center"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;div <strong>class="green border-radius"</strong>&gt;&amp;check;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div <strong>class="green border-radius"</strong>&gt;&amp;check;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div <strong>class="red border-radius"</strong>&gt;&amp;cross;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        
        </div>
        
      </div>

      <div>
        
        <div>
          <pre>&lt;div <strong>class="dark cobalt texture inset rounded"</strong>&gt;
  &lt;p <strong>class="info gutter text-padding border thick"</strong>&gt;
    This is important!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So you’ve decided that you’d like to start consulting. Maybe you’ve heard the siren call of setting your own hours, working on cutting edge stuff with cool clients, making more money, or making a name for yourself. Perhaps you’ve read some of the interesting outcomes that folks like <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/money-or-wealth">Nat Eliason</a> have talked about at length. Freelancing, contracting, consulting - whatever you want to call it. Offering your own services is a great first step in the ladder of self-employment. </p>
<p>There’s a ton of reasons why being a consultant might work for you. One of the great things about starting your own consulting business is that it doesn’t require a big outlay of cash. Starting a consulting business can be accomplished fairly simply by finding businesses that need help with a specific challenge and offering them your help solving that problem. </p>
<p>That said, simple definitely doesn’t mean easy. The low barriers to entry also mean that consulting is fiercely competitive. Ever looked at sites like Upwork, Fiverr, or Freelancer? <em>Dozens of highly skilled people around the world are willing to take on contracts at much lower rates than you’d ever accept.</em> Tons of people try to become self employed as a consultant every year and just as many quit because they can’t make it work.</p>
<p><strong>So the question is, how do you succeed early on as a consultant?</strong> For the sake of this post, I’ll assume you don’t already have an established brand that you can fall back on or an incredible personal network capable of feeding you awesome leads. As we'll find out, succeeding as a consultant is actually more about not failing, hence the title of this post. Failing usually happens because you aren't able to sell your services.</p>
<p>I’m going to give you a process you can use to get off the ground running. We’ll try to avoid vague platitudes and instead focus on the actionable steps that you can take to give yourself the best chances of success. </p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-hire-you"><a href="#why-should-i-hire-you" aria-label="why should i hire you permalink"></a>Why Should I Hire You?</h2>
<p><strong>Consulting is only about one thing: improving the client’s state.</strong> In order to improve a client’s state, they’ll first need to agree to work with you. In order to get them to work with you, they’ll first need to understand your value proposition and agree with it.</p>
<p>Ok, value proposition - <em>vague buzzword alert</em>. What does it mean? The simplest version of this is a statement taking the form: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><span size="6">I help <b><i>who</i></b> do <b><i>what</i></b></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems easy enough? Not really. The key to a compelling value prop is to get as specific as possible about the answers you are filling in for the who and what.</p>
<p>Also critically - and I can’t stress this enough - you are not just making up answers to this that sound good in your head. You want to get laser focused on understanding exactly who your customers are and exactly what their pain points are. You are NOT focusing on the technical skills you have or features of the solution. </p>
<p>The fatal error many aspiring consultants make is to come up with something like this: “I help ecommerce companies to build machine learning models”. Wrong - no one gives a crap about your ability to build fancy ML models. Selling yourself as a list of technologies or credentials completely exposes your lack of understanding about who should care and why. </p>
<p>Potential clients care about you only in your ability to solve their problems, save them time, and make more money. Anything not directly accomplishing this is a complete waste of time for you to try to sell. Instead of obsessing over anything technical or logistical, focus on how you can improve the client’s life.</p>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions to get closer to what I’m describing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pain Point</strong>: What is your client’s important problem that they can’t solve?</li>
<li><strong>Imagine</strong>: Where could your client be at the end of this journey with you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s walk through methods you might use to develop your value proposition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about past jobs you’ve had. The company you worked for had customers, otherwise they wouldn’t be in business. Those customers have a pain point that they were willing to pay to solve. <strong>Could you help those customers solve that pain point directly?</strong></li>
<li>Have you or anyone you’ve worked with ever complained about something relating to your work? Chances are, other people have complained about that thing too. <strong>Is there a way for you to make that situation less bad for people like yourself or your coworkers?</strong></li>
<li>Ask people what their biggest professional challenges or annoyances are. Simple. Effective.</li>
<li>Are other people selling solutions to the pain points you are planning on solving as well? If not, try again. Why? If it is a real pain point, businesses should already be paying to have it solved. <strong>Sell what sells.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-subtle-art-of-selling-services"><a href="#the-subtle-art-of-selling-services" aria-label="the subtle art of selling services permalink"></a>The Subtle Art of Selling Services</h2>
<p>Ok so you’ve made it this far. Let’s say you have a solid value proposition. You’re ready to start working with clients. Congrats. Now here is the painful truth (you’ve earned the right to hear it):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span size="4">All your other efforts mean nothing in comparison to your sales efforts.... including actually doing the work that you are selling.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Consulting is a sales game.<span> Eventually starting any business is a sales game. Don’t like it? Don’t start a business.</span></span></p>
<p>Let’s assume you’re ok with this and move onto optimizing your sales efforts so you don’t flounder around aimlessly like most (myself included) did when they started.</p>
<p><strong>Getting your first leads consists of getting leads.</strong> Huh? That means not making content. It means pounding the pavement and reaching out to real human beings who hold the bag (of cash). Make cold calls. Send cold emails. Make warm calls to people you know asking them for leads. Send warm emails doing the same. Find any way that you can to get in touch with business owners (the people who actually care about the success of their business) and get talking to them.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to find a clever way to avoid outbound sales. But at the start, there is no other way. Nothing will put dollar bills in your pocket faster than talking to people who own money making machines (businesses) and convincing them to let you solve their problems. No, it is not scalable. But it will keep you afloat, and at this stage that’s all you should care about. </p>
<p>Selling is really hard. The reason being because it is mostly rejection. Being aware of that in advance should help you to mentally deal with it a little, but it will still suck somewhat. Trust the process. Remember that people really only buy 4 things: time, money, sex, and approval. If you try selling something other than those things you will fail. Every proposal and pitch you make should be framed around one of those things. Try to sell solutions to current problems rather than future problems. People buy aspirin more than they buy vitamins.</p>
<p>When you start prospecting for clients, your aim should be targeted on people who buy services. Those are the only people whose opinion matters and who you want to talk to.  Likely they go by the titles of owner (ideal because they have the most skin in the game), manager, director, or executive. </p>
<p><code>Don’t accept a “no” from someone who can’t say “yes”.</code> </p>
<p>The “yes” people are the people we just listed. There are many people who can only say no, including HR, recruiting, and any managers without buying power. It’s okay to go around these folks. Most of their job could be in saying no. You know that you can help this company improve! People who don’t have a vested interest (read: ownership) in the business succeeding likely don’t have any reason to change the status quo. It’s about finding the people who are most incentivized to optimize their business’ profitability and asking them the right questions to see how you can provide value. </p>

<p>Being useful to other people is all you ever need to do to sell things. Help people out. Send interesting content. Write nice cards that show you care. Record videos sharing your ideas for growing their business. Introduce people who would benefit from knowing each other then get out of the way. Don’t expect anything in return for these efforts. Be consistent and authentic about these actions. The reason why you’d do this is because most people think sales pitches are repulsive. Being immediately helpful is attractive. If you find a way to help someone before they are paying you, they will find ways to pay you back. Of course, these tips aren't specific to just consulting but since relationships are the lifeblood driving your services business, the advice is extra relevant for you.</p>

<p>Ok so you’ve got a contract or two by now. In future posts I’ll dive deeper into things like negotiating rates, contracts, and the actual project delivery. For today, I’m assuming you’re a pro in your niche and so once you’ve got a contract the actual project delivery goes fine. Generally that’s not what makes consulting businesses fail.</p>
<p>As a general tip for contract-based service work, make sure that you understand the requirements really well before starting any implementation. Talking to all stakeholders and having a clear picture of what would constitute success is a make-or-break thing. As the project progresses, communicate frequently about any new developments, doubts, opportunities, or questions you might have. When in doubt, over communicate with your client and make sure you are on the same page. Things will never be perfect and if you are proactive about calling issues out, you will bring extra value to the table by acting as a project manager and by solving problems before they even arise. Your client will appreciate not feeling like they have to micromanage you and you will have more breathing room. Win-win. <strong>Above all else, do what you said you will do - it is rare in this business.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> is famously unintuitive. This post starts with an extreme version where the solution is blindingly obvious. We then go through a series of small changes. It will be clear that these don’t affect the solution. At the end, we arrive at the classic Monty Hall problem.</p>

<p>For reference, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">classic formulation</a> goes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, many people guess it doesn’t matter if you switch. But it does. You get the car 2/3 of the time if you switch, and 1/3 of the time if you don’t. Why?</p>



<p>Here’s our first game.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game1.png">
</p>

<p>There’s nothing mysterious here. You should choose option B. There’s only a 10% chance you picked the right door, so there’s a 90% chance the car is behind one of the others.</p>



<p>Now, we slightly update the game (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty says “Hey! I promise you that there is a goat behind at least 8 of the other 9 doors!”</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game2.png">
</p>

<p>Monty’s statement changes nothing. You don’t need to rely on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall#/media/File:Monty_hall_abc_tv.JPG">trustworthy looks</a>. You already <em>knew</em> there were at least 8 goats! Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>



<p>Let’s update the game again (new part in bold).</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li><strong>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 with goats behind them, and opens them.</strong></li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind all of the other 9 doors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game3.png">
</p>

<p>The key insight is this: When Monty shows you that 8 of the 9 other doors contain goats, you haven’t learned anything relevant to your decision. You <em>already knew there were at least 8 goats behind the other doors</em>! So this is just like game 2. Option B still gets you the car 90% of the time.</p>

<p>Want more intuition? Suppose you picked door 3. Imagne Monty walking past the doors, opening doors 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, <strong>skipping 7</strong>, then opening 8, 9, and 10. Doesn’t door 7 seem special?</p>



<p>Let’s make another change. Finally, we arrive at a game very similar to Monty Hall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are 10 doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other 9.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other 9 doors. He chooses 8 of them with goats behind them, and opens them.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind <strong>the other closed door</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game4.png">
</p>

<p>The only difference with Game 3 is that option B doesn’t get you the 8 visible goats. Since you don’t care about goats, this makes no difference. This is still just like the game 3. You get the car 90% of the time by switching.</p>



<p>Here is the last game. We just change the number of doors from 10 to 3.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There are <strong>3</strong> doors. A car is randomly placed behind one, and goats behind the other <strong>2</strong>.</li>
  <li>You pick one door.</li>
  <li>Monty looks behind the other <strong>2</strong> doors. He chooses one <strong>1</strong> of them with a goat behind it, and opens it.</li>
  <li>You get two options:
    <ul>
      <li>Option A: You get whatever is behind the door you picked.</li>
      <li>Option B: You get whatever is behind the other closed door.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/monty-hall/game5.png">
</p>

<p>Of course, you still want to choose option B. The chance of success is now 2/3 instead of 9/10. This game is exactly Monty Hall, so we’re done.</p>



<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s important that Monty looked behind the doors before choosing which to open. This is where people’s intuition usually fails. If he had chosen a door at random — <em>in a way that he risked possibly exposing a car</em>, then the situation would be different. (In that case, there’s no advantage or harm in switching.) But he doesn’t choose the door at random. He deliberately chooses to show you goats. Since this is always possible, it tells you nothing. I think this is the crux of what makes this problem unintuitive. Many people intuitively think it doen’t matter if you switch. And that <em>would be correct</em> if the door had been opened at random!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It might be helpful to draw a diagram of the relationship of the different games, starting with classic Monty Hall and ending with the extreme version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Game 5 (Classic Monty Hall)<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Use 10 doors instead of 3)<br>
 ↓ <br>
Game 4<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (If you switch, get the contents of <em>all</em> other doors, not just the other closed door.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 3<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty promises 8 goats behind the other doors instead of showing you.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 2<br>
 ↓<br>
 ↓ (Monty doesn’t bother promsising.)<br>
 ↓<br>
Game 1 (Dyno Might© Monty Hall)</p>

    <p>There are <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2019/09/the-intuitive-monty-hall-problem.html">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jben0/status/1174180200072011776">other</a> <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/19/alternative-more-intuitive-formulation-of-monte-hall-problem/">attempts</a> at <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/96826/the-monty-hall-problem/3360686#3360686">variants</a> of the Monty Hall problem, also intended to be more intuitive. These involve switching the doors for “boxers”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monty Hall was actually named “Monte” at birth! Given that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulations</a> are often used for exploring the Monty Hall problem, that’s either a tragedy for puns or a miracle for confused students.</p>

Productionize your programming languages</h3></p><div data-css="tve-u-174edc4b961"><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">When you are on-call for a service written Java is going to be a bit different than in PHP or Go. A lot of it depends on the ecosystem too. You need to have well-built frameworks, libraries, and tools. Some of the frameworks or libraries are heavier than others, some of them are harder to instrument and operationalize. Let's look at some questions that can point us into the right direction:</p><ul><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How long does it take a typical app to start?&nbsp;</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How much memory / CPU app requires without any load?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>What's the max load it can handle?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How do resources look at max load?&nbsp;</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How does it behave when the load goes over the top?</em></li></ul><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">These are some of the crucial questions you need to have a quick way to know.&nbsp;<span data-tt="{}">You should have a ready-made dashboard for this, which is just a click away, to separate you from organizations that have no clue from ones that do.&nbsp;</span>Knowing the behavior is crucial to<strong>&nbsp;identify and fix the problem <strong>quickly</strong>. </strong>Looking at your dashboard, you should be able to clearly identify that app is not starting up vs being overloaded.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">Typically there are a lot of differences between how programming languages handle memory and concurrency. Go provides lightweight threads and garbage collection. Python has a global interpreter lock. Java has virtualized everything with a JVM. PHP relies on web server to do most of the work. Some of the important questions in this space are:</p><ul><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>What are the key indicators that show you have a memory leak?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>Does it have a garbage collection?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em>How does concurrency work in that language?</em></li><li data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962"><em><span data-tt="{}">Does one of your app threads or goroutine leaks?</span></em></li></ul><p data-css="tve-u-174edc4b962">It should be relatively easy for you to identify problems with GC, or a memory leak.&nbsp;<span data-tt="{}">By simply looking at your premade dashboard and see some graph spiking.</span></p></div></div>

For example, you are hosting an FTP server. Most of the open-source servers are written well before Prometheus was a thing, and therefore those open-source servers don't expose any metrics. The most straightforward way to monitor this case is to use <strong>Blackbox monitoring approach</strong>. Just run an app, which constantly connects to your application and imitates some user behavior. For FTP, it could be putting or reading a file. For web app it could be a simple HTTP request or a complicated user flow.</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">It's super important as sometimes white-box metrics just don't work. One example is when a service is overloaded, or stuck in a garbage collection loop. The application won't have enough resources to send the metrics..</p><p data-css="tve-u-174ede01bb7">Blackbox metrics are typically relatively easy to setup. It also makes sense to alert on this.

The application was super slow and not responding, but we couldn't figure out why in time. After a couple of hours, it came back to life, without us really doing anything. Digging deeper into metrics, we found that CPU limits were too low, which caused significant CPU throttling.&nbsp;<strong>We probably lost some customers during that day, but we learned a lot from this.</strong></p></div></div>

<p>
In this article, we're only measuring the performance on the CPU. Both libraries,
Deep Diamond, and Keras with TensorFlow use <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">Intel's oneDNN</a> low level performance
library under the hood, and I confirmed that both installations exploit AVX2 instructions that are
available on my (old-ish) CPU i7-4790k, so the difference is completely due to the higher-level implementations.
</p>

<p>
Deep Diamond completes this training in <b>368</b> seconds while Keras + TensorFlow takes <b>509</b> seconds.
</p>

<p>
TensorFlow is not famous for being the fastest deep learning library, but
keep in mind that that info is from the times before they integrated
Intel's oneDNN. Now that all major frameworks have oneDNN support,
the underlying performance is usually on more equal footing.
</p>

<p>
That's why this result is good. Even though all high performance
operations are backed by the same native operations, Keras + TensoFlow
still add 140 seconds of overhead, almost 50% to Deep Diamond's running time. Not bad!
</p>

<p>
I know what you'll complain about: "Nobody trains their networks on
CPU anyway. The GPU performance is what is relevant! Clojure certainly
can't challenge TensorFlow there?" You're right about the first part;
GPU performance is much more relevant. Let's keep the suspense then,
until the next article, which will compare Deep Diamond to Keras + TensorFlow on the GPU with CUDA.

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction</h4><p>A few weeks ago, I came across a <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2020/07/05/how-predictable-is-fiction/">blog post entitled “How predictable is fiction?”</a>.&nbsp;The author, Ted Underwood, attempts to measure the predictability of a narrative by relying on BERT’s next sentence prediction capabilities. Novels from genres that traditionally rely more heavily on plot conventions such as thriller or crime should be more predictable than more creative genres with unpredictable (to the reader and the model) plotlines – at least in theory.</p><p>The idea got me thinking that it might be possible to develop a similar measure for the predictability of writing style by relying on another task BERT can be trained on, masked language modeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In lay language, masked language modeling can be described as a fill-in-the-blanks task. A model is given a sentence, a token in the sentence is hidden (replaced by a token like <code>[MASK]</code>) and the model made to predict it using the surrounding context words. The idea is that we can use the probabilities generated by such a model to assess how predictable the style of a sentence is. For instance, in the following English language sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>His hair as gold as the sun , his eyes blue like the [MASK].</p></blockquote><p>BERT (trained on English language data) can predict&nbsp;<code>sky</code>&nbsp;with a 27% probability. But in this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>The [MASK] above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel</p></blockquote><p>the probability of&nbsp;<code>sky</code>&nbsp;falls much lower, with BERT instead giving tokens such as&nbsp;<code>screen</code>,&nbsp;<code>window</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>panel</code>&nbsp;the highest probabilities – since the comparison to television makes the presence of the word less predictable. The probabilities returned by BERT line up with what we typically associate with literary originality or creativity. It can assess the&nbsp;“preciosity” of a word: given two synonyms, the rarer one will receive a lower probability. A low probability can also reflect the unexpectedness of the type of comparisons used in literary or poetic language. We might say, in structuralist terms, that BERT’s probabilities are computed following paradigmatic (predicting a word over others) and syntagmatic (based on its context) axes, whose order the “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03740463.2010.482311">poetic function</a>” of language subverts. By aggregating word probabilities within a sentence, we could then see how “fresh” or unexpected its language is.</p><p>The intuition, therefore, is that BERT would be better at predicting boilerplate than original writing. To test this out, I figured I would try it on a corpus where clichés are definitely common: North Korean literature.</p>
<h4 id="perplexity">1. Language models, perplexity &amp; BERT</h4><p>The idea that a language model can be used to assert how “common” the style of sentence is not new. The most widely used metric used to evaluate language models,&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity#:~:text=of%20size%20N).-,Perplexity%20per%20word,over%20entire%20sentences%20or%20texts.">perplexity</a>, can be used to&nbsp; score how probable (i.e. how meaningful and grammatically well-formed) a sequence of words (i.e. a sentence) is. Perplexity scores are&nbsp;used in tasks such as automatic translation or speech recognition to rate which of different possible outputs are the most likely to be a well-formed, meaningful sentence in a particular target language. There are however a few differences between traditional language models and BERT.</p><p>Traditional language models are sequential, working from left to right. You can think of it as an auto-complete feature: with the knowledge of the first words of a sentence, what is the most probable word that will come next. <a href="https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2017/pdfs/0513.PDF">Some models</a> have attempted to bypass this left-to-right limitation by using a shallow form of bidirectionality and using both the left-to-right and right-to-left contexts. But the left-to-right context and right-to-left context nonetheless remain independent from one another.</p><p>This is in contrast with BERT’s bidirectionality in which each word depends on the all the other words in the sentence. This deep bi-directionality is a strong advantage, especially if we are interested in literature, since it is much closer to how a human reader would assert the unexpectedness of a single word within a sentence. But the fact that BERT differs from traditional language models (although it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-2304.pdf">is nonetheless a language model</a>) also means that the traditional way of computing perplexity via the chain rule does not work. But that does not mean that obtaining a similar metric is impossible.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00363.pdf">Wang et al. (2020)</a>&nbsp;simply take the geometric mean of the probability of each word in the sentence:</p><p><img src="https://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4250bdb139f82e4647b4f30a58e3d31a_l3.png" alt="\prod_{i=1}^{n}p(w_{i}|w_{1},...,w_{i-1},w_{i+1},...,w_{n}))^{-1/n}" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="21" width="311"></p><p>which can constitute a convenient heuristic for approximating perplexity. Building on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-2304.pdf">Wang &amp; Cho (2019)</a>‘s&nbsp;pseudo-loglikelihood scores, <a href="https://assets.amazon.science/cc/54/980cb7d74f93849b49b9d5c42466/masked-language-model-scoring.pdf">Salazar et al. (2020)</a>&nbsp;devise a pseudo-perplexity score for masked language models defined as:</p><p><img src="https://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f8a2203d9d5f68a9beb20b6446c01d18_l3.png" alt="exp(\frac{-1}{n}\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}log(p(w_{i}|w_{1},...,w_{i-1},w_{i+1},...,w_{n}))))" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="22" width="388"></p><p>which we’ll use as our scoring metric.</p>
<h4 id="bert">2. Training a North Korean BERT</h4><p>Having a metric is nice, but it won’t be much use if we don’t have a model. Even though Korean was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09095">recently found to be on the upper half</a> of the NLP divide between low- and high-resource languages, that is really only true of South Korea. While North and South Korean language remain syntactically and lexically fairly similar, but cultural differences between the two means that language models trained on one are unlikely to perform well on the other (see <a href="https://digitalnk.com/blog/2017/12/23/north-and-south-korea-through-word-embeddings/">this previous post</a> for a quick overview of how embeddings trained in each of the languages can differ). And while there are a <a href="https://github.com/SKTBrain/KoBERT">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/snunlp/KR-BERT">BERT-based</a> <a href="https://twoblockai.com/2020/01/22/hanbert%EB%A5%BC-%EA%B3%B5%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/">models</a> trained on South Korean data. There are, less surprisingly, no models trained on North Korean data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_622"><a href="https://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-01-20_28_06-2004.09095.png"><img src="https://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-01-20_28_06-2004.09095.png" alt="" width="604" height="611"></a><figcaption>Map of NLP resources by languages in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09095.pdf">Joshi et al (2020)</a>. (South) Korean is in group 4, denoting languages with ” a large amount of unlabeled data, comparable to those possessed by the winners [group 5], and are only challenged by lesser amount of labeled data. With dedicated NLP communities conducting research on these languages, they have the potential to become winners and enjoy the fruits of ‘digital superiority’.”</figcaption></figure><p>Training BERT requires a significant amount of data.&nbsp; I do have quite a lot of good quality full-text North Korean data (mostly newspapers and literature), but even that only amounts to a 1.5Gb corpus of&nbsp;4.5 million sentences and 200 million tokens. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10053">Some</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03979">have</a> <a href="https://github.com/thirasan/bert-1">successfully</a> trained BERT from scratch with hardly more data, so the corpus might have been enough to do that. But since there were existing resources for the South Korean language and the two languages share a number of similarity, I figured I might be better off by simply grabbing one of the South Korean models and fine-tuning it on my North Korean corpus. I went with <a href="https://github.com/SKTBrain/KoBERT">KoBERT</a>, which is available as a huggingface model and would be easy to fine-tune.</p><p>This approach still presents a couple of challenges. There are significant spelling differences between North and South, so the vocabulary of the original model’s tokenizer won’t work well. This was compounded by a second problem, this time specific to the task at hand. I wanted to retain a high level of control over the tokens that would be masked in order to play around with the model and test masking different kinds of words. However, BERT tokenizers usually use <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/tokenizer_summary.html">Byte-Pair Encoding or Wordpiece</a>&nbsp;which breaks down tokens into smaller sub units. This is a powerful way to handle out-of-vocabulary tokens as well as prefixes and suffixes. However, that isn’t very helpful for us because instead of masking a single word, we would have to mask the word’s subunits and then find a way to meaningfully aggregate the probabilities of said subunits – a process which <a href="https://sjmielke.com/comparing-perplexities.htm">can be tricky</a>.</p><p>My solution is certainly not very subtle. I added a first layer of tokenization (by morpheme) then trained a new BERT Tokenizer on the tokenized corpus with a large vocabulary to be able to at least handle a good number of common words:</p>

                   ]  
)

tokenizer.save(".", "nkbert")
</pre><p>Then I simply added the vocabulary generated by the tokenizer to KoBERT’s tokenizer. One issue I encountered at this point was that adding any more than a few vocabulary words to an existing tokenizer’s vocabulary with huggingface’s tokenizers and the <code>add_token()</code> function will create a bottleneck that will make the finetuning process EXTREMELY slow. You will spend more time loading the tokenizer than actually fine-tuning the model. Fortunately a good soul had <a href="https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM/issues/157">ran into the issue</a> and solved it with the following workaround, which you can <a href="https://github.com/digitalprk/sih_notebooks/blob/master/run_language_modeling.py">easily incorporate</a> into huggingface’s sample training script:</p>
<pre title="">    from collections import OrderedDict
    from transformers import BertTokenizer, WordpieceTokenizer
    
    with open('nkbert-vocab.txt', 'r', encoding='utf8') as fp:
        vocab = …</pre></div></article></div>

<p>Ant Media’s WebRTC iOS SDK lets you build your own iOS application that can publish and play WebRTC broadcasts with just a few lines of code.<br>
In this doc, we’re going to cover the following topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the Sample WebRTC iOS app
<ul>
<li>Publish Stream from your iPhone</li>
<li>Play Stream on your iPhone</li>
<li>P2P Communication with your iPhone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Develop a WebRTC iOS app
<ul>
<li>How to Publish</li>
<li>How to Play</li>
<li>How to use DataChannel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run the Sample WebRTC iOS App</h2>
<ul>
<li> <h3>Download the WebRTC iOS SDK</h3> <p>WebRTC iOS SDK and WebRTC Android SDK’s are free to download. You can access them through<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://antmedia.io/free-webrtc-android-ios-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this link on antmedia.io</a>. If you’re an enterprise user, it will be also available for you to download in your subscription section in your “my account” page. Anyway, after you download the SDK, you can just unzip the file and open the project with Xcode.</p></li>
<li> <h3>Install Dependency</h3> <p>Open your terminal and go to the directory where the reference project resides and run<span>&nbsp;</span><code>pod install</code><span>&nbsp;</span>. If you are not familiar with pods, visit<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cocoapods.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cocoapods.org</a><span>&nbsp;</span>for documentation and installation.</p> <pre><code>cd /go/to/the/directory/where/you/unzip/the/SDK
pod install
</code></pre> <p>This install the Starscream packet for WebSocket connections.</p></li>
<li> <h3>Open and Run the Project in Xcode</h3> <p>Open the Xcode in your MacOS and Click the Open Another Project if you don’t see the Sample Project in your list.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/Xcode_open_another_project.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 1" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 1">Go to the directory where you download and unzip the iOS SDK. Open the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>AntMediaReferenceApplication.xcworkspace</code><span>&nbsp;</span>file</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/open_sample_project.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 2" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 2">After project is opened, connect your iPhone to your Mac and choose your iPhone in Xcode as shown below.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/choose_your_iphone_in_xcode.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 3" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 3">Click<span>&nbsp;</span><code>Run</code><span>&nbsp;</span>button on the top left of the Xcode. Then project is going to be built and deployed to your iPhone.</p> <p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/choose_your_iphone_in_xcode.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 3" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 3"></p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Publish Stream From Your iPhone</h2>
<p>Tap <code>Publish</code> button and then Tap <code>Set Server IP</code> under the connect button in your iPhone.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/tap_publish_button.png" width="240" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 5" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 5"></p>

<p>Write Your Ant Media Server’s full WebSocket URL and tap <code>Save</code> button. Its format is like this<br>
<code>ws://192.168.7.25:5080/WebRTCAppEE/websocket</code></p>
<p>If you install SSL to Ant Media Server, you can also use<br>
<code>wss://your_domain_address:5443/WebRTCAppEE/websocket</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/set_server_ip.png" width="240" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 6" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 6"></p>
<p>Set the stream id to anything else then ‘stream1’ and Tap ‘Connect’ button on the main screen. Then it will ask you to access the Camera and Mic. After you allow the Camera and Mic access, stream will be published on Ant Media Server.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/access_camera_ios.png" width="240" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 7" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 7"></p>
<p>Then it will start Publishing to your Ant Media Server. You can go to the web panel of Ant Media Server(http://server_ip:5080) and watch the stream there. You can also quickly play the stream via https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/player.html</p>
<h2>Play Stream On Your iPhone</h2>
<p>Playing stream on your iPhone is almost the same as Publishing. Before playing, make sure that there is a stream and it is being published to the server with same stream id in your textbox (You can quickly publish to the Ant Media Server via https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE). For our sample, stream id is still “stream1” in the image below. Then you just need to tap ‘Play’ button and tap ‘Connect’ button.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/tap_play_button.png" width="240" height="1334" alt="ant media WebRTC iOS SDK interface" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 8"><span></span></p>
<p>After tapping ‘Connect’ button, stream will start playing.</p>
<h2>P2P Communication With Your iPhone</h2>
<p>WebRTC iOS SDK also supports <a href="https://antmedia.io/how-to-create-webrtc-peer-to-peer-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P2P communication</a>. As you guess, just tap ‘P2P’ and then ‘Connect’ button.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/tap_p2p_button.png" width="240" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 8" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 9"></p>
<p>When there is another peer is connected to the same stream id via Android, iOS or Web, then P2P communication will be established and peers can talk to each other. You can quickly connect to the same stream id via https://your_domain:5443/WebRTCAppEE/peer.html</p>
<h2>Develop a WebRTC iOS app</h2>
<p>We highly recommend using the sample project to get started with your application. Nevertheless, it’s good to know the dependencies and how it works. Now we’re going to tell how to create a WebRTC iOS app from scratch by using WebRTC iOS SDK. Let’s get started.</p>
<h3>Create Xcode Project</h3>
<p>Open Xcode and Create a project. Choose <code>Single View App</code> from the templates.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/Xcode_new_project.png" width="480" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 9" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 10"></p>
<ul>Name your project as ‘WebRTCiOSApp’ below</ul>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/story_board_new_project.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 10" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 11"><span></span></p>
<p>Open your terminal and go to the directory where you create your project and make the pod installation. You can learn more about pods on <a href="https://cocoapods.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cocoapods.org</a></p>
<pre><code>cd /go/to/the/directory/where/you/create/the/project
pod init
</code></pre>
<p><code>Podfile</code> should be created after running<span>&nbsp;</span><code>pod init</code>. Open the<code>Podfile</code>, paste the following and save it.</p>
<pre><code>target 'WebRTCiOSApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for WebRTCiOSApp
 pod 'Starscream', '~&gt; 3.1.1'
end
</code></pre>
<p>Run the following command for pod installation</p>
<pre><code>pod install
</code></pre>
<p>Close the Xcode project and open the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>WebRTCiOSApp.xcworkspace</code><span>&nbsp;</span>in Xcode</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/open_workspace_xcode.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 11" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 12"><br>
Make the Project Target to iOS 10</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/ios_10.png" width="720" height="1928" alt="WebRTC iOS SDK" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 13"><br>
Disable bitcode</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/disable_bitcode.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 12" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 14"></p>
<p>Copy <code>WebRTC.framework</code> and <code>WebRTCiOSSDK.framework</code> folders to your projects directory.</p>
<p><code>WebRTC.Framework</code>: is directly available under<code>WebRTCiOSReferenceProject</code><br>
<code>WebRTCiOSSDK.Framework</code>: is the binary framework version of WebRTC iOS SDK. It’s created after running<span>&nbsp;</span><code>./export_fat_framework.sh</code> in <code>WebRTCiOSReferenceProject</code> directory. Then it will be ready under <code>Release-universal</code> directory. Alternatively, you can import source code of WebRTC iOS SDK to your project directly.</p>
<p>Embed <code>WebRTC.framework</code> and <code>WebRTCiOSSDK.framework</code> to your projects.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/click_add_items_to_embed.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 13" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 15"></p>
<p>Choose ‘Add Others’ in the coming windows at the bottom left and select <code>Add Files</code>. Then add <code>WebRTC.framework</code> and <code>WebRTCiOSSDK.framework</code>. After it’s done, it should be shown like below.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/frameworks_added.png" width="720" alt="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 14" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 16"></p>
<p>Try to build and run the app. If you get some errors like some methods are only available in some iOS versions. Use<span>&nbsp;</span><code>@available</code><span>&nbsp;</span>annotation. You can get more info about this<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fluffy.es/allow-app-created-in-xcode-11-to-run-on-ios-12-and-lower/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on this post</a></p>
<h2>How to Publish</h2>
<p>Create a UIView and add a Button to your StoryBoard. This is just simple iOS App development, we don’t give details here. You can get lots of tutorials about that on the Internet.<br>
Add Mic and Camera Usage Descriptions</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/images/camera_mic_usage.png" width="720" height="1928" alt="how to use WebRTC iOS SDK" title="Easy-to-use WebRTC iOS SDK Lets You Build WebRTC iOS App with 4 Lines of Code 17"></p>
<p>It’s now time to write some code. Initialize <code>webRTCClient</code> in <code>ViewController</code></p>
<div> <pre><span>let</span> webRTCClient<span>:</span> AntMediaClient <span>=</span> AntMediaClient.<span>init</span>()</pre></div><p>Add the following codes to <code>viewDidLoad()</code> method.</p>
<div> <pre> webRTCClient.<span>delegate</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span>
 webRTCClient.<span>setOptions</span>(<span>url</span>: <span><span>"</span>ws://ovh36.antmedia.io:5080/WebRTCAppEE/websocket<span>"</span></span>, <span>streamId</span>: <span><span>"</span>stream123<span>"</span></span>, <span>token</span>: <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span>, <span>mode</span>: .<span>publish</span>, <span>enableDataChannel</span>: <span>false</span>)
 webRTCClient.<span>setLocalView</span>(<span>container</span>: videoView, <span>mode</span>: .<span>scaleAspectFit</span>)
 webRTCClient.<span>start</span>()</pre></div><p>Implement the delegate in your <code>ViewController</code>. Xcode helps you for implementation.<br>
ViewController should look like below. After you run the Application, it will start publishing with streamId: ‘stream123’ to your server.</p>
<div> <pre><span>class</span> <span>ViewController</span>: <span>UIViewController </span>{

  <span>@IBOutlet</span> <span>var</span> videoView<span>:</span> UIView<span>!</span>

  <span>let</span> webRTCClient<span>:</span> AntMediaClient <span>=</span> AntMediaClient.<span>init</span>()

  <span>override</span> <span>func</span> <span>viewDidLoad</span>() {
    <span>super</span>.<span>viewDidLoad</span>()
    
    webRTCClient.<span>delegate</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span>
    <span>//Don't forget to write your server url.</span>
<span></span>    webRTCClient.<span>setOptions</span>(<span>url</span>: <span><span>"</span>ws://your_server_url:5080/WebRTCAppEE/websocket<span>"</span></span>, <span>streamId</span>: <span><span>"</span>stream123<span>"</span></span>, <span>token</span>: <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span>, <span>mode</span>: .<span>publish</span>, <span>enableDataChannel</span>: <span>false</span>)
    webRTCClient.<span>setLocalView</span>(<span>container</span>: videoView, <span>mode</span>: .<span>scaleAspectFit</span>)
    webRTCClient.<span>start</span>()
  }

}</pre></div><h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Playing a Stream is simpler than Publishing. We just need to change some codes in<span>&nbsp;</span><code>viewDidLoad()</code>. As a result, following code snippets just plays the stream on your server with streamId: ‘stream123’. Make sure that, before you try to play, you need to publish a stream to your server with having stream id ‘stream123’</p>
<div> <pre>  <span>class</span> <span>ViewController</span>: <span>UIViewController </span>{
   
    <span>@IBOutlet</span> <span>var</span> videoView<span>:</span> UIView<span>!</span>
   
    <span>let</span> webRTCClient<span>:</span> AntMediaClient <span>=</span> AntMediaClient.<span>init</span>()
   
    <span>override</span> <span>func</span> <span>viewDidLoad</span>() {
       <span>super</span>.<span>viewDidLoad</span>()
       
      
       webRTCClient.<span>delegate</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span>
        <span>//Don't forget to write your server url.</span>
<span></span>       webRTCClient.<span>setOptions</span>(<span>url</span>: <span><span>"</span>ws://your_server_url:5080/WebRTCAppEE/websocket<span>"</span></span>, <span>streamId</span>: <span><span>"</span>stream123<span>"</span></span>, <span>token</span>: <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span>, <span>mode</span>: .<span>play</span>, <span>enableDataChannel</span>: <span>false</span>)
       webRTCClient.<span>setRemoteView</span>(<span>remoteContainer</span>: videoView, <span>mode</span>: .<span>scaleAspectFit</span>)
       webRTCClient.<span>start</span>()
   }
 }</pre></div><h2>How to use Data Channel</h2>
<p>Ant Media Server and WebRTC iOS SDK can use data channels in WebRTC. In order to use <a href="https://antmedia.io/exchange-data-easily-using-webrtc-data-channels/">Data Channel</a>, make sure that it’s enabled both<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Data-Channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">server side</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and mobile. In order to enable it for server-side, you can just set the<span>&nbsp;</span><code>enableDataChannel</code><span>&nbsp;</span>parameter to true in<span>&nbsp;</span><code>setOptions</code><span>&nbsp;</span>method.</p>
<div> <pre>webRTCClient.<span>setOptions</span>(<span>url</span>: <span><span>"</span>ws://your_server_url:5080/WebRTCAppEE/websocket<span>"</span></span>, <span>streamId</span>: <span><span>"</span>stream123<span>"</span></span>, 
    <span>token</span>: <span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span>, <span>mode</span>: .<span>play</span>, <span>enableDataChannel</span>: <span>true</span>)</pre></div><p>After that, you can send data with the following method of<span>&nbsp;</span><code>AntMediaClient</code></p>
<div> <pre><span>func</span> <span>sendData</span>(<span><span>data</span></span>: Data, <span><span>binary</span></span>: <span>Bool</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>)</pre></div><p>When a new message is received, the delegate’s following method is called.</p>
<div> <pre><span>func</span> <span>dataReceivedFromDataChannel</span>(<span><span>streamId</span></span>: <span>String</span>, <span><span>data</span></span>: Data, <span><span>binary</span></span>: <span>Bool</span>)</pre></div><p>There is also data channel usage example exist in the Sample project.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you need to know more about all methods and delegates in WebRTC iOS SDK, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-iOS-SDK-Reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebRTC iOS SDK Reference</a></p>

    <article>

        

        <section>

            <p>If you missed my <a href="https://www.adamconrad.dev/blog/why-hiring-is-broken-and-how-im-dealing-with-it">previous article</a>, I’m going to spend a series of articles providing notes as I audit <a href="http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/">Steven Skiena’s CSE 373 Analysis of Algorithms class</a>.</p>

<p>In the first lecture, Skiena mentions you should take a data structures course and a linear algebra course before studying this material.</p>

<p>For professional (read: practical) purposes, we’re obviously not starting from scratch, but peaking at the syllabus I do believe we can incorporate data structures by implementing them in JavaScript (this is, after all, a front-end blog) along the way.</p>

<p>And as much as foundational linear algebra will help, there simply won’t be anything in a technical interview that would warrant deep study anyway, so we can safely skip this prerequisite.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-algorithm">What is an algorithm?</h2>

<p>An algorithm is <strong>an instruction set.</strong> Kind of like a recipe for a food dish. And just like that recipe for cauliflower rice you found on some random blog, you can translate that recipe into any language you want.</p>

<p>Algorithms are the same way: they are language-agnostic and can be expressed in a human-readable form or machine-readable. The simpler the idea, the easier it’s going to be to express in English. The more complex or nuanced the algorithm is, the more likely you’ll want to lean on a machine language like Python or JavaScript.</p>

<p>For practical purposes, think of the high-level overview of your algorithm as something you’ll explain to an interviewer in English before you dive into the code, but understand that in order to prove your chops as a programmer the code will have to be the primary source for explaining and validating the algorithms you design.</p>

<p>The two defining characteristics of an algorithm that separate an algorithm from other instructions are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>It’s correct.</strong> Has anyone ever received credit for implementing an algorithm in a tech interview that didn’t produce the correct result every single time?</li>
  <li><strong>It’s efficient.</strong> We’d like our algorithms to run sometime before we get old.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, <em>technically</em>, programs don’t have to run correctly to be acceptable. Programs that run instructions that are <em>mostly</em> correct are known as <em>heuristics</em>. These will become important when studying approximation algorithms later, but for now, assume that correctness is a requirement.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-prove-an-algorithm-is-correct">How do you prove an algorithm is correct?</h3>

<p>Proofs were not my strong suit in high school or college. For some reason, it never really clicked for me because the steps in a proof never seemed to line up with the logic my brain used to jump from one step to the next.</p>

<p>Luckily, the easiest way to prove correctness is to prove something <strong>isn’t correct.</strong></p>

<p>Wait, what? How does proving the opposite help us here?</p>

<p>Well, when we’re trying to figure out a correct and efficient algorithm to solve a problem, we can narrow the scope of possible choices by eliminating the ones that are demonstratively incorrect. Proving by counterexample can be far easier than other methods.</p>

<p>As a trivial example, suppose we have a total <em>T = 6</em> we want to strive for by adding up numbers in a valid set like <em>S = [1,2,3]</em>. It might seem like a very simple algorithm that will solve this problem is to pick numbers from left to right until we reach the total <em>T</em>. Even if you add in a big number at the beginning like <em>S = [5,1,2,3]</em> this works since we can just scrap the last two numbers.</p>

<p>What’s a counterexample that wouldn’t work?</p>

<p>How about <em>S = [5,2,4]</em>.</p>

<p>First, we pick 5, which is less than 6. There are no other numbers in our set that could add up to equal 6 after already picking 5, but there <em>is</em> a valid configuration that would still satisfy <em>T</em> (2 and 4). That’s proof by counterexample that our algorithm was not correct. It’s also a pretty simple counterexample. <strong>Counter-examples can be useful in the real-world to quickly help you assess if the path you’re going down is a good one or not.</strong></p>

<p>If you can come up with a relatively simple counterexample (simple meaning it should only require a handful of variables or items) you know that your algorithm is dead on arrival and you’ll need to try something else. If you can’t, you’re probably on the right track, but that doesn’t mean your algorithm is definitively correct.</p>

<h3 id="what-techniques-are-used-to-prove-correctness">What techniques are used to prove correctness?</h3>

<p>One way to prove correctness is induction. <strong>Proof by induction indicates that if we can solve for a base case <em>and</em> the general case for <code>n+1</code>, we know we’ve provided a correct answer for all possible inputs.</strong></p>

<p>There are two important connections to make here about induction which are useful in a professional setting:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Proof by induction is a mathematical form of recursion.</strong> Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming which allows a function to call itself. It allows us to split up large problems into smaller ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>The classic example here is the Fibonacci sequence (a sequence of integers where the current number is the sum of the previous two numbers). To calculate Fibonacci for a value <em>n</em> in the sequence, you <em>could</em> count up all of the previous numbers manually for each input of <em>n</em>, but that would not only be slow and laborious, it would also be difficult to express as a program.</p>

<p>Another way would be to count a few base cases (n = 0 and n = 1) to get the counting started, and then continuously call a <code>Fibonacci</code> function with the summed values from the previous step. Recursion is what allows us to accomplish this in code. It is the programming strategy for tackling induction, which is the mathematical strategy for proving statements for algorithms which operate on our sets of data.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Proof by induction is useful for summation.</strong> If you’re adding up a lot of inputs together, and you need to prove it will work for all cases, even ones larger than the set you have defined, it can be proven with induction.</li>
</ol>

<p>But are you ever going to need to formally prove something at work or in an interview? Absolutely not. <strong>But you will need to test your code, and tests are a form of proof.</strong></p>

<p>So while a formal mathematical proof of induction is likely way more rigorous than you will ever need to showcase in a professional setting, it does set the tone that you can’t simply write code and have people assume what you wrote is correct. It needs to be tested somehow, so if you have the mindset that your algorithm needs to be proven correct in some form, you’re on the right track to writing quality code.</p>

<h3 id="and-how-do-you-prove-something-is-efficient">And how do you prove something is efficient?</h3>

<p>If we’ll primarily be using code to express our algorithms, and tests to prove their correctness, Big O notation will be used to prove our algorithms are efficient.</p>

<p>We’ll cover Big O in a later post in this series, but the important thing to remember now is that in general, you’re going to want to strive for things that take a reasonable amount of time on large data.</p>

<p>For example, if something you design takes an <code>n!</code> factorial amount of time, anything over a measly 30 items and you’re dealing with numbers larger than the number of stars in the known universe. You <em>probably</em> want something that runs a bit faster than that.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture-on-the-properties-of-algorithms">The big picture on the properties of algorithms</h3>

<p>Most CS courses (and most schools) only ever care about these two things. If your teachers and TAs can successfully run your program within a reasonable amount of time, you get an A. Real life doesn’t give you an A for these two things because <em>you don’t work in a vacuum</em> as you do on a problem set or exam. So what things are missing from the real world picture?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Orthogonality:</strong> Is your code dependent on other stuff? Are you writing stateful or functional code? Since most coding whiteboard problems are isolated and self-contained, you usually can’t test for this, so make sure you present a portfolio of real-world projects and open source code to demonstrate this</li>
  <li><strong>Readability:</strong> You can write the hackiest crap to get an algorithm to work, but in the real world other people can’t read or use that code, and that’s a fail. Make sure if you have time and your code is correct and efficient, to <em>refactor</em> to demonstrate you can write readable, reusable code that is DRY (don’t repeat yourself) and orthogonal (or at least that it can be written as part of an orthogonal system)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-first-step-in-designing-an-algorithm">The first step in designing an algorithm</h3>

<p>So now that we know what defines an algorithm and what is required to prove it’s worth using to solve our problems, the next step is to decide how we will design our algorithms. Modeling a problem means knowing the objects you’re dealing with, and there are two classes of objects we will cover:</p>

<h4 id="combinatorial-objects">Combinatorial objects</h4>

<p>A <em>combinatorial object</em> is just a fancy way of saying “what kinds of things can I use to count with?” Since machines are just big 0 and 1 factories, combinatorial objects are the way for us to collect and organize all of the 0 and 1 math our machines are performing thousands upon millions of instructions per second. What kinds of things are we talking about?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Permutations:</strong> reorderings of a set. Colloquial terms for this include words like <em>arrangement</em>, <em>tour</em>, <em>ordering</em>, and/or <em>sequence</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>String:</strong> sequence of characters or patterns. Think of strings like permutations but with letters instead of numbers. Words like <em>text</em>, <em>character</em>, <em>pattern</em>, <em>label</em>, <em>sentence</em> are key insights that you’re dealing with string data.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsets:</strong> portions of a set. If you see words like <em>cluster</em>, <em>collection</em>, <em>committee</em>, <em>group</em>, <em>packaging</em>, or <em>selection</em>, you’ve probably got a subset.</li>
  <li><strong>Points:</strong> locations in space. Words like <em>node</em>, <em>site</em>, <em>position</em>, <em>record</em>, or <em>location</em> are all references to <em>points</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> nodes with vertices to connect them and give them direction. We mentioned this much earlier in this article. Words like <em>network</em>, <em>circuit</em>, <em>web</em>, and <em>relationship</em> all describe graphs.</li>
  <li><strong>Trees:</strong> graphs that flow in one direction and don’t end up where they started (acyclic). When they’re perfectly balanced, they literally look like a Christmas tree. Words like <em>hierarchy</em>, <em>dominance relationship</em>, <em>ancestor/descendent relationship</em>, <em>taxonomy</em> are all indicators you’re dealing with trees in your problem.</li>
  <li><strong>Polygon:</strong> …</li></ul></section></article></div></div>

    <p><strong>Part of a series:</strong> <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/tag/squeak-phone">#squeak-phone</a></p>

<hr>

<p>One <em>lovely</em> thing about working in Smalltalk is the effortlessness of
development.</p>

<p>I started off developing the code on my desktop machine, and
occasionally testing it on the phone itself. I just <code>rsync</code> the image
and changes files back and forth. This lets me pick up exactly where I
left off on the other device each time I move over.</p>

<p>However, <em>developing</em> on the phone was challenging because of the lack
of a keyboard (though I’ll post soon about an on-screen keyboard I’ve
written). So I installed RFB (from
<a href="http://source.squeak.org/ss/">here</a>) into my image on the desktop,
and tested it. Then I saved the image and <code>rsync</code>ed it to the phone as
usual, and presto, I can develop and test interactively on the phone
itself:</p>

<p><a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/bootstrapping-a-cellphone-20201007/vnc-to-phone.jpg"><img src="https://eighty-twenty.org/images/bootstrapping-a-cellphone-20201007/vnc-to-phone-640.jpg" alt="Using VNC to develop on the phone itself"></a>
Using VNC to develop on the phone itself</p>

<p>There were a couple of things I had to do to get this to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use this version of RFBServer: <a href="http://source.squeak.org/ss/">http://source.squeak.org/ss/</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change <code>AllowTcpForwarding no</code> to <code>yes</code> in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>
on the phone and then <code>service sshd restart</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <code>ssh -L 5900:localhost:5900 pm</code> to log into the phone (that’s
the green-screen transcript in the background in the picture above)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-75e492e5="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Engineer onboarding done right should get your new hires to solve issues and merge pull requests at a rapid pace. Team leads often miss the opportunity to pivot retention and witness their engineers fail to thrive while focusing on all the wrong things.</p>
<p>Onboarding, a predictor variable if you will, of an employee’s success and time-to-value for the company poses its own unique set of challenges with software engineers. When done remotely, onboarding can take the challenge to an entirely new level.</p>
<p><strong>In the past few weeks we made substantial additions to our engineering team, and here are some of our pivotal takeaways from the [remote] process.</strong></p>
<p><em>Recap</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>How to set up for success giving your codebase the right context</em></li>
<li><em>Learning by doing: a laser-focused streamlined set of coding tasks (explained in detail below)</em></li>
<li><em>Collecting feedback, applying and optimising</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Basics: Installations for Success</h2>
<p>The technical secret sauce to engineer onboarding is described in the next section, but to set things up for success, we need to get the basics right (we’re not talking about fancy desk arrangements and busy mentors). Companies with outstanding onboarding programs, make sure that new hires can address their new role with confidence from the get-go. For many engineers, setting up their development environment is the key to getting started, as well as getting product and business context.</p>
<p>What we did:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro’s and Installations</strong>. We created a list of installations and shared it with our new hires in advance, followed by a designated session with an experienced team member that made sure their dev environment was up and running on their first day. Note, independent installations can help new hires better understand their dev environment, also pushing us to strive for an elegant system that is quick and simple to set up.</li>
<li><strong>Code in Context</strong>. We made sure the first day included an introductory session with the entire team and provided an overview of the company and business. To give our codebase and development processes context, we provided an overview of our product evolution over Zoom and recorded the session for future onboardees, discussing various iterations and hypotheses already tested and the product at present.</li>
<li><strong>User-oriented</strong>. Early in the process, we made sure our new hires are users of our product, so they could understand the user experience first hand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize the time your senior team members spend onboarding new hires. Aim to onboard a few engineers on the same day and hold joint sessions. One of our hires also mentioned that</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“it felt great to be able to do most of the training independently without having to ask questions about trivial parts in the code.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Describe how their first day is going</strong> to look like and share a list of installations, with a document describing known issues and common pitfalls with setting up the environment. List the mentors, time frames, people to meet, and documents to read. Your first day should include: intro session with the entire team and provide an overview of the company, and the product (context).</li>
<li><strong>Ask the new engineers to take notes</strong> while installing their environment, and consequently update the installation guide for future engineers. This gives the new engineers an opportunity to contribute from the get-go.</li>
<li><strong>Record your onboarding sessions</strong> for future remote onboardees. Make sure you have a knowledge center to keep these on file, and your documentation set up and easily accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/beta-launched-devs.jpg" alt="swimm developers working on backend" title="Learning by doing. Swimm in practice. "></p>
<h2>Method: Learning by Doing [Done Right]</h2>
<p>The next challenge was learning by doing, and successfully getting our engineers oriented with the team’s codebase.</p>
<p>Our hands-on code exploration methodology is simple. We generate from our codebase, tasks that highlight the most relevant parts of the code while providing automated hints and tips. We focused our learning process on one element at a time. For example, we generated a bug in our codebase and then the onboardee’s task was to fix that bug. Examples from our codebase below highlight the CLI (which is just one element of our product). After solving these tasks, we provided our hires with tasks that rely on CLI-specific knowledge, and their code was then pushed to production.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Small</strong>. To familiarize themselves with our codebase our engineers were assigned laser-focused learning tasks starting simply with how to pass parameters to an existing command. In the first task, we focused on a command called <code>swimm reset</code> (that resets the internal program’s state). When the users run this command, they are prompted: “Are you sure?”, and only upon answering “Yes”, the reset takes place. The first task was to add the option <code>—- quiet</code>, which results in performing the reset without prompting the user for confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Guided Success</strong>. The second task asked the engineer to add a new command to the CLI. The third task was more complicated and involved understanding the entire flow of our CLI well. In order to solve it, the engineer had to understand a few different commands and how they integrate. Within these independent exercises, our new hires got a lot of automated guidance and hints if they were stuck, and got to compare their solution with the one originally implemented in the codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Touch Base</strong>. We made sure to have a daily session with the team and allow the new hires to ask questions. This doesn’t mean they couldn’t ask questions during the day, but it assured us that at least once a day we touch base. After a few days, we asked our new engineers what they felt was missing in their initial process.</li>
</ol>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a streamlined set of tasks that covers all important aspects of the codebase.</li>
<li>Share knowledge across team members by providing focused hands-on tasks.</li>
<li>Optimize your set of tasks over time, and ask your new onboardees to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Code Review: Lessons Learned</strong></h2>
<p>To sum-up, after only a few hours, our new engineers managed to implement a CLI command from scratch and tackled their first issues with confidence and a clear understanding of the main parts of the codebase. Within a few days, they felt confident in the parts of the code their onboarding plan covered and were able to tackle tasks with ease and contribute to each other’s onboarding plans.</p>
<p><strong>Main Takeaways</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with feedback</strong>. After just one day, we asked the onboardees to provide some feedback and we improved the process consequently. Specifically, we let them update the instructions for setting up the dev environment following their experience.</li>
<li><strong>Plan Meticulously</strong>. Onboarding remotely means having clear agendas planned in advance, holding a very organized first day with a list of important sessions. For us, it was critical to create a <strong>streamlined set of tasks</strong>, one that evolves over time and is always relevant and updated for a new engineer. We also found out that onboarding processes have a tendency to spark new conversations and ideas and used the momentum for knowledge sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Apart but together in the process</strong>. Although onboarding remotely, it’s important to engage new hires and make them feel part of the team. Finally, ask your new engineers what they feel was missing in their onboarding process. We found that even creating a single task that covers one complex issue, can save valuable time and confusion from future engineers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*Disclosure</strong>: We recently hired new engineers to Swimm, and invited them to use the Swimm app to orient themselves with the new code. Since Swimm is a tool helping engineers contribute to any codebase faster and better with automatically generated hints and codebase insight, we were putting our own work to the test. It was a unique introspective process. We are happy to share our learnings.*</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular frameworks for delivering machine learning projects.&nbsp; Both are great and versatile tools, yet there are several important differences between them, making them better suited for particular projects. So, what are the differences?&nbsp;</p><p>This text covers:</p><p>Also, there are multiple other frameworks to work with big data and machine learning. Is it fair to omit them in the comparison?&nbsp;</p><h3 id="landscape">Machine learning frameworks landscape</h3><p>Currently, there are at least 6 frameworks:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Scikit-Learn</li><li>TensorFlow</li><li>PyTorch</li><li>CAFFE</li><li>Microsoft Cognitive toolkit</li><li>Firebase</li></ol><p>There is no direct way to compare them apart from their popularity in Google Search. Considering that:&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.tooploox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-10-2-o-14.34.59.png" alt=""></p><p>The duopoly of Tensorflow and PyTorch is undoubtable – only these two make numbers big enough to be noticed by the search engine. You can see the Caffe and Microsoft Cognitive toolkits included in the graph, but the rest are not included due to the fact that the low number of searches monthly makes the comparison impossible.</p><p>So, there is PyTorch, there is TensorFlow and there is a big empty nothingness.&nbsp;</p><h2>Keras vs PyTorch?</h2><p>Until recently it was common to compare Keras and Pytorch while omitting the TensorFlow in the majority of articles and guides around the web. The reason behind that was simple – Keras is a high-level API that can be used “above TensorFlow” to access the functionality it provides without the need to chew into the more complicated aspects of the code.</p><p>Keras appeared to be so good that it was incorporated into the TensorFlow project and is currently an inherent part of it. Thus, now it is only about PyTorch vs TensorFlow comparison.</p><h3 id="what-is-tensorflow">What is TensorFlow at a glance?</h3><p>TensorFlow was initially developed by the Google Brain team. It is an open-source library used for numerical computations and large scale machine learning. Thus, it is used in multiple heavy-duty appliances.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology enables the developer to deliver a graph. A graph can also be considered one instance from a series of processing nodes. The high-level working environment works in Python and Nodes or tensors in TensorFlow and Python objects. On the other hand, though, the computations are done as high-performance C++ binaries.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="what-is-pytorch">What is PyTorch at a glance?</h3><p>PyTorch is a Facebook-backed framework that is direct competition to TensorFlow, providing similar functionalities. The framework was developed by the Facebook AI Research Lab and is distributed on the BSD license as an open-source software.&nbsp;</p><p>The software is based on the Torch library that was initially developed using the Lua programming language. PyTorch leverages the popularity and flexibility of Python while keeping the convenience and functionality of the original Torch library.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pytorch vs Tensorflow – a detailed comparison</h3><p><img src="https://www.tooploox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Keras-vs.-Pytorch_inside-txt_graph-1024x206.jpg" alt=""></p><p>From the non-specialist point of view, the only significant difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow is the company that supports its development. It is worth noting that the differences between the frameworks that were once very significant are now, in 2020, less and less pronounced, with both of them striving to keep up with the competition. Nonetheless, they are still far from identical.</p><p>In fact, there are several important differences between these frameworks that the data scientists and project managers need to know about.</p><h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2><p>TensorFlow used to be a lower-lever deep learning framework that became more friendly by introducing the Keras high-level API. Things changed significantly with TensorFlow 2.0, where Keras got incorporated into the core project.</p><p>From then on, both frameworks became user friendly and relatively easy to apply in daily jobs.&nbsp;</p><h4>TensorFlow</h4><p>TensorFlow is now much more friendly and convenient than it used to be. The framework includes both high-level APIs and more sophisticated tools for building complicated projects. Since the incorporation of Keras into the project, multiple redundancies and inconsistencies have been trimmed and the framework provides a stable and clean working environment.</p><p>When it comes to TensorFlow in daily work, the framework delivers a more concise, simpler API. This makes the project less bloated and the code more elegant. Usually, it would be the same amount of code. However, we can find some examples when TF is more precise.</p><h4>PyTorch</h4><p>PyTorch delivers a more flexible environment with the price of slightly reduced automation. In fact, the environment is a better pick for a team that has a deeper understanding of deep learning concepts and ideas behind commonly used algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>The framework is more “Pythonic” in construction, so in fact, a data scientist who has greater skill in Python programming can leverage this skill to gain much more from the framework and use it in a more natural way.</p><p>But this flexibility comes with a price – this popular deep learning framework requires more lines of code to deliver a project. The differences can be significant – a simple training loop requires five lines of code in PyTorch and only one in TensorFlow.</p><p><strong>Example:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Defining a training loop is an example of a use case where writing the code in PyTorch requires more lines of code. A typical example would be something like this:</p><p>Tensorflow with Keras:</p><p>PyTorch:</p><h2 id="graph-definition">Graph definition</h2><div><p>Graphs are essential when it comes to <a href="https://www.tooploox.com/data-science">data science</a> in the way roads are essential for traffic and transportation. Until recently, the approach toward graphs was the key and the most significant difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch. Now, it is not a big difference, as TF introduced dynamic computational graphs in eager mode and PyTorch introduced a static computational graph. So you can have both in TF and PyTorch, depending on what you need.</p><p>Yet the tradition stays strong and it is not easy to toss the legacy.&nbsp;</p></div><h4>TensorFlow</h4><p>The Classic TensorFlow graph was defined statically, so a data scientist (or any other user) got instant access to its outline before running the model. This allowed for a significant dose of control of the training process, the data flow, and the kind of data that got processed. Also, the graph in the TensorFlow could not be modified after compilation, so what came as an advantage in the design stage could be highly limiting later.</p><p>In Tensorflow 2.0, dynamic computational graphs were introduced in eager execution, which is available by default. The computational graph is built dynamically when variables are declared. It is run and provides output when the function is called.</p><h4>PyTorch</h4><p>PyTorch generates a dynamic graph on-the-go, delivering a Dynamic Computation Graph. So before the computations are running, there is no graph at all.&nbsp; You are also able to manipulate the graph on-the-go, which is very convenient for such deep learning architectures as recurrent neural networks, where you need variable-length inputs. It also makes the code quite easier to debug.</p><p>On the other hand, PyTorch now also allows for the building of a static computational graph, so you have both possibilities in the two frameworks.</p><p>Here is an example of a simple addition operation running in the graph (not much difference):</p><p>Tensorflow 2.0:</p><p>Pytorch:</p><h2 id="visualization">Visualization</h2><p>While programming is still about delivering the code, machine learning can be seen as data-centered programming. Having a convenient tool to deliver some visualizations can be a game-changer that eases the work of a data scientist, especially during parameter tweaking and the time-consuming training process.</p><h4>TensorFlow</h4><p>TensorFlow comes with a convenient and flexible TensorBoard dashboard dedicated to delivering visualizations.

<h3 id="hand-written-binary-parsingunparsing-sucks">Hand-written binary parsing/unparsing sucks</h3>

<p>As I’ve been working on a <a href="https://eighty-twenty.org/tag/squeak-phone/">mobile Smalltalk system</a>, I’ve found myself needing to decode
and encode a number of complex telephony packet
formats<sup id="fnref:telephony-complex"><a href="#fn:telephony-complex">1</a></sup> such as the following, an incoming SMS
delivery message containing an SMS-DELIVER TPDU in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.40">GSM 03.40</a> format,
containing seven-bit (!)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38">GSM 03.38</a>-encoded text:</p>

<pre><code>02 01 ffff
01 28 07911356131313f3
04 0b911316325476f8 000002909021044480 0ec67219644e83cc6f90b9de0e01
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out there are a <em>plethora</em> of such binary formats needed to
get a working cellphone.</p>

<p>I started off hand-rolling them, but it quickly became too much, so
I <s>borrowed liberally</s> <strong>stole</strong> from Erlang, and implemented
<a href="https://squeaksource.com/BitSyntax.html">BitSyntax for Smalltalk</a>. (After all, I am
already using
<a href="https://tonyg.github.io/squeak-actors/">Erlang-influenced actors</a> for
the Smalltalk system daemons!)</p>

<p>I’ve
<a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/bitsyntax/">done this before, for Racket</a>,
and there are plenty of other similar projects for e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/squaremo/bitsyntax-js#readme">JavaScript</a> and
<a href="https://bitstring.software/documentation/">OCaml</a>.</p>

<p>Every language needs a BitSyntax, it seems!</p>

<h3 id="what-does-bitsyntax-do">What does BitSyntax do?</h3>

<p>The BitSyntax package includes a <code>BitSyntaxCompiler</code> class which
interprets <code>BitSyntaxSpecification</code> objects, producing reasonably
efficient Smalltalk for decoding and encoding binary structures,
mapping from bytes to instance variables and back again.</p>

<p>The interface to the compiled code is simple. After compiling a
<code>BitSyntaxSpecification</code> for the data format above, we can analyze the
example message straightforwardly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="smalltalk"><span></span><span>parsedMessage</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SmsIncoming</span> <span>loadFrom:</span> (<span>ByteArray</span> <span>fromHex:</span>
    <span>'02 01 ffff</span>
<span>     01 28 07911356131313f3</span>
<span>     04 0b911316325476f8 000002909021044480 0ec67219644e83cc6f90b9de0e01'</span>)</code></pre></figure>

<p>and, if we wish, serialize it again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="smalltalk"><span></span><span>serializedBytes</span> <span>:=</span> <span>ByteArray</span> <span>streamContents:</span> [<span>:</span><span>w</span> <span>|</span> <span>parsedMessage</span> <span>saveTo:</span> <span>w</span>]</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>

<p>Syntax specifications are built using an embedded domain-specific
language (EDSL).</p>

<p>For example, for the above data format, we would supply the following
spec for class <code>SmsIncoming</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="smalltalk"><span></span>        (<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#msgType</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#type</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>2</span> <span>bytesLE</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#simIndex</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#id</span>)<span>,</span>
        ((<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>storeTemp:</span> <span>#payloadLength</span> <span>expr:</span> <span>'payload size'</span>)<span>,</span> <span>'payloadLength'</span> <span>bytes</span>)
            <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#payload</span> <span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span>
            (
                (<span>SmsAddress</span> <span>codecCountingOctets</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#smscAddress</span>)<span>,</span>
                (<span>SmsPdu</span> <span>codecIncoming</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#tpdu</span>))</code></pre></figure>

<p>along with appropriate specs for <code>SmsAddress</code> and <code>SmsPdu</code> (omitted
for space reasons here) and the following for the <code>SmsPdu</code> subclass
<code>SmsPduDeliver</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="smalltalk"><span></span>        (<span>1</span> <span>bit</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#replyPath</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>bit</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#userDataHeaderIndicator</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>bit</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#statusReportIndication</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>2</span> <span>bits</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>bit</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#moreMessagesToSend</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>2</span> <span>bits</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>)<span>,</span>

        (<span>SmsAddress</span> <span>codecCountingSemiOctets</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#originatingAddress</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#protocolIdentifier</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#dataCodingScheme</span>)<span>,</span>
        ((<span>7</span> <span>bytes</span>
                <span>transformLoad:</span> [<span>:</span><span>v</span> <span>|</span> <span>'self class decodeSmscTimestamp: '</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span>]
                <span>save:</span> [<span>:</span><span>v</span> <span>|</span> <span>'self class encodeSmscTimestamp: '</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span>])
            <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#serviceCentreTimeStamp</span>)<span>,</span>
        (((<span>1</span> <span>byte</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#itemCount</span>)
            <span>transformLoad:</span> [<span>:</span><span>v</span> <span>|</span> <span>'self userDataOctetsFor: '</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span>]
            <span>save:</span> [<span>:</span><span>v</span> <span>|</span> <span>'itemCount'</span>])
                <span>storeTemp:</span> <span>#userDataLength</span> <span>expr:</span> <span>'userData size'</span>)<span>,</span>
        (<span>#userDataLength</span> <span>bytes</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>#userData</span>)</code></pre></figure>

<p>These are non-trivial examples; the simple cases are simple, and the
complex cases are usually possible to express without having to write
code by hand. The EDSL is extensible, so more combinators and parser
types can be easily added as the need arises.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-get-it">How do I get it?</h3>

<p>Tracking down <em>all</em> the associations that need to be eager loaded in order to prevent N+1 queries can be tedious. Your code has to be <em>instrumented properly</em> and most of the times you need to reason about every single query, <em>one by one</em>. On top of that, eager loading can be fussy: calling <code>where</code>, <code>order</code> or <code>limit</code> on your associations might invalidate your eager loading efforts in some <em>unexpected</em> ways.</p>

<p>This article will present an <a href="#automatic-eager-loading"><strong>automated way of dealing with N+1</strong></a> queries and it will explain <a href="#things-that-break-eager-loading-where-order-limit"><strong>how to go around some of the limitations of eager loading</strong></a> in ActiveRecord. Furthermore, it will show you <a href="#preventing-n1-regressions-with-tests"><strong>how to write tests</strong></a> to prevent those sneaky N+1 queries from coming back.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-eager-loading">Automatic eager loading</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/salsify/goldiloader">Goldiloader</a> is a gem that eager loads your associations <em>automatically</em> and <em>only when needed</em>.</p>

<p>Just add it in your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>



<p>…and watch as your associations are <em>magically</em> eager loaded:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how there was <strong>no need to explicitly call <code>includes(:posts)</code></strong> when querying users. Without Goldiloader, that second call would have triggered <em>five</em> queries instead of one. With Goldiloader, you basically don’t have to think about calling <code>includes</code> any more.</p>

<p><strong>Goldiloader pairs very nicely with GraphQL APIs</strong>. The moment your API allows for querying associations or associations of associations, you have a little <em>N+1 nightmare</em> on your hands. GraphQL APIs with various different clients are hard to optimize because they might be used in so many different ways. Integrating something like <a href="https://github.com/shopify/graphql-batch">graphql-batch</a> could address the problem, but you have to apply it to every individual case and it’s a more intrusive solution.</p>

<p>On top of that, if you’re working on a large code base or if you’re inexperienced about dealing with N+1 queries, Goldiloader might give you a nice performance boost at a low cost, albeit with some limitations which we will discuss in the next part.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-break-eager-loading-where-order-limit">Things that break eager loading: <code>where</code>, <code>order</code>, <code>limit</code></h2>

<p>Applying <code>where</code>, <code>order</code> or <code>limit</code> clauses on your ActiveRecord associations will break eager loading, whether you’re using Goldiloader or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to make the following examples more generic, I’ll be using <code>includes</code> calls instead of Goldiloader. If you’re using Goldiloader, simply remove them or consider them redundant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we try to <code>order</code> our posts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5)</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:created_at</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1 ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 2 ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 3 ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 4 ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 5 ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even though calling <code>includes(:posts)</code> produced an <code>IN</code> query which seems to cover all our posts, applying the <code>order</code> clause on our association ignored this and triggered a bunch of N+1 queries. In order for eager loading to work, <strong>the eager loaded query should match the query required to fetch your association</strong>.</p>

<p>One way to avoid this is by moving the <code>order</code> inside a <strong>default scope</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Post</span>
  <span>default_scope</span> <span>{</span> <span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:created_at</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5) ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># No queries here, they've been eager loaded already</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…another way is by moving the <code>order</code> inside the <strong>parent association</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:posts</span><span>,</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:created_at</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5) ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># No queries here, they've been eager loaded already</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…and yet another way is by moving the <code>order</code> inside a <strong>scoped parent association</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:ordered_posts</span><span>,</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>order</span><span>(</span><span>:created_at</span><span>)</span> <span>},</span> <span>class_name: </span><span>"Post"</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:ordered_posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5) ORDER BY "posts"."created_at" ASC</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>ordered_posts</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># No queries here, they've been eager loaded already</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply a <code>where</code> condition to our posts:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" LIMIT 5</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" IN (1,2,3,4,5)</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 1 AND (created_at &lt; '2020-09-25 08:55:05.919824')</span>

<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE "posts"."user_id" = 3 AND (created_at &lt; '2020-09-25 08:55:05.919824')</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, that didn’t work. But we can fix it exactly the same way.</p>

<p>You can move the <code>where</code> condition inside a <strong>default scope</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Post</span>
  <span>default_scope</span> <span>{</span> <span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> 
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…or inside the <strong>parent association</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:posts</span><span>,</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>…or inside a <strong>scoped parent association</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:posts_from_one_week_ago</span><span>,</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts_from_one_week_ago</span><span>).</span><span>limit</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mastering eager loading basically means <strong>relying more on default scopes</strong> and <strong>applying scopes inside your associations</strong> rather than using those scopes directly.</p>

<p>What about <code>limit</code> and <code>offset</code>? Depending on your use case, you could apply the same techniques. But there’s one big use case that just doesn’t fit here: <strong>pagination</strong>. How would you supply the page number? And while we’re at it, how would you deal with <code>where</code> conditions or <strong>scopes that contain a variable</strong>?</p>

<h2 id="turn-your-queries-around">Turn your queries around</h2>

<p>Unlike scopes, <strong>default scopes and scoped associations don’t take arguments</strong>. If we’d like to provide our associations with an outside parameter while avoiding N+1 queries, we’ll have to think of something else.</p>

<p>Consider the following code which produces N+1 queries:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># An outside parameter</span>
<span>time</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span>

<span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:posts</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span>users</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>user</span><span>|</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>time</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span> <span>}</span> <span># N+1!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In such cases, you can turn your queries around and <strong>let the association become the main subject of that query</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># An outside parameter</span>
<span>time</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>.</span><span>week</span><span>.</span><span>ago</span>

<span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>Post</span><span>.</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>:user</span><span>).</span><span>where</span><span>(</span><span>"created_at &lt; ?"</span><span>,</span> <span>time</span><span>).</span><span>to_a</span>
<span># SELECT "posts".* FROM "posts" WHERE (created_at &lt; '2020-09-27 10:03:23.478773')</span>
<span># SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IN (1,2,3,4,5)</span>

<span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>posts</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:user</span><span>)</span>
<span># No queries here, they've been eager loaded already</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="preventing-n1-regressions-with-tests">Preventing N+1 regressions with tests</h2>

<p>Given a large code base, introducing more N+1 queries is fairly easy – as easy as writing <code>user.posts</code> inside a loop, somewhere deep inside a template, without remembering to also eager load the association in the controller. But you can write tests to prevent that…</p>

<p>First, let’s settle on the behaviour we’d like to test: <strong>any request should trigger at most one SQL query per table</strong>. In order to track and count all these queries, we could use ActiveSupport instrumentation to hook up to the <code>sql.active_record</code> event, the same way ActiveRecord is <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6-0-stable/activerecord/test/cases/test_case.rb">tested</a>.</p>

<p>I already packaged this in a tiny gem called <a href="https://github.com/lipanski/sql-spy">sql_spy</a>.</p>

<p>Just add it to your <code>Gemfile</code>:</p>



<p>…and let’s write our first <strong>controller test</strong>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>"sql_spy"</span>

<span>class</span> <span>PostsControllerTest</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActionDispatch</span><span>::</span><span>IntegrationTest</span>
  <span>test</span> <span>"GET /posts should not trigger N+1 queries"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span># Add some realistic test data here</span>

    <span>queries</span> <span>=</span> <span>SqlSpy</span><span>.</span><span>track</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>get</span> <span>"/posts"</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>select_queries_by_model</span> <span>=</span> <span>queries</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:select?</span><span>).</span><span>group_by</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>:model_name</span><span>)</span>
    <span># We only want the SELECT queries and we'd like them grouped by model</span>

    <span>assert</span> <span>select_queries_by_model</span><span>.</span><span>all?</span> <span>{</span> <span>|</span><span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>queries</span><span>|</span> <span>queries</span><span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
    <span># Our tolerance rate is 1 query per table</span>
    <span># You can increase this value depending on your business logic</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some things are worth mentioning here. <strong>Your test is only as correct as the test data you provide it with</strong>. Ideally try to keep a realistic set of fixtures around (3-4 examples of each core model) or create a realistic environment before the test run.</p>

<p>Some requests might genuinely be triggering <strong>more than one query per table</strong>. For example, paginated …</p></section></div></div>

<p>This is the first entry in a (potentially infinite) series of dead end roads in the field of cryptanalysis.</p>



<p>Cryptography engineering is one of many specialties within the wider field of security engineering. Security engineering is a discipline that chiefly concerns itself with studying <em>how</em> systems fail in order to build better systems–ones that are resilient to malicious acts or even natural disasters. It sounds much <a href="https://dymaxion.org/essays/ngodevsecpart1.html">simpler than it is</a>.</p>



<p>If you want to develop and securely implement a cryptography feature in the application you’re developing, it isn’t enough to learn how to implement textbook descriptions of cryptography primitives during your C.S. undergrad studies (<a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/06/10/how-to-learn-cryptography-as-a-programmer/">or equivalent</a>). An active interest in studying how cryptosystems fail is the prerequisite for being a cryptography engineer.</p>



<p><strong>Thus, cryptography engineering and cryptanalysis research go hand-in-hand.</strong></p>

<p>If you are interested in exploring the field of cryptanalysis–be it to contribute on the attack side of cryptography or to learn better defense mechanisms–you will undoubtedly encounter roads that seem enticing and not well-tread, and it might not be immediately obvious <em>why</em> the road is a dead end. Furthermore, beyond a few comparison tables on Wikipedia or obscure Stack Exchange questions, the cryptology literature is often sparse on details about why these avenues lead nowhere.</p>



<p>So let’s explore where some of these dead-end roads lead, and why they stop where they do.</p>







<h2 id="length-extension-attacks">Length Extension Attacks</h2>



<p>It’s difficult to provide a better summary of length extension attacks than <a href="https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2012/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hash-length-extension-attacks">what Skull Security wrote in 2012</a>. However, that only addresses “What are they?”, “How do you use them?”, and “Which algorithms and constructions are vulnerable?”, but leaves out a more interesting question: “Why were they even possible to begin with?”</p>

(Art by <a href="https://twitter.com/SwizzlestixUK">Swizz</a>.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To really understand length extension attacks, you have to understand how cryptographic hash functions used to be designed. This might sound intimidating, but we don’t need to delve too deep into the internals.</p>



<p>A cryptographic hash function is a keyless pseudorandom transformation from a variable length input to a fixed-length output. Hash functions are typically used as building blocks for larger constructions (both reasonable ones like HMAC-SHA-256, and unreasonable ones like my <a href="https://github.com/soatok/hash-crypt">hash-crypt</a> project).</p>



<p>However, hash functions like SHA-256 are designed to operate on sequential blocks of input. This is because sometimes you need to stream data into a hash function rather than load it all into memory at once. (This is why you can sha256sum a file larger than your available RAM without crashing your computer or causing performance headaches.)</p>



<p>A streaming hash function API might look like this:</p>



<pre><code>class MyCoolHash(BaseHashClass):
    @staticmethod
    def init():
        """
        Initialize the hash state.
        """

    def update(data):
        """
        Update the hash state with additional data.
        """

    def digest():
        """
        Finalize the hash function.
        """

   def compress():
        """
        (Private method.)
        """ </code></pre>



<p>To use it, you’d call <code>hash = MyCoolHash.init()</code> and then chain together <code>hash.update()</code> calls with data as you load it from disk or the network, until you’ve run out of data. Then you’d call <code>digest()</code> and obtain the hash of the entire message.</p>



<p>There are two things to take away right now:</p>



<ol><li>You can call <code>update()</code> multiple times, and that’s valid.</li><li>Your data might not be an even multiple of the internal block size of the hash function. (More often than not, it won’t be!)</li></ol>



<p>So what happens when you call <code>digest()</code> and the amount of data you’ve passed to <code>update()</code> is not an even multiple of the hash size?</p>



<p>For most hash functions, the answer is simple: Append some ISO/IEC 7816-4 padding until you get a full block, run that through a final iteration of the internal compression function–the same one that gets called on <code>update()</code>–and then output the current internal state.</p>



<p>Let’s take a slightly deeper look at what a typical runtime would look like for the MyCoolHash class I sketched above:</p>



<ol><li><code>hash = MyCoolHash.init()</code><ul><li>Initialize some variables to some constants (initialization vectors).</li></ul></li><li><code>hash.update(blockOfData)</code><ul><li>Start with any buffered data (currently none), count up to 32 bytes. If you’ve reached this amount, invoke <code>compress()</code> on that data and clear the buffer. Otherwise, just append blockOfData to the currently buffered data.</li><li>For every 32 byte of data not yet touched by <code>compress()</code>, invoke <code>compress()</code> on this block (updating the internal state).</li><li>If you have any leftover bytes, append to the internal buffer for the next invocation to process.</li></ul></li><li><code>hash.update(moreData)</code><ul><li>Same as before, except there might be some buffered data from step 2.</li></ul></li><li><code>output = hash.digest()</code><ul><li>If you have any data left in the buffer, append a 0x80 byte followed by a bunch of 0x00 bytes of padding until you reach the block size. If you <em>don’t</em>, you have an entire block of padding (0x80 followed by 0x00s).</li></ul><ul><li>Call <code>compress()</code> one last time.</li><li>Serialize the internal hash state as a byte array or hexadecimal-encoded string (depending on usage). Return that to the caller.</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>This is fairly general description that will hold for most older hash functions. Some details might be slightly wrong (subtly different padding scheme, whether or not to include a block of empty padding on <code>digest()</code> invocations, etc.).</p>



<p>The details aren’t super important. Just the <em>rhythm</em> of the design.</p>



<ul><li><code>init()</code></li><li><code>update()</code><ul><li>load buffer, <code>compress()</code></li><li><code>compress()</code></li><li><code>compress()</code></li><li>…</li><li>buffer remainder</li></ul></li><li><code>update()</code><ul><li>load buffer, <code>compress()</code></li><li><code>compress()</code></li><li><code>compress()</code></li><li>…</li><li>buffer remainder</li></ul></li><li>…</li><li><code>digest()</code><ul><li>load buffer, pad, <code>compress()</code></li><li>serialize internal state</li><li>return</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>And thus, without having to know any of the details about what <code>compress()</code> even looks like, the reason why length extension attacks were ever possible should leap out at you!</p>







<p>If it doesn’t, look closely at the difference between <code>update()</code> and <code>digest()</code>.</p>



<p>There are only two differences:</p>



<ol><li><code>update()</code> doesn’t pad before calling <code>compress()</code></li><li><code>digest()</code> returns the internal state that <code>compress()</code> always mutates</li></ol>



<p>The reason length-extension attacks are possible is that, for some hash functions, the output of <code>digest()</code> is its full internal state.</p>



<p>This means that you can run take an existing hash function and <em>pretend it’s the internal state after an <code>update()</code> call instead of a <code>digest()</code> call</em> by appending the padding and then, after calling <code>compress()</code>, appending additional data of your choice.</p>



<h2 id="futility">The (F)Utility of Length Extension</h2>



<p>Length-Extension Attacks are mostly used for attacking naive message authentication systems where someone attempts to authenticate a message (M) with a secret key (k), but they construct it like so:</p>



<pre><code>auth_code = vulnerable_hash(k.append(M))</code></pre>



<p>If this sounds like a very narrow use-case, that’s because it is. However, <a href="http://netifera.com/research/flickr_api_signature_forgery.pdf">it still broke Flickr’s API once</a>, and it’s a popular challenge for CTF competitions around the world.</p>



<p>Consequently, length-extension attacks are sometimes thought to be vulnerabilities of the construction rather than a vulnerability of the hash function. For a Message Authentication Code construction, these are classified under <strong>canonicalization attacks</strong>.</p>



<p>After all, even though SHA-256 is vulnerable to length-extension, but you can’t actually exploit it unless someone is <em>using it</em> in a vulnerable fashion.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s often common to say that hash functions like SHA-256 and SHA-512 are <em>prone</em> to length-extension.</p>



<h3 id="avoid-length-extension-attacks">Ways to Avoid Length-Extension Attacks</h3>



<p><strong>Use HMAC.</strong> HMAC was designed to prevent these kinds of attacks.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you don’t have any cryptographic secrets, you can always do what bitcoin did: Hash your hash again.</p>



<pre><code>return sha256(sha256(message))</code></pre>



<p>Note: Don’t actually do that, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/382">it’s dangerous for other reasons</a>. You also don’t want to take this to an extreme. If you iterate your hash too many times, you’ll <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/05/putting-the-fun-in-hash-function/">reinvent PBKDF1 and its insecurity</a>. Two is plenty.</p>



<p>Or you can do something really trivial (which ultimately became another standard option in the SHA-2 family of hash functions):</p>



<p>Always start with a 512-bit hash and then <em>truncate your output </em>so the attacker never recovers the entire internal state of your hash in order to extend it.</p>



<p>That’s why you’ll sometimes see SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 in a list of recommendations. This isn’t saying “use one or the other”, that’s the (rather confusing) notation for a standardized SHA-512 truncation.</p>



<p>Note: This is actually what SHA-384 has done all along, and that’s one of the reasons why you see SHA-384 used more than SHA-512.</p>



<p>If you want to be extra fancy, you can also just use a different hash function that isn’t vulnerable to length extension, such as SHA-3 or BLAKE2.</p>



<h2 id="q-and-a">Questions and Answers</h2>







<h3 id="blake2">Why isn’t BLAKE2 vulnerable to length extension attacks?</h3>



<p>Quite simply: <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/ae4add868124a32d4e54da10f9cd99240aecc0aa/src/libsodium/crypto_generichash/blake2b/ref/blake2b-ref.c#L311">It sets a flag in the internal hash state</a> before compressing the final buffer.</p>



<p>If you try to deserialize this state then invoke <code>update()</code>, you’ll get a different result than BLAKE2’s <code>compress()</code> produced during <code>digest()</code>.</p>



<p>For a secure hash function, a single bit of difference in the internal state should result in a wildly different output. (This is called the avalanche effect.)</p>



<h3 id="sha3">Why isn’t SHA-3 vulnerable to length extension attacks?</h3>



<p>SHA-3 is a sponge construction whose internal state is much larger than the hash function output. This prevents an attacker from recovering the hash function’s internal state from a message digest (similar to the truncated hash function discussed above).</p>



<h3 id="signatures">Why don’t length-extension attacks break digital signature algorithms?</h3>



<p>Digital signature algorithms–such as RSASSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA–take a cryptographic hash of a message and then perform some asymmetric cryptographic …</p></div></div></div>

<span>Mon Oct 5, 2020</span></h4><hr><br></p><p><strong>Let’s talk about that thing nobody’s talking about.
Let’s talk about a vulnerability that’s exposing 2018-2020 Macs while most are declining to act nor report about the matter.
Oh, and did I mention it’s unpatchable?</strong></p><p><strong>Buckle up buckaroo, we’re in for a wild ride.</strong></p><p>Skip to <a href="#security-issues">#security-issues</a> for the technical mumbo-jumbo.</p><h2 id="preface">Preface</h2><h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3><p>The following post is an industry analysis of the code and research performed by <a href="https://twitter.com/axi0mx/">twitter.com/axi0mx</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/h0m3us3r/">twitter.com/h0m3us3r</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aunali1/">twitter.com/aunali1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mcmrarm/">twitter.com/mcmrarm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/su_rickmark/">twitter.com/su_rickmark</a> who poured endless hours of work into this, allowing companies and users to understand their risks concerning this issue.</p><h3 id="intel-vs-silicon">Intel vs Silicon</h3><p>This blog post only applies to macOS systems with an Intel processor and the embedded T2 security chip.
Apple silicon systems will run completely on a set of Apple-designed ARM processors and mighth have a different topology, e.g. based on the A12.
Since the A12 chip seems to have fixed this issue (to be confirmed), it’s highly likely the new Apple Silicon machines will not be vulnerable.
And while the new upcoming Intel Macs at the end of year will probably receive a new hardware revision of the T2 chip (e.g. based on the A12), we are still stuck with this vulnerability on Macs between 2018 and 2020.</p><h3 id="so-about-this-t2-thing">So about this T2 thing</h3><p>In case you are using a recent macOS device, you are probably using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862">the embedded T2 security chip</a> which runs <em>bridgeOS</em> and is actually based on watchOS. This is a custom ARM processor designed by Apple based on the A10 CPU found in the iPhone 7.
The T2 chip contains a <em>Secure Enclave Processor</em> (SEP), much like the A-series processor in your iPhone will contain a SEP.</p><p>While newer Macs and/or Apple Silicon (including the dev kit) will use a more recent A-series processor such as the one found in the recent iPhone (A12), current Macs still use the A10.</p><p>It performs a predefined set of tasks for macOS such as audio processing, handling I/O, functioning as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">Hardware Security Module</a> for e.g. Apple KeyChain or 2FA, hardware accelerating media playback, whitelisting kernel extensions, cryptographic operations and <strong>ensuring the operating system you are booting is not tampered with</strong>.
The T2 chip runs its own firmware called <em>bridgeOS</em>, which can be updated when you install a new macOS version. (ever notice the screen flickering? that’s the display driver being interrupted and possibly updated.)</p><p><em>Edit</em>: I first mentioned the iPad Pro to be impacted by the T2 vulnerability, but while it could suffer from the same vulnerability, it does not contain a T2 chip.</p><h3 id="the-macos-boot-sequence">The macOS boot sequence</h3><p>So let’s focus on the boot image verification on macOS. What exactly happens when you press that power button?
<a href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/bootprocess.png">There’s also a visual representation for any <em>conaisseurs</em></a>.
For the enthusiasts, I personally find <a href="https://michaellynn.github.io/2018/07/27/booting-secure/">Booting Secure by mikeymikey</a> a more in-depth description.</p><ol><li><p>The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.</p></li><li><p>The press of the power button or the opening of the lid triggers the System Management Controller (SMC) to boot.</p></li><li><p>The SMC performs a Power-On-Self-Test (POST) to detect any EFI or hardware issues such as bad RAM and possibly redirect to Recovery.</p></li><li><p>After those basic sanity checks, the T2 chip is triggered and I/O connectors are setup. (USB, NVMe, PCIe, …) It will use NVMe and PCIe to talk to NAND storage.</p></li><li><p>The applicable boot disk is selected and a disk encryption password is asked if enabled to mount <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System">APFS</a> volumes possibly via FileVault2 disk encryption.</p></li><li><p><code>/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi</code> is located on your System APFS volume and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208330">depending on your secure boot settings</a> is validated.</p></li><li><p><em>boot.efi</em> is ran which loads the Darwin kernel <em>(throwback to BSD)</em> (or Boot Camp if booting Microsoft Windows) &amp; IODevice drivers. If a kernel cache is found in <code>/System/Library/PrelinkedKernels/prelinkedkernel</code>, it will use that.</p></li><li><p>Any User Approved Kernel Extensions are initialized &amp; added to the kernel space -if- they are approved by the T2 chip.
<em>This will go away with System Extensions</em>.</p></li></ol><h3 id="macos-security-features">macOS security features</h3><p>So Apple has a couple of tricks up its sleeve to limit the attack surface of any potential security vulnerabilities. A small summary of related measures since macOS Big Sur on Intel processors:</p><ul><li><p><em>System Integrity Protection</em> (SIP): a read-only <code>/System</code> partition so the base install of macOS (including the kernel) cannot be tampered with.</p></li><li><p><em>System Extensions</em>: a move to away from Kernel Extensions, getting external code out of the Kernel framework-wise.</p></li><li><p><em>Secure Boot</em>: verifies the signature validity of the operating system on disk.</p></li><li><p><em>Filesystem seals</em>: every byte of data is compared to a hash in the filesystem metadata tree, recursively verifying integrity.</p></li></ul><h3 id="apple-marketing">Apple marketing</h3><p>As you probably all already know, Apple pushes forward privacy &amp; security as important weapons in todays world of technology.
They tout their devices as highly secure and vouch to handle your personal data using a privacy-centric approach.
While there have been mistakes made in the past (who can blame them?), Apple has been generally quick to fix any security issues that were disclosed to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201220">their responsible disclosure program</a> or in public.</p><h2 id="security-issues">Security issues</h2><h3 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h3><h3 id="the-core-problem">The core problem</h3><p>The mini operating system on the T2 (<em>SepOS</em>) suffers from a security vulnerable also found in the iPhone 7 since it contains a processor based on the iOS A10. Exploitation of this type of processor for the sake of installing homebrew software is very actively discussed in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak</a> subreddit.</p><p>So using the <a href="https://checkm8.info/">checkm8 exploit</a> originally made for iPhones, the checkra1n exploit was developed to build a semi-tethered exploit for the T2 security chip, exploiting a flaw. This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.</p><p>Normally the T2 chip will exit with a fatal error if it is in DFU mode and it detects a decryption call, but thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/windknown/presentations/blob/master/Attack_Secure_Boot_of_SEP.pdf">blackbird vulnerability</a> by team Pangu, we can completely circumvent that check in the SEP and do whatever we please.</p><p>Since sepOS/BootROM is <em>Read-Only Memory</em> for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.
This thankfully also means that this is not a persistent vulnerability, so it will require a hardware insert or other attached component such as a malicious USB-C cable.</p><h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3><p>Every Apple iDevice (which includes the T2 and the Watch, via a port under the band) ships with a firmware recovery USB interface called Device Firmware Update (DFU), which is triggered when the device is not be able to boot or by pressing a particular set of buttons when turned on. It is always available because it is code run from SecureROM. This is the mode in which checkm8 runs.</p><p>Apple also leaves the ability to access various debug functionality which is disabled on production devices unless a special boot payload is used which runs in DFU. Since Apple is the only one who can sign code for DFU, they can demote any device they like, including the most recent A14 processors.
But since the checkm8 vulnerability runs so early in the boot process, we too can demote the T2 into DFU mode.
Without checkm8, we would not be able to run unsigned code in DFU and thus not be able enable debug interfaces. Once the debug interface is enabled Apple uses specialized cables with simian names (see Chimp, Kanzi, Gorilla).</p><h3 id="impact">Impact</h3><p>Once you have access on the T2, you have full <code>root</code> access and kernel execution privileges since the kernel is rewritten before execution.
Good news is that if you are using FileVault2 as disk encryption, they do not have access to your data on disk <em>immediately</em>.
They can however inject a keylogger in the T2 firmware since it manages keyboard access, storing your password for retrieval or transmitting it in the case of a malicious hardware attachment.</p><p>The functionality of locking an Apple device remotely (e.g. via MDM or FindMy) can be bypassed (<em>Activation Lock</em>).</p><p>A firmware password does not mitigate this issue since it requires keyboard access, and thus needs the T2 chip to run first.</p><p>Any kernel extension could be whitelisted since the T2 chip decides which one to load during boot.</p><p>If the attack is able to alter your hardware (or sneak in a malicious USB-C cable), it would be possible to achieve a semi-tethered exploit.</p><p>While this may not sound as frightening, be aware that this is a perfectly possible attack scenario for state actors.
I have sources that say more news is on the way in the upcoming weeks. I quote: <em>be afraid, be very afraid</em>.</p><h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2><pre><code># install devtools
$ xcode-select --install

# check the script &amp; install homebrew

</code></pre><h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2><p>I’ve reached out to Apple concerning this issue on numerous occasions, even doing the dreaded cc <em>tcook@apple.com</em> to get some exposure.
Since I did not receive a response for weeks, I did the same to numerous news websites that cover Apple, but no response there as well.
In hope of raising more awareness (and an official response from Apple), I am hereby disclosing almost all of the details.
You could argue I’m not following responsible disclosure, but since this issue has been known since 2019, I think …</p></div></div></div>

<section itemprop="text">
<p>I recently discovered a way to set up VSCode on Google Colab and use it as an editor to write code and run experiments on the Colab VM.</p>
<p>With this setup, you can still prototype in the Colab Notebook while also using VSCode for all the advantages of a full-fledged code editor. Here is how you can replicate my setup.</p>
<h2 id="approach-1-python-package">Approach 1: Python Package</h2>
<p>In this setup, we use the <a href="https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/colabcode">colab-code</a> package that automates all the manual setup steps previously described in the <strong>Approach 2</strong> section of this blog post. You can make a copy of this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/abhishekkrthakur/colabcode/blob/master/colab_starter.ipynb">notebook</a> directly to get started.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, install the <code>colab-code</code> package using the following command:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Now, import <code>ColabCode</code> class from the package and specify the port and password.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> <span>from</span> <span>colabcode</span> <span>import</span> <span>ColabCode</span>
 <span>ColabCode</span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>=</span><span>10000</span><span>,</span> <span>password</span><span>=</span><span>"password123"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div> </div>
<p>You can also use it directly with the default port and without any password as shown below.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> <span>from</span> <span>colabcode</span> <span>import</span> <span>ColabCode</span>
 <span>ColabCode</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will get the ngrok URL in the output. Click the link and a login page will open in a new tab.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-code-step-1.png" alt="Generated NGROK URL"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type the password you had set in step 2 and click submit. If the page gets stuck for more than 4-5 seconds, refresh the page and you should be redirected to the editor.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-code-step-2.png" alt="Authenticating with password in VSCode"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you will get access to the editor interface and can use it to work on python files.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-code-step-3.png" alt="VSCode Interface"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="approach-2-manual-setup">Approach 2: Manual Setup</h2>
<p>I have described the setup steps in detail below. After going through all the steps, please use this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yvUy5Gn9lPjmCQH6RjD_LvUO2NE0Z7RM?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a> to try it out directly.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, we will install the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a> package to run VSCode editor as a web app. Copy and run the following command on colab to install <code>code-server</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> !curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the installation is complete, we will expose a random port <code>9000</code> to an external URL we can access using the <code>pyngrok</code> package. To install <code>pyngrok</code>, run</p>
<div><div><pre><code> <span>!</span>pip <span>install</span> <span>-qqq</span> pyngrok
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, run the following command to get a public ngrok URL. This will be the URL we will use to access VSCode.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> <span>from</span> <span>pyngrok</span> <span>import</span> <span>ngrok</span>
 <span>url</span> <span>=</span> <span>ngrok</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>=</span><span>9000</span><span>)</span>
 <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, we will start the VSCode server in the background at port 9000 without any authentication using the following command.</p>
<div><div><pre><code> !nohup code-server --port 9000 --auth none &amp;
</code></pre></div> </div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, you can access the VSCode interface at the URL you got from step 3. The interface and functionality are the same as the desktop version of VSCode.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-vscode.png" alt="Example of a running instance of VSCode server"></p>
<h2 id="usage-tips">Usage Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can switch to the dark theme by going to the bottom-left corner of the editor, clicking the <strong>settings icon</strong>, and then clicking ‘<strong>Color Theme</strong>’.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-dark-theme-step-1.png" alt="Switching to dark theme on VSCode"></p>
<p>A popup will open. Select <strong>Dark (Visual Studio)</strong> in the options and the editor will switch to a dark theme.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/colab-dark-theme-step-2.png" alt="Theme selection interface on VSCode"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the keyword shortcuts of regular VSCode works with this. For example, you can use <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> to open a popup for various actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/vscode-ctrl-shift-p.png" alt="Action popup in VSCode"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To open a terminal, you can use the shortcut <code>Ctrl + Shift + `</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/vscode-terminal.png" alt="Opening integrated terminal in VSCode"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get python code completions, you can install the Python(<code>ms-python</code>) extension from the extensions page on the left sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/vscode-code-completions.png" alt="Installing extensions in VSCode"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Colab interface is still usable as a notebook and regular functions to upload and download files and mount with Google Drive. Thus, you get the benefits of both a notebook and a code editor.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Starting an IHP app</strong>

                    <p>
                        Let's first take a look at what happens when you start your IHP app by running <code>./start</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-boilerplate/blob/master/start" target="_blank"><code>./start</code></a> script in your project is basically just a small wrapper that makes sure that all dependencies that are managed by nix are available and then calls the <code>RunDevServer</code> binary. <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/exe/IHP/IDE/DevServer.hs" target="_blank">This binary is part of IHP</a> and does the actual application startup as well as managing the postgres server.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can think of <code>RunDevServer</code> as a small process manager. When <code>RunDevServer</code> is started, it will directly start all processes required for your application to run:
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>the web-based IDE</li>
                            <li>a status server on port 8000 showing the compiler status and possible type errors</li>
                            <li>a websocket server used for communicating file changes for live reloading</li>
                            <li>a ghci (the standard haskell REPL) where it directly loads your app</li>
                            <li>a postgres server bound to unix socket</li>
                            <li>a file watcher to track haskell and css file changes</li>
                        </ul>
                    

                    <p>
                        All these processes are started in parallel for fast performance and synchronised in the main event loop of the dev server. Made possible thanks to haskells great concurrency capabilities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important process is the ghci process with your app. Instead of fully recompiling your app on every file change, IHP loads your app in the repl and then refreshes only the changed files. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At first ghci needs a couple of seconds to load all haskell files of your application. While loading your application the status server is serving all http requests on localhost:8000. The status server will also show all type errors in case ghci failed to load your app. When the ghci finished loading, the status server is stopped and your application is started on localhost:8000.
                    </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Haskell File Changes</strong>

                    <p>
                        Once your application is started, the dev server mainly deals with file changes. Using a file watcher the dev server is notified about any changes to your haskell files in your project. When a haskell file is changed the app process running in the ghci process is stopped and a refresh (<code>:r</code>) is triggered. The refresh is usually very fast. Once completed the app server will be started again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the haskell app has started, open browser pages will be notified using a websocket connection. The open pages will fetch the current page via ajax and will then update the dom using <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom" target="_blank">a diff and patch approach</a>. So only dom nodes that have actually changed will be touched during the live reloading. This approach will keep existing page state like scroll position or text typed into a form field. It allows for a very fast and productive feedback cycle.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>CSS File Changes</strong>

                    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ihp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ihp</a> also supports live reloading of CSS. <a href="https://t.co/uRCCr3gkHz">pic.twitter.com/uRCCr3gkHz</a></p>— digitally induced (@digitallyinduce) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitallyinduce/status/1277583045919375363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote> 
                    

                    <p>
                        IHP also supports live reloading of CSS files. Once IHP sees a file change to your CSS files in the <code>static</code> directory it will notify all open browser tabs using its websocket connection. Once notified in the browser IHP will look for any <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code> and <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/blob/master/lib/IHP/static/livereload.js#L68" target="_blank">will reload the css file using a cache buster</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is only possible because nix allows us to pin down the set of package definitions to a specific git commit of the nix package registry.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Type Errors</strong>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you make a change which will stop your application from compiling. In these error cases the status server jumps in and starts listening on localhost:8000. The status server will then display the error message so you can quickly fix it:
                    </p>

                    <img src="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/releases/v07082020.png" alt="Example of a status server error message">

                    <p>
                        Additionally open browser tabs will be notified about this and will refresh. This way the error is instantly visible to you.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Batteries-included</strong>

                    <p>
                        While the above steps are technically complicated, when doing actual development you will not see much of this complexity.  Lots of time have been spent to find the best approach and smoothing out all the edge cases. The whole process is very much inspired by PHP where you just make file changes and it works. The live reloading really <q>just works</q>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The dev server is the heart of IHP and makes the dev process extremely productive. You get all the benefits of type-safety with the development speed you previously only got with scripting languages. If you haven't already it's time to try it out! 🚀
                    </p>

<p>Does writing become more important (relative to coding) as we transition to senior roles? How is writing beneficial in technical positions? How can we help the team write better?</p>
<p>As a data scientist, I find myself straddling between building and deploying ML systems (<em>coding</em>), and communicating proposals and explaining results (<em>writing</em>). What’s the optimal balance between writing code and writing documents?</p>
<p>Here, we’ll discuss these questions and more. I’m also happy to have several friends who will chime in with their lessons and advice:</p>

<h2 id="as-we-grow-how-we-can-contribute-most-shifts">As we grow, how we can contribute <em>most</em> shifts</h2>
<p><strong>At the start of our careers, it’s all about delivery</strong>. We contribute by implementing and delivering systems (via <em>writing code</em>). David describes this aptly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[At the start,] you need to focus on getting your fangs [akin to earning your stripes] on real-world problems. Then, as you get your fangs and grow your career, it becomes more important to share what you know.” – David Said</p>

<p>So as we gain experience and grow our fangs, the way in which we create impact changes. Instead of implementing systems ourselves, it becomes more valuable to <strong>guide and serve the team</strong>. A great way to do this is via <em>writing documents</em>.</p>
<p>One way (to guide the team) is <strong>providing the context and the why</strong>. As we rise in seniority, we gain context—business goals, organization roadmap, budget—that junior members may lack. A straightforward way to increase team effectiveness is sharing this context and helping the team to understand it. With the context, <strong>they can solve the problem better</strong>.</p>
<p>As lead data scientist, Alexey’s role is to connect the different parts of the organization and have a big picture view of the entire system. While he codes less now, he contributes by conveying the big picture and why to the team. He does this through writing documents such as product roadmaps, requirements, API specs, etc. He advises that seeing the context and communicating it becomes more important as our careers progress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you grow from middle to senior level, having context matters. Communicating with other teams matters. Understanding if the customer really wants to use what you’re building matters. This is when writing becomes <em>especially</em> important, through scoping the context and sharing the message.” – Alexey Grigorev</p>
</blockquote>
<details><summary>Focus on sharing the “why”, not the “what” and “how”</summary>
<div>
<p>Assume that we’re part of an e-commerce platform. Popular products get traffic and continue to stay popular; newer long-tail products don’t get traffic and stay obscure (even though they might be good). Instead of communicating the <strong>what</strong> (increase visibility of new products) and the <strong>how</strong> (randomly pick the latest product to rank high), we should communicate the <strong>why</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customers get bored seeing the same products and leave the platform</li>
<li>It’s risky to have a disproportionately large amount of sales concentrated on a small number of sellers and products (i.e., poor seller &amp; assortment health)</li>
<li>New sellers who don’t get traffic and sales get discouraged and leave</li>
</ul>
<p>By sharing the context and the why—and giving space to figure out the what and the how—we empower the team to creatively solve the customer’s problem. In my experience, this almost always leads to a far better outcome than expected.</p>
<p>(In this case, we fixed it with a combination of <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/eugeneyan/how-lazada-ranks-products-to-improve-customer-experience-and-conversion#30" target="_blank">understanding customers unmet demands</a> and providing the ability for sellers to place ads.)</p>
</div>
</details>
<p>Also, with the lessons we’ve learned (read: failures), we can contribute by <strong>helping to look around corners</strong>. We do this by <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-before-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#break-it-down-to-spot-rabbit-holes-and-dead-ends" target="_blank">foreseeing potential pitfalls</a> the team should prioritize early. Or we can suggest (or decide) on problem statements, methodology, and technology. This could involve reviewing design docs and leaving feedback, or writing the design doc and <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-before-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#constraints-how-not" target="_blank">setting boundaries</a>. Thus, our contribution transitions from day-to-day execution to longer-term strategic thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As you become a tech leader, you need to think about the future. The experienced are those who know what the corners are and how to look around them. They have to parse the business problems, do the (design and code) reviews, and minimize the errors that the team commits.” – David Said</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A well-timed insight can save weeks, if not months, of going down the rabbit hole. Unfortunately, the reverse can also happen if recommendations of tech leads are ignored.</p>
<p>In addition, we’ll need to <strong>learn how to scale our impact</strong>. The number of systems we can build ourselves is limited. To increase our impact, we’ll need to gain leverage by working with other people, by working across multiple teams and projects.</p>
<p>Here’s where writing helps. It scales well—once written, an API spec can be easily distributed without additional effort. It clarifies—the same spec can help achieve alignment and unblock multiple teams at once. Also, by writing about the lessons we’ve learned and the how-tos, we pave the way for those who follow our footsteps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As soon as you get into a senior role (maybe not title-wise, but having increased scope), you’ll have to work with others. A great mechanism for this is via documentation. If you’ve always been a coder, you might find this boring. But writing documentation, such as how to deploy <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a>, is tremendously helpful both for yourself and the team.” – Pratik Bhavsar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, this suggests that (as we grow in our careers) we’ll find ourselves <strong>writing more and coding less</strong>. Grace observed that in general, individual contributors (ICs) tend to write more code, while tech leads and managers tend to write more docs. Nonetheless, writing documents is important <em>even</em> if you’re an IC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Both writing docs and writing code are important: Write good code and perform quality analysis, then write good docs to maximize its impact. You need to help stakeholders be aware of and understand your work so it can make an impact. Not sharing your work means no one knows about it and no one can use it.” – Grace Tang</p>
</blockquote>
<details><summary>If you’re mostly writing docs, how can you write more code?</summary>
<div>
<p>If you're a senior member, the team counts on you to provide the strategic long-term vision and roadmap. To do this well, it’s essential to stay grounded on, and understand, the existing systems and codebase.</p>
<p>Consciously think about how to find time to code, perhaps by jumping into a sprint and picking up a task. Choose an area of the design and implementation that you can dig deep into. Focus on tasks with longer-term goals and a lengthier lead time. This way, your work will not become an immediate blocker for the team (when you get waylaid with higher-level tasks that demand your attention).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="writing-has-several-benefits-especially-in-tech-roles">Writing has several benefits, especially in tech roles</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Writing is nature’s way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is.” – Dick Guindon, via Leslie Lamport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without writing, we might believe our designs are sound, our methodology clear, and our understanding complete. Well, trying to write about it will sort that out. Writing is a hack to <strong>gaining clarity</strong>. Here’s Jeff Bezos on why he banned powerpoint (as a medium at meetings) and enforced six-page narratives instead:</p>
<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/jeff-bezos-memo.jpg" title="The fateful email that changed Amazon." alt="The fateful email that changed Amazon."></p>
<p>The fateful email that changed Amazon.</p>
<p>Yes, the audience benefits from reading well-structured narrative. <strong>But the main benefit goes to the writer.</strong> By writing long-form prose instead of bullet points, by adding data and connecting ideas, we’re forced to <em>think deeply and resolve inconsistencies</em>. We have to <em>focus on the single thread</em> that ties everything together. We need to <em>remove redundant details</em> (to fit the page limits). There is no way to write a six-page narrative and not come away with clear(er) thinking.</p>
<p>And even if the document is lost, the research and thinking has already been done. The process and outcomes of the thinking are often more important than the document.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information. Writing the report is important; reading it often is not.” – Andy Grove</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully agree with this and advocate the practice of writing <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/what-i-do-before-a-data-science-project-to-ensure-success/#first-draw-the-map-to-the-destination-one-pager" target="_blank">one-pagers</a>. (In my previous teams, it was a must before starting on a project.) The process helps to clarify the intent, desired outcome, deliverable, and constraints. Such practices are also common in Amazon, such as the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/" target="_blank">working backwards</a> process and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-surprising-way-amazon-decides-what-new-enterprise-products-to-work-on-next-2015-3" target="_blank">press release</a> document.</p>
<p>Also, writing is a short cut to <strong>socializing ideas and getting feedback</strong>. Before starting on (costly) implementation, we can (cheaply) share written proposals to gather feedback. With feedback, our initial designs can be refactored at zero development cost. Sharing our designs—in written form—also ensures our eventual implementation meets the intent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you write your proposal, you have a way to understand if it’s interesting and useful for others. In contrast, you can write code for a very long time and still not know if it’s useful. Thus, writing the proposal is important to helping yourself and others understand if what you’re building is actually solving the problem.“ – Alexey Grigorev</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same documents we write to gain clarity can also be used to socialize our ideas. In Amazon, when asked about a project, it’s common to share the press release document (and the six-pager if it’s available). In other organizations, this could be in the form of a requirements doc, confluence page, or API specifications.</p>
<p>In addition, writing helps with <strong>knowledge retention and transfer</strong>. Our memory is leaky—we forget <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/reading-note-taking-writing/#note-taking" target="_blank">as much as 90% of what we read within 7 days</a>. Writing is like saving knowledge to a database. And now, instead of asking us, people can access our knowledge via that database (i.e., writing)—this helps us save time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you have project documentation, it’s easy to onboard someone onto the project. Instead of having to sit with them to explain it, you can just direct them to the docs. Also, as the organization grows larger, it becomes difficult to …</p></blockquote></div></div>

It’s a really rewarding experience when you design a program from scratch, like the game euchre, and it runs the way you intended. It almost feels like magic!</p><p>But I felt like something was missing.</p><p>Programming is fun, but I’m also a creative person; I’m multi-faceted.

					<div><p>Hello everyone! I’m the other face behind this blog.</p><p>My story of UX is like Zander’s – except I started in the world of fine arts. I’ve always pursued creative endeavors (both in the coding world and visual arts) but I never truly found something that melded these two worlds together in a way that satisfied me.</p><p>In college, I was in the school of Art &amp; Design, but attempted to dual major in Computer Science since I had been dabbling in HTML, CSS, and Visual Basic in High School. Needless to say – it didn’t stick. Programming languages at its core was too far removed from my visual arts side – so I quickly moved on to Front-End Web design within my program.</p></div>

					<div><p>UX design (or user experience design) is the process of improving the experience users have with a product.</p><p>This includes the usability, accessibility, desirability, and value that the product provides.</p></div>

					<div><p>Now that we’ve defined <i>what is UX design</i>, let’s talk about some common UX goals.</p><p>UX design is focused on creating value for a specified group of users.</p><p>Broadly speaking, you will find the term “UX designer” associated with designing digital products. However, the concept is not limited to digital products.&nbsp;</p><p>The kind of value UX design looks to provide ranges from how comfortable a chair feels to how easy it is to navigate a website.</p><p>Some example questions you might ask when it comes to improving your product’s experience are:</p><ul><li>Is my product meeting my users’ needs?</li><li>Do users find my product intuitive?</li><li>Can potential users easily access my product?</li><li>Is my product able to meet a handicap user’s needs?</li><li>Are my competitors’ products meeting my targeted users’ needs better than my own?</li></ul><p>However, experienced UX designers don’t only focus on the product itself. They also keep in mind what a user is doing <i>before</i> using a product and <i>after</i> using a product. This is to understand the whole context of what motivates a user and why they look to use your product.</p><p>Now, you might be asking, “What is UX design doing to help the business?” You might think user experience designers are only focused on users due to the name, but good UX designers represent the user for the business while keeping in mind&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/design-leadership-notebook/why-ux-design-is-a-strategic-business-tool-9184c0feb6c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the business’ technical, logical, financial, and emotional goals.</a></p></div>

			<h3>What disciplines are involved in UX design?</h3>		</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="4978e96" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<div><p>One reason I get the question <i>what is UX design</i> so often is because it’s not just one discipline.</p><p>UX design is both a science and an art. It’s a broad field that involves many disciplines, including aspects of:</p><ul><li><a href="https://masterdesignblog.com/5-psychology-principles-every-ux-designer-should-know/">Psychology</a></li><li>Business</li><li>Coding</li><li>Design</li><li>Technology</li><li>Research.</li></ul><p>However, the disciplines you need to understand vary from project to project.</p><p>For example, a UX designer creating a legal-aiding website will need to do their research on legal rules and collaborate with legal experts for help. Meanwhile, a UX designer creating a clothing website will need to do their research on clothing brands and the psychology of shopping online.</p><p>The disciplines a UX designer needs to know also vary from role to role.</p><p>For example, a UX designer at a large corporation might only need to do visual designing of a product while working with a UX researcher that focuses on the testing with users and usability of a product. Conversely, a UX designer at a small startup might wear multiple hats, having to help with front-end coding, doing research, and designing the product.</p><p>I’ve worked in a range of companies, from large corporations to tiny startups, so I can definitively tell you that you’ll be able to find a UX job that is as narrow or broad as you’d like.</p></div>

That’s why we’ve defined some commonly used terms below.</p><p>I’d like to note that you will often find job roles and titles that overlap with these fields, like a UI/UX designer.</p><h4>UI Design (User Interface Design)</h4><p>UI designers are responsible for making the visual design of a website appealing to users while following a business’ brand guidelines.</p><p>UI designers need to follow a company’s style guide to design an interface that both pleases the user but also meets the business’ visual brand (i.e. they need to make it look consistent).&nbsp;</p><p>That means knowing the sizing of buttons, the colors used to highlight elements on a page, what graphics to use, which font types and sizes are needed, how the business uses icon assets, etc.</p><p>You can find some fun designs for inspiration <a href="https://masterdesignblog.com/50-awesome-examples-of-minimal-mobile-ui-design-app-inspiration/">in this post</a>.</p><h4>IxD (Interaction Design)</h4><div data-id="2c36285" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>Interaction designers make it their goal to make sure that any interactions a user has with a product are simple and smooth.</p></div></div><div data-id="8418b86" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>The interfaces these designers create are logically thought out.

    <p>A few people on twitter have asked me to explain why the USB3 winds up being much harder to implement than USB2.
The answer is more than will fit in a single tweet, so I thought I'd put a quick-but-rough answer, here. This is
by no means comprehensive; consider it <del>a longer tweet</del> what a tweet would be given I had more than 240 characters and a proclivity to babble. (I do.)</p>
<p>A lot of the challenges come from the way we work around <em>physical-layer</em> limitations. Put poetically, physics gives
us lots of little obstacles we have to work around in order to talk at 5 billion transfers per second (5GT/s).</p>
<h5 id="its-hard-to-establish-common-dc-operating-conditions-on-both-sides-of-a-link">It's hard to establish common “DC operating conditions” on both sides of a link.</h5>
<p>It's not trivial to get the same bias voltages – and common grounds – across a long motherboard or down a cable – and when you're operating at really high frequencies, you're a lot more sensitive to changes in your operating environment. In USB3, we work around this by <em>capacitively isolating</em> both sides of the link from each other – in short, we use capacitors to ensure only signal <em>changes</em> are carried across the link, which means that both sides can establish their own local operating conditions.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/why-is-usb3-harder/circuit.png" alt="diagram showing the transmitter is connected to the receiver through a pair of AC coupling capacitors"> <figcaption>
            <h4>From the USB3.2 specification: diagram showing how signals are isolated</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This puts some requirements on the digital protocols used to exchange data. Because data currents are exchanged as the relevant capacitors charge and discharge, <em>capacitive coupling</em> only works when those capacitors have room to charge and discharge. <strong>This means our data must be DC-balanced; we have to spend as much time charging those capacitors as we do discharging them</strong>. In digital terms, this means we have to encode the data in a way that sends the same amount of <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s.</p>
<h5 id="its-hard-to-establish-a-common-clock-across-both-sides-of-a-link">It's hard to establish a “common clock” across both sides of a link.</h5>
<p>When sending serial data, you typically have two challenges: you need to make sure both sides are sampling the data <em>at the same rate</em>, and that both sample clocks are <em>synchronized enough</em> that you're sampling at the right point. Many high-speed protocols deal with this using a technique called <em>clock recovery</em>, which essentially means that each receiver looks at the data it receives and tries to figure out what the clock that produced it looks like.</p>
<p>If both sides have agreed on a clock rate, this can be simple, in theory: if the receiver sees a change in its
received data, it can infer that that changed happened <em>on an active edge of the transmitter's clock</em>, and so it can start to figure out how to align its internal clock with the transmitter's.</p>
<p>This introduces another protocol requirement: <strong>for <em>clock recovery</em> to work, the data has to change frequently enough that the two sides can keep synchronized</strong>. At 5GT/s and high data throughputs, there's not much time for clocks to become synchronized when a packet is received; accordingly, it's important that data is encoded with lots of transitions, even when the line is idle.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure both <em>DC-Balance</em> and <em>sufficient transition density</em>, USB3 uses a method of encoding called 8b10b encoding.</strong>
In this encoding scheme, every single byte of data is transmitted as ten bits, with encodings chosen so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A typical data byte can be transmitted <em>either</em> as a code with <em>one more one than zero</em>, or <em>one more zero than one</em>.
This allows the transmitter to choose between the two encodings, in order to keep the data stream at 50% ones.</li>
<li>Every valid encoding has sufficient <em>transition density</em> to ensure that it's useful for clock recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won't go into more 8b10b background here, but you can read about the typical IBM implementation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8b/10b_encoding">on wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h5 id="its-hard-to-run-both-sides-of-the-link-at-the-same--clock-rate-">It's hard to run both sides of the link at the same <em>clock rate</em>.</h5>
<p>Even with successful <em>clock recovery</em>, it's difficult to have both sides of the link produce and consume data at
the same rate. Each side's internal logic is running off of its own <em>clock source</em>; and every clock has a bit of deviation from its nominal frequency. For the protocol to function despite these differences, the USB3 specification allows each clock to deviate from its nominal value by up to a certain <em>tolerance</em>; and specifies a method for compensating for this tolerance. This technique is appropriately named <em>clock tolerance compensation</em>, or CTC.</p>
<p><strong>To compensate for mismatches in sender/receiver clock rates, USB3 requires senders to periodically insert filler data into their transmitted data-stream</strong>. Receivers can then discard this data; allowing a brief pause in which the slower
side of the link can “catch up”. For this to be useful, the filler data (called ‘skip sets’) must be sent regularly;
which means additional logic on the transmitter side for insertion, and additional logic on the receiver side for
removal.</p>
<h5 id="its-hard-to-deal-with-varying-electrical-properties-of-different-transmitters-receivers-and-cables">It's hard to deal with varying electrical properties of different transmitters, receivers, and cables.</h5>
<p>When operating at very high frequencies, all of the little non-idealities along your transmission path really add up. At slower data rates, there's plenty of time for digital signals to “settle” after a change; making the non-ideal properties of your transmission lines less important. The faster your data gets, the more important it is for your data
to reach a “readable” value quickly.</p>
<p>To help with this, most high-speed receivers employ a technique called <em>receiver equalization</em>, which uses analog hardware
to help reshape signal transitions, so they can be more reliably sampled. Equalization helps to “cancel out” some of the ways the non-ideal transmission path adversely affects the signal.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post-media/why-is-usb3-harder/eye.png" alt="diagram showing a variety of slow rises and falls; illustrating that the physical link slows transitions"> <figcaption>
            <h4>From the USB3.2 specification: an 'eye diagram', which shows an overlay of many rising and falling transitions, illustrating how non-ideal properties affect the link.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since every transmission path is different – due to different transmitter, receiver, and cable properties – it's impossible to create a single “one size fits all” equalizer. Instead, each USB3 equalizer needs to be tuned to its transmission path via a process called <em>link training</em>.</p>
<p><strong>At the start of each USB3 communication, link partners repeatedly exchange collections of known data called <em>training sets</em>, which give the opportunity for each side to tune their equalizer.</strong> Training sets include both sets of data chosen to have high transition density and sets designed to include a wide range of “normally-distributed” data.</p>
<p>During a few milliseconds of data exchange – an eternity in fast-protocol terms – both sides of the link gradually
tweak their equalizer settings until they're clearly seeing the expected values from the other side.</p>
<h5 id="its-hard-not-to-generate-harmful-interference">It's hard not to generate harmful interference.</h5>
<p>USB3 has a very high transition rate – it easily qualifies as high radio-frequency signaling – and its link
often tends to exchange repeating data. This has a nasty side effect: even a well-functioning link can act as an
antenna; unintentionally emitting RF that can interfere with nearby systems. The more repeating elements this signaling
has, the more troublesome the interference tends to be.</p>
<p><strong>To reduce the amount of harmful interference generated, USB3 links use a technique called <em>scrambling</em>, in which data is XOR'd with a fixed pattern before transmission.</strong> The receiver is then capable of applying the same transform to <em>descramble</em> the data stream, recovering the relevant data.</p>
<p>You can think of scrambling as being very similar to encryption – except everyone knows the key. Once data is scrambled, it looks a lot more like “random numbers” than the pre-scrambling data – and accordingly, it's a lot less likely to
generate troublesome interference. Once the scrambled data travels the link, it can be <em>descrambled</em> by the receiving end – a process similar to decryption – restoring the original data stream.</p>
<h5 id="in-summary">In summary…</h5>
<p>In summary, before you can even exchange meaningful data, the digital side of your device needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8b10b encoding and decoding hardware</strong>, so the data exchanged is <em>DC-balanced</em> and contains sufficient transitions as to allow <em>clock recovery</em>;</li>
<li><strong>Clock Tolerance Compensation hardware</strong>, which allows the two sides to communicate even with slightly-varying clock frequencies;</li>
<li>Hardware to orchestrate <strong>link training</strong> and <strong>receiver equalization</strong>, which helps to deal with non-ideal transmission properties;</li>
<li><strong>Scrambling</strong> and <strong>descrambling</strong> hardware, which help to reduce harmful interference.</li>
</ul>
<p>This omits a few minor things, such as USB3's <em>Low Frequency Periodic Signaling</em>; but these are the major components.</p>
<h5 id="oh-and-one-more-thing-its-hard-to-get-good-resources">Oh, and one more thing: it's hard to get good resources.</h5>
<p>Finally, ignoring all the physical layer challenges associated with bringing a link up, there's one more major obstacle: it's hard to get good resources for working with USB3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most hardware enabling custom USB designs is expensive; and <a href="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/">still rife with issues</a>.</li>
<li>Most USB3 tooling is <a href="https://www.totalphase.com/products/beagle-usb5000-v2-ultimate/">very expensive</a>, and still rife with issues.</li>
<li>There's very little documentation in support of the specification; and what documentation exists still hasn't been
used enough to <a href="https://lab.ktemkin.com/post/mindshare-usb3/">identify all of its errors</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, at some point, I'll have built enough tooling to change this.</p>
