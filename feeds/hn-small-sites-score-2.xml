<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>Thai Duong–author of the BEAST attack against SSL/TLS, among <a href="https://github.com/google/tink">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof">things</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>



<figure><div>

</div><figcaption>The Dunning-GNUger Effect.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

July 13, 2020 | https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/gui.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/gui.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" <p=""><p>Lisp has a long and rich history and so does the development of
Graphical User Interfaces in Lisp. In fact, the first GUI builder was
written in Lisp (and sold to Apple. It is now Interface Builder).</p>

<p>Lisp is also famous and unrivalled for its interactive development
capabilities, a feature even more worth having to develop GUI
applications. Can you imagine compiling one function and seeing your
GUI update instantly? We can do this with many GUI frameworks today,
even though the details differ from one to another.</p>

<p>Finally, a key part in building software is how to build it and ship
it to users. Here also, we can build self-contained binaries, for
the three main operating systems, that users can run with a double
click.</p>

<p>We aim here to give you the relevant information to help you choose
the right GUI framework and to put you on tracks. Don’t hesitate to
<a href="https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/">contribute</a>, to
send more examples and to furnish the upstream documentations.</p>



<p>In this recipe, we’ll present the following GUI toolkits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> with <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> with <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gtk.org/">Gtk3</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Ferada/cl-cffi-gtk/">cl-cffi-gtk</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> with <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you might want to have a look to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/capi.html">CAPI</a> toolkit (Common Application Programming Interface),
which is proprietary and made by LispWorks. It is a complete and cross-platform
toolkit (Windows, Gtk+, Cocoa), very praised by its users. LispWorks
also has <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/products/lw4mr.html">iOS and Android
runtimes</a>. Example
software built with CAPI include <a href="https://opusmodus.com/">Opusmodus</a>
or again <a href="https://scorecloud.com/">ScoreCloud</a>. It is possible to
try it with the LispWorks free demo.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/plkrueger/CocoaInterface/">CocoaInterface</a>, a
Cocoa interface for Clozure Common Lisp. Build Cocoa user interface
windows dynamically using Lisp code and bypass the typical Xcode
processes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/mcclim/">McCLIM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/earl-ducaine/cl-garnet">Garnet</a> are toolkit in 100% Common Lisp. McClim even has <a href="https://techfak.de/~jmoringe/mcclim-broadway-7.ogv">a prototype</a> running in the browser with the Broadway protocol and Garnet has an ongoing interface to Gtk.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/alloy">Alloy</a>, another very new toolkit in 100% Common Lisp, used for example in the <a href="https://github.com/shinmera/kandria">Kandria</a> game.</li>
  <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/nodgui">nodgui</a>, a fork of Ltk, with syntax sugar and additional widgets.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/eql">eql, eql5, eql5-android</a>, embedded Qt4 and Qt5 Lisp, embedded in ECL, embeddable in Qt. Port of EQL5 to the Android platform.</li>
  <li>this <a href="https://github.com/defunkydrummer/abcl-jazz">demo using Java Swing from ABCL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/mifpasoti/Gtk-Demos">examples of using Gtk without C files with SBCL</a>, as well as GTK-server.</li>
  <li>and, last but not least, <a href="http://ceramic.github.io/">Ceramic</a>, to ship a cross-platform web app with Electron.</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as the other ones listed on <a href="https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#Gui">awesome-cl#gui</a> and <a href="https://www.cliki.net/GUI">Cliki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tk-ltk">Tk (Ltk)</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.tcl.tk/">Tk</a> (or Tcl/Tk, where Tcl is the programming language) has the
infamous reputation of having an outdated look. This is not (so) true
anymore since its version 8 of 1997 (!). It is probably better than
you think:</p>

<p><img src="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/assets/gui/ltk-on-macos.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Tk doesn’t have a great choice of widgets, but it has a useful canvas,
and it has a couple of unique features: we can develop a graphical
interface <strong>fully interactively</strong> and we can run the GUI <strong>remotely</strong>
from the core app.</p>

<p>So, Tk isn’t fancy, but it is an used and proven GUI toolkit (and
programming language) still used in the industry. It can be a great
choice to quickly create simple GUIs, to leverage its ease of deployment, or
when stability is required.</p>

<p>The Lisp binding is <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/">Ltk</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Written in</strong>: Tcl</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets</strong>: this is not the fort of Tk. It has a <strong>small set</strong> of
default widgets, and misses important ones, for example a calendar. We
can find some in extensions (such as in <strong>Nodgui</strong>), but they don’t
feel native, at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interactive development</strong>: very much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other features</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>remote execution</strong>: the connection between Lisp and Tcl/Tk is
done via a stream. It is thus possible to run the Lisp program on
one computer, and to display the GUI on another one. The only
thing required on the client computer is tcl/tk installed and the
remote.tcl script. See <a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/ltkdoc/node46.html">Ltk-remote</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings documentation</strong>: short but complete. Nodgui too.</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: very stable</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: low to non-existent.</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: Tcl/Tk is BSD-style, Ltk is LGPL.</li>
  <li>Example applications:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://notabug.org/cage/fulci/">Fulci</a> - a program to organise your movie collections.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/mijohnson99/ltk-small-games">Ltk small games</a> - snake and tic-tac-toe.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents">cl-torrents</a> - searching torrents on popular trackers. CLI, readline and a simple Tk GUI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>List of widgets</strong></p>

<p>(please don’t suppose the list is exhaustive)</p>

<pre><code>Button Canvas Check-button Entry Frame Label Labelframe Listbox
Menu Menubutton Message
Paned-window
Radio-button Scale
Scrollbar Spinbox Text
Toplevel Widget Canvas

Ltk-megawidgets:
    progress

<p>Nodgui adds:</p>

<pre><code>treelist tooltip searchable-listbox date-picker calendar autocomplete-listbox
password-entry progress-bar-star notify-window
dot-plot bar-chart equalizer-bar
swap-list
</code></pre>



<p>Do we need to present Qt and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/index.html">Qt4</a>? Qt is huge and contains
everything and the kitchen sink. Qt not only provides UI widgets, but
numerous other layers (networking, D-BUS…).</p>

<p>Qt is free for open-source software, however you’ll want to check the
conditions to ship proprietary ones.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools">Qtools</a> bindings target Qt4. The Qt5 Lisp bindings are
yet to be created.</p>

<p>A companion library for Qtools, that you’ll want to check out once you
made your first Qtool application, is
<a href="https://github.com/Shinmera/qtools-ui">Qtools-ui</a>, a collection of
useful widgets and pre-made components. It comes with short

<h2 id="iup-lispnikiup">IUP (lispnik/IUP)</h2>

<p><a href="http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/">IUP</a> is a cross-platform GUI toolkit actively developed
at the PUC university of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It uses <strong>native
controls</strong>: the Windows API for Windows, Gtk3 for GNU/Linux. At the
time of writing, it has a Cocoa port in the works (as well as iOS,
Android and WASM ones). A particularity of IUP is its <strong>small API</strong>.</p>

<p>The Lisp bindings are <a href="https://github.com/lispnik/iup/">lispnik/iup</a>. They are nicely
done in that they are automatically generated from the C sources. They
can follow new IUP versions with a minimal work and the required steps
are documented. All this gives us good guarantee over the bus
factor.</p>

<p>IUP stands as a great solution in between Tk and Gtk or Qt.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: C (official API also in Lua and LED)</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: Windows and Linux, work started for
Cocoa, iOS, Android, WASM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets choice</strong>: medium.</p>

    <p><strong>Other features</strong>: OpenGL, Web browser (WebKitGTK on GNU/Linux), plotting, Scintilla text editor</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings documentation</strong>: good examples and good readme, otherwise low.</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: alpha (but fully generated and working nicely).</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: low but steady, and reactive to new IUP versions.</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: IUP and the bindings are MIT licenced.</li>

<h2 id="nuklear-bodge-nuklear">Nuklear (Bodge-Nuklear)</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI">immediate-mode</a> GUI toolkit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear">Nuklear</a> is a minimal-state, immediate-mode graphical user interface toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default render backend or OS window/input handling but instead provides a highly modular, library-based approach, with simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends, it focuses only on the actual UI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>its Lisp binding is <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-nuklear">Bodge-Nuklear</a>, and its higher level companions <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui">bodge-ui</a> and <a href="https://github.com/borodust/bodge-ui-window">bodge-ui-window</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Nuklear allows the developer to take
over the rendering loop or the input management. This might require
more setup, but it makes Nuklear particularly well suited for games,
or for applications where you want to create new controls.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Framework written in</strong>: ANSI C, single-header library.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Portability</strong>: where C runs. Nuklear doesn’t contain
platform-specific code. No direct OS or window handling is done in
Nuklear. Instead <em>all input state has to be provided by platform
specific code</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Widgets choice</strong>: small.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Graphical builder</strong>: no.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Other features</strong>: fully skinnable and customisable.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bindings stability</strong>: stable</li>
  <li><strong>Bindings activity</strong>: active</li>
  <li><strong>Licence</strong>: MIT or Public Domain (unlicence).</li>
  <li>Example applications:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit">Trivial-gamekit</a></li>

                <h2><a href="https://blog.philipp-trommler.me/posts/2020/07/13/security-possible-gitlab-hack-johnyj12345/" rel="bookmark">Possible Gitlab Hack</a></h2>
                <p>Today I noticed a new and unknown user on our company's Gitlab
instance: "johnyj12345". We immediatly took down our instance as it
seems as if that Johny was able to extract our secrets. You should
probably do so, too.</p>
                <p><i>Published <time datetime="2020-07-13T12:05:42+02:00">Monday, 13 July 2020</time> by <a href="https://blog.philipp-trommler.me/author/philipp-trommler.html">Philipp Trommler</a>. This article has also been translated to: <a href="https://blog.philipp-trommler.me/de/posts/2020/07/13/security-possible-gitlab-hack-johnyj12345/" hreflang="de">de</a>.</i></p>
                <p>Searching the web <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=johnyj12345">for the
username</a> (attention: Google link!)
reveals that many self-hosted Gitlab instances are affected. The publicly
visible procedure is always the same: Johny creates one or more issues that are
linked with each other and at the end of the link cascade there's either an
attached file or a link to a file which holds Gitlab's <code>secrets.yml</code>.</p>
<p>From the web search it seems like the hack started on Saturday, though that may
be a false conclusion. In any case, you should probably take down your Gitlab
instance if you're affected since the <code>secrets.yaml</code> contains Gitlab's base key
and the database encryption key which should better be private AFAIK. This may
or may not be an immediate attack surface, but better safe than sorry,
especially since the files can be easily found via Google.</p>
<p>We're currently looking for a sane and safe way of rotating the keys within that
file. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

    <article id="articleContent">
        <p>Harvard University announced that next academic year will be 100% online.</p>
<p>And the tuition won’t be a dime cheaper.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/images/harvard.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why does it matter?</p>
<p>I don’t want to question the worthiness of such an investment. Yet, I can’t help but wonder if you’ll loose some of your returns by switching from the Harvard University halls to your web browser.</p>
<p>When you give $50.000 to a University like Harvard, you’re paying for a bunch of stuff. Mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prestige</li>
<li>The network (your network is your net worth, right?)</li>
<li>Learning, obviously</li>
</ul>
<p>How will the new experience impact these aspects?</p>
<p>The prestige will stay intact. You can show off your Harvard badge on LinkedIn without having to specify where you studied.</p>
<p>I don’t think that you’ll get exposure to the same network as with physical classes. Human connection is paramount to build strong social ties. Yes, you can talk to people trough Zoom and stuff. But let’s stop hiding: Zoom is a poor quality proxy for face to face interaction. Hopefully when Covid will be over students will catch up with the social interactions they missed.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about learning now.</p>
<p>For years, online learning has been seen as a “second choice” learning format. Yes, it’s more comfortable and democratic than “real” university learning, but at the cost of some quality. I have to admit, I was guilty myself of this bias a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>By changing medium without touching its price tag, Harvard changed the game. Harvard stated loud and clear that online learning is still learning. And it’s worth as much.</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge win for people like me that work hard to create the best online educational content possible.</p>
<p>This legitimates online learning. It acknowledges that the medium does not devaluate the knowledge, passion and teaching skills of the teacher.</p>
<p>Among all the change that Covid has brought to our lives, some will stick forever. Once the stigma around online learning will be gone, we’ll be left with a more democratic way of learning.</p>
<p>Who has something to teach will be free of sharing his experience without fear. Who wants to improve herself will be free to do so without the entry barriers of the Harvard halls.</p>
<p>And my biggest wish of all: <strong>companies will treat people that built their education online with the same respect of who spent $200.000 to sit in Harvard’s classrooms.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments - Nikola Tesla</p>

July 13, 2020 | https://rubenerd.com/tutorial-sites-treating-freebsd-like-a-linux-distro/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rubenerd.com/tutorial-sites-treating-freebsd-like-a-linux-distro/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>On the Gold Coast in January, Deb Goodkin from the FreeBSD Foundation began her Linux.conf.au talk with an intentionally-provocative slide: <em>FreeBSD, that’s just another Linux distro, right?</em> It was said in jest to highlight what a common misconception it is.</p>
<p>One way this manifests is through introductory FreeBSD guides online, usually on blogs with the words sysadmin, cookbook, or tutorial in their names; you know the ones I’m talking about. Invariably they advise updating the base system and pkgng, then immediately installing bash, nano, htop, lsof, coreutils, proc, and more. Some go as far as aliasing these over the built-in tools, and even setting bash as the root shell. From then on, you barely have to touch the FreeBSD userland.</p>
<p>Like a poorly-maintained cheese utensil, this used to grate. If you’re installing an entire GNU toolchain, why not use a Linux distribution, or Debian/kFreeBSD, or a Nexenta-like OS that’s built specifically for those tools? You’re not learning about FreeBSD’s features, nor are you taking advantage of any of its benefits beyond the kernel and base. It’s wasted opportunity, and could render future project contributions more difficult because of misunderstood assumptions about how the system works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/usebsd-pillow@2x.jpg 2x" alt="A photo of a pillow saying: Use BSD"></p>
<p>I’ve since changed my tune somewhat, with a caveat. I also want to take this opportunity— not a sponsor—to spruik Jay Patel’s <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jaypatelani/shop">RedBubble store</a> for your BSD laptop and loungeroom. I’ve already added some to next sticker batch.</p>
<p>What was I talking about?</p>
<p>We should be encouraging Linux people to try FreeBSD, and if giving them their familiar tooling gets their foot in the door, it’s worth it. I personally learn things the quickest by jumping in the deep end, but I know others want to take things a step at a time.</p>
<p>What also gets lost in the fray is FreeBSD, even with all those Linux-focused tools, is still a compelling and useful operating system. It’s a feature not a bug to be able to have all these tools available, and at times run them faster than Linux could on the same hardware. It may even integrate better into shops that otherwise entirely run Linux, given the motivation to write portable, POSIX-compliant code and applications is no longer a priority for most people (sadface).</p>
<p>So rather than saying those guides aren’t useful or even misrepresent FreeBSD, we need to reframe them. Instead of <em>introductions to FreeBSD</em>, say they’re <em>FreeBSD for Linux people</em>. This shouldn’t be constued as criticism; the latter kinds of post would be <em>hugely</em> useful. It’s also then easier to introduce BSD-specific tools and ideas, either inline after each Linuxism you introduce, or in a follow-up post where you compare and contrast.</p>
<p>We need more bridge-building and outreach between the two communities, and anything to make FreeBSD relatable to people coming from Linux, or any other operating system, is useful.</p>

The first blocks of the campus were laid by a small team of enthusiastic students and the project has since then mushroomed to include all buildings on campus, a secret underground labyrinth which players need to find, a treasure hunt for the 17 SDGs (de UN Sustainable Development Goals) and much more. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><div><p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span><span>Expansion plans are in the works for the Erasmus Medical Centre and the Erasmus University College.

After a research the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) conducted into the effects of the Corona Crisis on the well-being of its students and staff members, the results strongly pointed towards the need for something to keep the Erasmus community together. People started to feel lonely and missed the ability to socially interact with each other, exactly that what a physical campus is able to provide a podium for. In an attempt to tackle this issue, ErasmusX – a disruptive innovative unit of the university – launched a creative project whereby students and staff could recreate their beloved Woudestein campus in the virtual gaming platform Minecraft. The very first building blocks were laid by members of the student-led Erasmus E-sports Community, and thereafter a professional Minecraft building team helped polish up the final product.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div><div><h2>"What is so unique and creates this sense of truly being there, is that the building is done on a 1:1 scale"</h2></div><div><div><h2>Woudestein: a place to meet friends</h2><p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span><span>To the EUR community, the campus is not just a place you go to in order to study and work. It is a place where you meet your friends (that perhaps have become like family), where you develop yourself as a human being, where you hang out and where you dream about the opportunities life has in store for you. It almost feels like a small village. “This feeling was so apparent when we saw the many emotional reactions from students and colleagues when they first see the virtual campus – they tell us that navigating the campus makes them feel like they are there again”, states Alexander Whitcomb, a project team member. “What is so unique and creates this sense of truly being there, is that the building is done on a 1:1 scale. So walking from one end of the campus to the other with your avatar in Minecraft takes exactly the same amount of time as it would do in real life.“</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div><div><p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span><span>The Minecraft campus has two main purposes. First it will be used for various planned activities such as onboarding all new incoming students during the famous EurekaWeek 2020, virtual tours for prospective students and the ErasmusX team is also exploring the game platform for educational and research purposes. Secondly, the campus is designed as a creative space, a way for students and staff to design their own interactions and discover new, innovative ways of engaging with one another through the virtual campus. The platform will be moderated by the Erasmus E-sports Community and all ideas are welcomed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"><span><span>Ultimately, the campus in Minecraft is there to strengthen the community of Erasmians, in an academic year where physical interactions are limited by Covid-19, and a ‘normal’ university experience remains unavailable until further notice.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Apropos of Apple’s ARM announcment, I thought I might write up a post on a recent bit of code I wrote that specifically looks at ARM64, and its benchmarks on various hardware.</p><p>I’ve been implementing some compact data structures for a project. One of the CPU hotspots for the implementation is the need to run a quick population count across a potentially large bit of memory.</p><p>If you’ve never seen population count before, it’s the count of the number of set 1 bits in a byte (or list of bytes) – for example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">0xF3 == 0b11110011
popCount(0xF3) == 6
</code></pre></div><p>Now, every reasonable x86_64/amd64<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> CPU in the past decade or so has a built-in instruction for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT"><code>POPCNT</code></a>. It works like this (in Go Assembler):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">MOV    $0xF3, R10  // Store a constant
POPCNT   R10, AX   // AX now equals 6
</code></pre></div><p>Go uses the built-in instruction for this in the <code>math/bits</code> via SSA compiler rewrites (which it added in 1.9), but only up to a uint64 at a time; using assembly to loop over a <code>[]byte</code> is considerably more efficient</p><p><a href="https://github.com/tmthrgd"><code>@tmthrgd</code></a> created a really nice little x86_64-assembly-optimized package at <a href="https://github.com/tmthrgd/go-popcount">github.com/tmthrgd/go-popcount</a>. It works great, works around a weird little Intel bug (see the helpful comments) and is still faster than looping and using the Go standard library, which it helpfully benchmarks as well.</p><p>Recently, I picked up one of the new 8GB Raspberry Pi 4s. Loaded it up with the nice new <a href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro 20.06</a> and set up my usual environment. As a test, I wanted to try my latest WIP data structure code.
Of course, the bottleneck was right where I expected it to be: in the population count.</p><h3 id="implementing-it">Implementing it</h3><p>I discovered that ARM64 has a <code>POPCNT</code>-like instruction, logically enough called <code>CNT</code>. I thought, since I’ve been playing with Go assembly for memmove, why not try my hand at the new architecture?</p><p>Go already has the SSA-rewrite for OnesCount on ARM (added in 1.11), but again, only a uint64 at a time. There might be some performance on the table.</p><p><a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0596/a/DDI_0596_ARM_a64_instruction_set_architecture.pdf">Official architecture guide</a> at the ready, I got to work. And there was a lot to learn. Some notes:</p><h4 id="1-its-part-of-the-vector-suite-neon">1. It’s part of the vector suite, NEON</h4><p>NEON is the name for the addition of vector instructions to the ARM architecture, so I’d be working with both an unfamiliar architecture <em>and</em> its vector instructions.</p><p>In x86-land, <code>POPCNT</code> and vectorization are two separate concepts. <code>POPCNT</code>, as an instruction, deals with everyday, 64-bit integer registers, and not the vector registers (even though it appeared approximately the same time as the addition to vector instructions, SSE4)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p><p>ARM/NEON did <code>CNT</code> differently. Since you can load an array of items (say, 16 bytes, in the ARM64 vector registers), <code>CNT</code> will count them individually. In fact, you can <em>only</em> do it in vectors of single bytes.</p><p>So this means that the following signatures are approximately the way to think about it:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>popCountx86</span><span>(</span><span>in</span> <span>uint64</span><span>)</span> <span>uint64</span> <span>// register-at-a-time, 64-bit (8 bytes)
</span><span></span>
<span>func</span> <span>popCountNeon</span><span>(</span><span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>16</span><span>]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>[</span><span>16</span><span>]</span><span>uint8</span> <span>// 16 bytes all counted in parallel.
</span></code></pre></div><p>This ends up being really effective, as it turns out (below).</p><h4 id="2-gos-assembler-documentation-is-barebones">2. Go’s assembler documentation is barebones</h4><p>Writing instructions so that Go’s assembler is happy with the instructions you’re giving it is a bit frustrating.</p><p>There’s a good gloss at <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/">golang.org/pkg/cmd/internal/obj/arm64</a> which gives an overview of many of the differences.
For example, all vector instructions start with <code>V</code>, different than what ARM64 switched to (they used to commonly start with V on 32-bit ARM) – so while I understand the desire for continuity (and even subtly like it, knowing it’s a vector op) it’s just makes another little difference to remember vs. the original documentation.</p><p>But more frustrating is, even if your instruction is supported (and most of them are) knowing how to <em>use</em> the instruction in Go assembler boils down to “assume data goes left-to-right and hope there’s an example <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/cmd/asm/internal/asm/testdata/arm64enc.s">in the test suite</a>”</p><p>I’m a big Go fan, yet Go’s history into Plan 9 and accompanying assembler (and, relatedly, odd calling conventions) is one of my gripes about Go, even more than lack of generics (which is a topic for another day).
Sure, there were some good ideas in Plan 9 that influenced the design of Go – from a design level, it’s great! – but on the implementation level, this is one place where I kinda wish it had followed precident.
Take whichever side you want in the Intel vs GNU syntax debate, <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">creating a third option</a> means relearning all the quirks from scratch, and ignoring any documentation that already exists.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3><p>The end result is my friendly fork of <code>go-popcount</code>: <a href="https://github.com/barakmich/go-popcount">github.com/barakmich/go-popcount</a></p><p>Really, it’s more of an extension than a fork – it provides the same API, just with handwritten assembly for ARM64 chips.</p><h4 id="how-it-works">How it works</h4><p>The vectorization works really well. The process is:</p><ul><li>Load a set of vector registers, 16 bytes each</li><li>popCount them</li><li>Vector sum their partial results (up to 32 individual vectors, to fit the 8-bit counts), trying to avoid a data dependency</li><li>Finally, sum (“widening”, in vector terms) the final vector</li><li>Add it to the final output</li></ul><p>The other thing to balance was how much to load from memory vs. how much work to do to optimize throughput. That ended up being about 8 vectors (128 bytes) at a time.
That may vary as a function of CPU, but it’s a good place to start.</p><h4 id="arm64-feels-nice">ARM64 feels nice</h4><p>This is purely subjective, but there were a number of moments where I felt “hey, that’s handy” in writing ARM64 assembly.
Of course modern x86_64 chips account for all of these differences and makes them performant – through deeper instruction pipelines or having <a href="http://sunnyeves.blogspot.com/2009/07/intel-x86-processors-cisc-or-risc-or.html">micro-op instruction queues</a> that ultimately pull the same tricks.
But at the same time, when you’re dropping down to work at the instruction level, it’s kind of a breath of fresh air.</p><h5 id="pre-and-post-increment">Pre-and-post increment</h5><p>A lot of the time when you’re working with an array of whatever you’re pulling a chunk of memory into registers, doing some transform, and putting it back.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="asm"><span>VLD1.P</span> <span>64</span><span>(</span><span>R1</span><span>),</span> <span>[</span><span>V16.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V17.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V18.B16</span><span>,</span> <span>V19.B16</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Reads as load 1-byte*size structures into the following vector registers – so far so good, this is similar to the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/movdqu:vmovdqu8:vmovdqu16:vmovdqu32:vmovdqu64"><code>VMOVDQU</code></a> instruction family (though the size-structure variants on that instruction are a recent addition) on x86. It has a similar ability to load many registers in multiple back-to-back instructions through address/offset/size calculation, but ARM has a nice one-liner that way.</p><p>But I really like the auto-increment of <code>R1</code> by the read size (64) after loading – hence post-increment. Many loads from memory have a similar flag. It’s very descriptive and means things like “increment the offset register and decrement the size register and test” things live with their appropriate parts of the code, instead of having to increment later (and finding the optimal time)</p><h5 id="consistency-of-style">Consistency of style</h5><p>This is a holdover from history, but the consistency of having fixed-size instructions is a nice thing when trying to hand-assemble an instruction. I had to do some hand-assembly when <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39445">I discovered and reported a bug in Go</a>. It was silently writing the wrong version of the instruction while accepting the correct one as input. Kudos to the Go community – it was fixed by an expert within a day or two, so I’m looking forward to the next version that contains the fix!</p><p>Still, this meant with a <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">steady hand</a> and a copy of <a href="https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0596/a/DDI_0596_ARM_a64_instruction_set_architecture.pdf">the architecture guide</a> I could feasibly implement any instructions that were missing.</p><p>Also in consistency-land, most binary operations take <code>input1_reg, input2_reg, output_reg</code> with few exceptions. Omitting the output_reg is Go’s assembler syntactic sugar to set output to input2. x86, again for historical reasons (trying to keep instructions small), often has the store-to-the-second-register as the primary or only version of an operation, which can lead to more operations overall (and cognitive overhead IMO).</p><h3 id="benchmarking-on-arm">Benchmarking on ARM</h3><p>So let’s take a look at some benchmarks.
The most interesting thing about looking at population count is that this little routine does something useful and shows tradeoffs between CPU bounds and memory bandwith between the CPU, the on-chip caches, and main memory.
At array sizes small enough to fit into CPU cache (but big enough to run the compute loop a few times), the CPU is the limiting factor – how many bits it can count.
For larger data sizes, the memory bandwidth becomes the bound; the CPU is waiting on getting enough data to crunch through.</p><p>To this end, the benchmark curves in the repository max out in throughput at about 16K (most work possible, while still being in cache) and then trail down into a steady state as memory becomes the bound. So I’ll truncate the full benchmarks to compare peak throughput and long tail.</p><p>Some findings and commentary:</p><h4 id="raspberry-pi-4">Raspberry Pi 4</h4><div><pre><code data-lang="text">Unoptimized (Go implementation):
BenchmarkCountBytesGo/16K              297778          8056 ns/op     2033.78 MB/s
BenchmarkCountBytesGo/512M                  8     279380432 ns/op     1921.65 MB/s

Optimized (My hand-rolled assember):
BenchmarkCountBytes/16K                520807          2303 ns/op     7113.24 MB/s
BenchmarkCountBytes/512M                    8     131214574 ns/op     4091.55 MB/s
</code></pre></div><p>This was my finished product on my local Pi. I may be able to do better, but varying the block sizes between grabbing from memory and doing the vector addition for popcount topped out about here, so I’m fairly satisfied.</p><p>Interestingly, the ~4.1GB/s memory bandwidth follows exactly with <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/10/raspberry-pi-4-benchmarks-processor-and-network-performance-makes-it-a-real-desktop-contender/">initial read benchmarks of the Pi 4</a> suggesting it’s close to saturation, which is good news.</p><h4 id="ampere-emag">Ampere eMag</h4><p>So my next thought was to spin up an ARM64 server with my old friends at <a href="https://packet.net/">Packet</a>.

        <h2>
            On the Consolidation of the Web
            <span>Wed 29 July 2020</span>
        </h2>

        <p>In recent years, the web has been consolidating. From the servers to the apps, a growing majority of the web is controlled by a small pool of companies. When AWS was founded in 2006 I was just starting out with my first VPS, running this blog on WordPress (the good ol' days!). For the last 10 years I have part-run a small VPS (“cloud server”) host called <a href="https://afterburst.com/">Afterburst</a>. Throughout these years I have watched this consolidation, and these are my observations.</p>

<h3>The Pre-Cloud Days</h3>

<p>Way back in 2009 blogs were booming. The market for personal servers was growing rapidly. People often used forums (remember those?) to find providers. Providers would compete to attract the most eyeballs to their sale posts.</p>

<p>The quality and cost of hosting varied wildly. During summer there would be a huge influx of budget “summer hosts” during school holidays. The majority of these would then fold only two months later. Thinking back, it was The While West. Of course there were big players; but the smaller hosts had the cheapest offers and captured the market for personal servers.</p>

<p>I believe that this was a great market for all. Buyers had a wealth of choice of companies tiny to massive. Providers were kept in check by thriving forum communities, leading to better services. The smaller providers would offer a personal touch, often partaking in forums alongside their customers. To me, this was an amazing environment in which I learnt a huge amount about servers but also customer service.</p>

<h3>The Clouds Ascend</h3>

<p>The VPS market was exploding when we started Afterburst in 2010. Shared hosting/PHP was stagnating and the prices had bottomed out. Shared hosting was consolidating fast, hosts were folding daily. Dedicated server and VPS markets remained strong and WebHostingTalk (our “home” forum) was buzzing with activity. The competition for the best VPS was in full swing.</p>

<p>And then came DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>When DO arrived in 2011 everything changed. They managed to make the much hyped “cloud” accessible to everyone where AWS had so far struggled. You could click a button and have a cloud server available within minutes. The all-SSD package, “cloud” marketing and a wave of free launch coupons caused them to explode onto the scene.</p>

<p>It was fascinating to watch the “cloud” hype train. “Cloud servers” were, almost overnight, seen as superior to “VPS”. This is despite most “cloud server” providers offering nothing different to VPS. Now I totally get that The Cloud goes way beyond servers. The offerings today include a staggering number of services. But an individual looking for a server to host their blog? They don’t need any of that, just the server space.</p>

<p>In the years since DO arrived they, AWS and later Azure/GCloud boomed. Cloud was/is the future - we must move everything “to the cloud” many a huge tech company would say. As much as it was marketing hype, the individual started to follow. The cloud was only a little more expensive and came with fancy UI and excellent developer tooling. It was cool to be using the cloud. The small/traditional VPS provider market began to slow, and later reduce. The golden days were over.</p>

<p>Whilst this was very frustrating at the time it also forced us to review and improve our marketing and customer experience. We started marketing cloud servers and optimised the checkout and customer sign-up flow. The competition led to an improved service for existing and new customers.</p>

<h3>So - where are we now?</h3>

<p>10 years later, we’re still here! The consolidation of providers has slowed and many continue to survive. Forums like WHT struggle on but are shadows of their former selves. There’s still a market for individual servers - people have a natural desire to tinker in ways that specific services cannot provide.</p>

<p>I think there will remain a cohort of individual bloggers and websites. But I also believe the web is dividing. On one side a small number of platforms the vast majority of “normal” people consume from and share to. And elsewhere a separate “old style” web of fragmented loosely connected websites/forums/blogs formed by those who tinker. Perhaps something will merge the two together in the future.</p>

<p>It’s like supermarkets consuming ‘Mom and Pop shops’, a trend that goes back decades now. Yet small greengrocers and butchers still live on. There are signs of people returning to these shops in growing numbers. Perhaps this is the start of a reverse trend, could the web follow suit? I’d like to think so.</p>

<p>TL;DR: <em>Companies that have recently gone fully-remote can draw inspiration from open source. Doing so provides helpful ways to think about attracting talent and building culture.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>Fully-Distributed is Taking Off</strong></p>



<p>Though the headlines have focused on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/tech/work-from-home-companies/index.html" target="_blank">big name companies</a> and their announcements about going remote, events of the last four months have undoubtedly created a lot of new fully-distributed companies you’ve <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/videos/20200622091038913/" target="_blank">never heard of</a>. This includes organizations that may have been partially or even fully-colocated (office-based) before Coronavirus. And this is happening in part because remote working has worked out so well for so many of them, and in part because it has proven difficult for many companies to scale down to a “reduced” real estate footprint — to serve a subset of their employees. Hybrid is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/remote-work-having-moment-future-isnt-hybrid-sid-sijbrandij/" target="_blank">harder</a> than fully-distributed, we keep hearing. And the truth is that returning to the office is still an open discussion (fraught with overwhelming <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/business/virus-office-workplace-return.html" target="_blank">emergent</a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/business/virus-office-workplace-return.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> logistical considerations</a>) even for companies that really want to.</p>



<p>We have also no doubt seen in the last four months an acceleration in the rate of creation of new fully-distributed startups that reject offices altogether, and that do not expect their people to meet physically to get work done. This was already a trend, and any founders who may have been hesitant before Coronavirus because they were worried about investor bias or their own inexperience with remote leadership, now have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/oyster/the-dawn-of-the-distributed-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enormous encouragement</a> to kick the office to the curb.</p>



<p>This means, however, that now many, many more companies, not just the ones that were already on the fully-distributed bandwagon before COVID-19, are going to face the challenges unique to fully-distributed organizations.</p>



<p><strong>Next-Level Guidance is Needed</strong></p>



<p>There’s been a great outpouring of new content from the community on the basic how-to’s of remote working. We have also seen that the “bibles of remote working” (that have been around for years from the pioneering remote working companies like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://distributed.blog/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/">Gitlab</a>, and <a href="https://basecamp.com/remote-resources">Basecamp</a>, etc) are getting the reference attention they deserve. These basics (like asynchronous communication) are of course essential principles that have to be properly installed for a fully-distributed team to walk and run. But there are other challenges that come with being a fully-remote organization for which there’s less explicit guidance.</p>



<p>Two such challenges we keep hearing about are:</p>

<p><strong>Open Source, a Model of Distributed Success</strong></p>



<p>To these important challenges of fully-distributed organizations, the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">principles and history of Open Source</a> would seem to offer a lot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We often hear that software “eats” things. An aspect of that is that the ways of software development continue to penetrate into the ways other types of work are done. That open source should provide ways of thinking and working that are helpful to fully-distributed organizations may be yet another example of something that started in software development spreading more generally into business. Like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">Agile</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/kanban/" target="_blank">Kanban</a> have. This keeps happening because these “frameworks from another domain” offer avenues to better ways of working, even when what you’re doing is some other type of knowledge work.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Whether or not they are a software company, fully-distributed organizations are going to have to become more like software companies in their ways of working.</p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=Whether%20or%20not%20they%20are%20a%20software%20company%2C%20fully-distributed%20organizations%20are%20going%20to%20have%20to%20become%20more%20like%20software%20companies%20in%20their%20ways%20of%20working.&amp;url=https://blog.oysterhr.com/2020/07/10/remote-culture-recruiting-open-source/&amp;via=HeyOyster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>This shift will be necessary for non-software development knowledge work to be done well in a fully-distributed organization. Naturally, that has deep implications for how technology will support knowledge work in the future. For that reason, we’re also going to see a pattern where new tools are going to be created that allow non-software developer knowledge workers to work more like developers do. This was also probably a trend well in evidence before Coronavirus, now greatly accelerated.</p>



<p>Once your organization is thinking and working a bit more like a fully-distributed software company (especially if you ARE a software company), it shouldn’t be too difficult to aspire to some of the attributes of an open source project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source is worthy to provide guidance and inspiration to any fully-distributed company because it demonstrates a model through which great talent is not only attracted but also uniquely enabled and remotely synchronized to produce semi-miraculous results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no better example of this than Linux.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Linux was the first project for which a conscious and successful effort to use the entire world as its talent pool was made.”</p><cite><em>Eric Steven Raymond, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s11.html" target="_blank">The Social Context of Open-Source Software</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Successful open source projects like Linux should inspire fully-distributed companies because they demonstrate the extraordinary productivity potential of organized knowledge work performed by a team of people who didn’t ever have to meet in person to accomplish it.</p>



<p><strong>Becoming a Beacon for Global Talent</strong></p>



<p>Organizations who’ve let go of their offices and have recently made the transition to fully-distributed are probably still focused on getting things back on track, and on fostering the healthy continuity of the pre-existing team. Though hiring may not be the present priority, they must surely be thinking about how recruitment will work as a fully-remote company. Whether they are fully-distributed or just have newly-created remote roles, as organizations shift their recruiting perspective from thinking locally to thinking globally, this is going to radically transform the recruiting process as we have known it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for companies that decide they will only hire in a subset of timezones (to facilitate synchronous work, like <a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quora/Remote-First-at-Quora" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quora</a>), the size of the available talent pool would still overwhelm the traditional recruitment approaches of “publishing” their open roles and waiting for “applicants” to express an interest in them. The new pervasiveness of remote working and highly-distributed companies is going to create unprecedented liquidity in the global talent marketplace. This is great for all parties, but it also means that everyone’s game has to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking and acting like an open source project may be a good way for fully-distributed companies to evolve their talent acquisition game. Reflect on the Linux example in a post-Coronavirus talent market. When the most talented individuals can work for any company in the world, how will your company compete? How can your company distinguish itself amongst a much larger number of prospective employers?</p>



<blockquote><p>The downside for employers gaining access to the global talent pool is that they are also suddenly competing with every company in the world for talent.</p><a href="http://twitter.com/share?&amp;text=The%20downside%20for%20employers%20gaining%20access%20to%20the%20global%20talent%20pool%20is%20that%20they%20are%20also%20suddenly%20competing%20with%20every%20company%20in%20the%20world%20for%20talent.&amp;url=https://blog.oysterhr.com/2020/07/10/remote-culture-recruiting-open-source/&amp;via=2hp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet</a></blockquote>



<p>One approach is to become like an open source project, whose first organizing principle is attracting people who care deeply about the same thing. This of course requires knowing what that special thing (of singular and obsessive focus) is for your organization. I think most companies can find their unique <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why</a>, if they try. And I think it’s a good thing that prospective global employers should feel they have to produce a thoughtful and compelling expression of their purpose to compete for global talent.</p>



<p><strong>Creating Culture on Purpose</strong></p>



<p>Perhaps your company is bootstrapping its culture for the first time as a brand new fully-distributed startup. Or perhaps you’re an established organization now transitioning from an office-based culture. Either way, you may as a leader be wondering how to develop and nurture culture when everything is virtual and everyone’s remote.</p>



<p>Attracting people who share a common passion is potentially more than just a way to acquire talent. It can also be a terrific way to instantiate culture. But attracting talent like an open source project, however, is not just about having a clear and compelling purpose. It’s also about calling those talented people to come work on that purpose together in a <strong>particular</strong> way.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Culture is a pattern of basic assumptions — invented, discovered, or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration — that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.”</p><cite><em>Edgar Schein, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agustinazubair.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/13-organizational_culture_and_leadership_3rd_edition-p-4581.pdf" target="_blank">Organizational Culture and Leadership</a></em></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, culture is inherently linked to a particular problem space, and isn’t directly about people or their attributes. Organizational culture is about how people decide to work together on a specific set of problems.</p>



<p>For many office-based companies, the “Our values” plaque that hangs on the wall is just a list of nice ideas. And though that list of values is intended to be the codification of their culture, those values may not relate in any useful way to the work to be done, and therefore probably don’t drive much useful behavior. The experience and the effects of culture, therefore, are organic, accidental, and overly-dependent on physical proximity.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Running a remote work environment effectively, requires amongst other things a deliberate approach to culture development. </p><p>Transitioning from an office to remote is not going to be easy for a lot of companies. The reason for this is leaders took the human proximity, camaraderie, informal comms &amp; ‘water cooler moments’ for granted. </p><p>The majority of CEOs who ran office-based businesses before the pandemic and didn’t invest in their culture unknowingly relied on their office space environment to hold their unwritten culture together.”</p><cite><em>Bretton Putter (via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/BrettonPutter/status/1263829426258817025" target="_blank">Twitter</a>)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>As human beings we abhor vacuums, particularly social ones. This is the reason why, in the face of non-deliberate culture, we are able to “fill in” …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company.

These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people.

At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing.

The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

				<p>Evolutionary psychology is an approach to understand human behavior that combines insights gained from evolutionary biology, the computational sciences and the study of ancestral living conditions. It has been put forward as an opposing view to what Tooby and Cosmides (1992) call the <em>Standard Social Science Model</em> (SSSM), which has dominated the social and behavioral sciences throughout most of the 20th century. According to the SSSM, the mental organization of adult human beings is not caused by human nature. Rather, humans acquire their mental organization almost entirely from their sociocultural and physical environment. Human beings, on this view, only have a minimal amount of innate impoverished drives (like hunger, thirst, sexual motivation, etc.) and, independently of these, a capacity to be socialized through learning.</p>
<p>A prominent argument given in favor of the SSSM is the fact that genetically determined behavior might be maladaptive due to changing environmental conditions, and therefore the mind evolved towards general-purpose and domain-general learning systems. On this view, the phenotype’s behavior is plastic and tailored toward maximizing individual fitness under changing environmental circumstances. The selective pressures of ancestral environments gave rise to this plasticity, but the concrete adaptive problems that have been faced in these environments play only a minor role in explaining the behavior of modern humans. This is the reason why many social scientists study human behavior in modern conditions more or less independently from their evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Evolutionary psychology, in contrast, holds that psychological mechanisms are evolved adaptations to ancestral adaptive problems. An analogy is drawn here between organs in the body and “cognitive programs” or “mental organs”: Analogous to how organs in the body evolved to solve a particular adaptive problem, e.g. digesting food, cognitive programs evolved to solve a particular adaptive information processing problem, e.g. predator/prey distinction, kin detection, language, etc.</p>
<p>In the following, we will break down the individual tenets of evolutionary psychology and review the arguments that are given in support of these tenets. Since not all tenets are shared by all evolutionary psychologists, we will focus here on the formulation given by Cosmides and Tooby (1987) and Tooby and Cosmides (2005). The tenets are not listed explicitly, but can be reconstructed implicitly from these texts. I will go through each tenet in turn and present a reconstruction of the arguments that motivate these tenets.</p>
<h3>Tenet 1: The brain evolved to be a computer that solves information processing problems.</h3>
<p>This tenet is motivated as follows: Environments pose adaptive information processing problems to organisms. Hence, the genes of organisms that successfully solve these information processing problems spread in the gene pool and such organisms are, by definition, computers.</p>
<p>This tenet, Tooby and Cosmides (2005, p. 31) argue, is shared by proponents of the SSSM. Even a domain-general learning mechanism would be an innate information processing mechanism that evolved at some point to solve adaptive problems. For example, operant conditioning presupposes an innate mechanism to alter the probability of behaviors based on their intrinsically reinforcing consequences (like food or pain). Similarly, classical conditioning presupposes innate unconditioned stimuli and a method to calculate contingencies. Consequently, Tooby and Cosmides (2005, p. 32) conclude that “learning is not an alternative explanation to the claim that natural selection shaped the behavior” and that “a behavior can be, at one and the same time, cultural, learned, and evolved”. This means that the commonly perceived controversy between innateness/evolvedness on the one hand and learnedness on the other is based on a false dichotomy. Rather, it is proposed, evolution created programs as learning mechanisms, and these mechanisms are a prerequisite for learning to be able to occur. The disagreement between the SSSM and evolutionary psychology, therefore, only regards the structure of the evolved learning mechanisms, not the question whether such learning mechanisms evolved at all.</p>
<p>When we accept the theory of evolution through natural selection, it arguably becomes theoretically impossible to deny that the brain evolved to be a computer that solves adaptive information processing problems – unless we claim that (A) evolution hasn’t found this path yet, (B) evolution cannot find this path in principle since it would lead through a fitness valley or (C) adaptive problems aren’t information processing problems and therefore a computer would not be the ideal solution. Discussing these possibilities would be beyond the scope of this introduction, so I am going to suppose (A), (B) and (C) to be false for the rest of this discussion. This leads us to accept this tenet.</p>
<h3>Tenet 2: The brain is not a “blank slate” domain-general fitness-maximizing machine.</h3>
<p>Cosmides and Tooby (1987, p. 47) and Tooby and Cosmides (2005, pp. 294- 299) argue that there is no domain-general success criterion that is correlated with fitness and, therefore, a domain-general mechanism would not be successful at actually maximizing fitness and could therefore not have evolved. This argument can be summarized as follows: If no domain-specific innate knowledge is present in the organism, then it can only acquire knowledge that can be inferred from perceptual inputs, without relying on innate perceptual heuristics. Similarly, it can learn behaviors only through trial and error learning, which would amount to generating random sequences of actions, observing the fitness outcome (e.g. the number of produced offspring) and then reinforcing or mitigating behaviors based on this outcome. Proposing instead that the mechanism could rely on perceptual cues like smell or taste as a proxy for expected fitness, they argue, amounts to “admitting domain-specific innate knowledge”.</p>
<p>However, when observing a certain positive or negative fitness outcome (like an increase or decrease in the produced offspring), it is virtually impossible to trace it back to the precise actions or sequences of actions that caused it, since virtually any action taken before in the organism’s life could have caused it. Furthermore, whether a sequence of action promotes fitness is highly context-sensitive. Thus, due to the resulting combinatorial explosion, behaviors cannot reliably be reinforced or mitigated and behavior stays more or less random. Therefore, an organism with adequate innate domain-specific knowledge, perceptual heuristics and perception-action patterns would have a fitness advantage over an organism that only has a domain-general fitness-maximizing mechanism, consequently triggering selection for organisms with these traits.</p>
<h3>Tenet 3:&nbsp;The brain executes innate, domain-specific, functionally isolable cognitive programs that generate particular behaviors in response to particular external or internal informational inputs. Most or even all of these programs evolved as a response to a particular adaptive information processing problem.</h3>
<p>It should be noted that it is not claimed that all cognitive programs generate behavior deterministically based on the current perceptual input. Rather, some of these programs exhibit what is commonly called <em>experience-dependent plasticity</em>: They are able to learn based on the input they receive throughout the organism’s development (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987, p. 284). For example, the language program learns to acquire the language of a person’s surrounding community. The programs, therefore, did not evolve to produce a certain kind of behavior, but they evolved to produce a mapping from current inputs and the sequence of inputs they received throughout development to behaviors. Different programs have different degrees of experience-dependent plasticity, depending on the fitness advantage that plasticity would provide over genetic determinism in the program’s adaptive domain.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, programs are <em>experience-expectant</em>: They evolved to be able to develop only if they receive certain informational inputs at critical periods throughout development (Tooby and Cosmides, 2005, p. 34-35). This entails that a program’s innateness does not mean that it is present at birth – much like teeth are innate but not present at birth. Rather, a cognitive program can develop at any point in an organism’s life, depending on whether it is relevant at that point in life and whether the developmentally relevant informational inputs have been received. Tooby and Cosmides (2005, p. 35) stress that this developmentally relevant information consists not only of contingencies in physical laws and the behavior of other organisms, but also of the physical and cultural environment. The latter comprise a second inheritance system that co-evolves with the genes, and changes in these environments can lead to significant alterations in the operation of the cognitive programs, or even a failure of certain cognitive programs to develop.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that it is not claimed that the cognitive programs can&nbsp;only generate behavior according to their original adaptive function. For example, the language program, which arose as an adaptation for spoken language, can learn to acquire reading and writing (Tooby and Cosmides, 2005, p. 26). The ability to learn reading and writing is not an adaptation but a by-product of the adaptation for spoken language.</p>
<p>However, it is claimed that the …</p></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

    <div>
        
<p>At some point, I got tired of my old static site generator setup for my blogs and other pages. It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him "hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in".</p>
<p>I wanted something with a <em>little</em> more dynamism. </p>
<p>So that was the project: a small scope blog, where a few, already <em>trusted</em> users can make, edit, and post new pages in markdown (with a nice markdown editor courtesy of <a href="https://simplemde.com/">SimpleMDE</a>). Additionally, I want a built in jank verison of imgur so I can satisfy my need to be self sufficient without going crazy.</p>
<p>So while I could whip something up in an afternoon with Django, I could also experiment with other languages. The project is simple enough that I can't imagine being too limited by any language's ecosystem. And I've been itching to write something substansive in Rust...</p>
<h3>Which framework?</h3>
<p>The biggest framework is probably <code>actix-web</code>. But</p>
<ol>
<li>When I was scoping out my options months ago, actix-web's maintainer quit with a bunch of drama</li>
<li>At least from what I could tell reading the docs, it seems more suited to APIs rather than servers serving templated HTML</li>
<li>With the above, I wanted this to be a weekend project, not a weekly project, so the more batteries included the better</li>
<li>I really don't want to figure out which async library is considered better. And note that with each async library, comes its own ecosystem of libraries, which only work with that async library, so it's a pretty hard decision to reverse after you made it.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Rocket it is. </p>

<p>Something I didn't realize until I started scoping out this project is that on servers... the memory model is actually pretty simple! </p>
<p>Much of your state is just handled by your database. I <em>never</em> actually fought with the borrow checker. I never had to. For the most part, everything had exactly one owner, and exactly one lifetime: the function that's handling the request. </p>
<p>Rocket, too, has a surprising amount of "magic":</p>
<pre><code>#[get("/posts/&lt;slug&gt;/"]
pub fn post_view(slug: String) -&gt; Option&lt;Template&gt; {
    ...
		
    Some(Template::render("/posts/post", hashmap! { "post" =&gt; post}))
}
</code></pre>
<p>As opposed to Flask's</p>
<pre><code>@app.route("/posts/&lt;string:slug&gt;")
def post_view(slug):
    ...
		
    return render_template("posts/post.html", post=post)
</code></pre>
<p>Rust's macro system has really impressed me so far. Not only is there a shocking amount of "just works", but it's all statically typed and compiled.</p>
<p>The closest analogue to Rocket is flask + all the flask adjacent libraries (SQLAlchemy-flask, etc). Rocket, through the power of 3rd party integrations, comes with two template engines (handlebars, and Tera, which is basically Jinja2), database pooling support for quite a few ORMs/DB drivers, and more.</p>
<p>It's still at the point where you have to roll your own auth, though.</p>
<p>While I've heard comparisons to Django/Rails, it doesn't really seem like they're going that direction. Django/Rails purposefully put you, the developer, on the metaphorical rails, dictating best practices from everything from where the files go, to how you update your models and views. Rocket doesn't do that, and I'm not sure it should ever.</p>
<p>I also had, for the most part, the experience that "if it compiles, it works". Most of my runtime errors were in the templates, which incidentally is the only thing that's not statically typed. </p>
<p>I guess that's really what surprised me. For a lot of it, "it just works"! There's not a lot of boilerplate syntax, type inference keeps your functions clean, and I didn't write a <em>single</em> lifetime annotation at any point. My rust server really didn't look that different from my flask server, or my Django server, and honestly it looks cleaner than my Java server. All with no garbage collector or runtime.</p>

<p>Next, I'll talk about Diesel, which as far as I can see, is the most mature ORM available. While I do have my gripes, it's not really anything "objectively" bad. I suppose it's more on tradeoffs, and Diesel chooses to go light on the magic. </p>
<p>For one, it's annoying to make two structs for each table. You need one to represent the table, and one to insert with (with any autogenerated columns like the primary key removed). For instance, I have</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Identifiable, Queryable, Associations, PartialEq, Debug, Serialize)]
#[belongs_to(BlogPosts, foreign_key="post_id")]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct Tag {
    id: i32,
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "tags"]
pub struct InsertTag {
    tag_name: String,
    post_id: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, while in some ORMs you write your table models, and the ORM generates your SQL migrations, in Diesel, you write your SQL migrations by hand, and the ORM generates a <code>schema.rs</code> file that contains the mappings. I actually don't mind that one too much.</p>
<p>Diesel also only supports parent-child relationships, and you have to be quite explicit. There's no magic field on your parent, that magically gives you a list of its children. No, you just have to write the query and call it. In some sense it's more like using a slightly fancier query builder.</p>
<p>Dipping down from that level of magic, it's not really a <em>bad</em> thing per se. By being explicit, you prevent users from believing too much in that magic, and shooting themselves in the foot, like N+1 selects. </p>
<p>But I'm not going to say it didn't slow me down quite a bit, either. And to be honest, writing joins was a humongous pain in the ass. Maybe that's how it should be, but maybe that also caused a generation of NoSQL databases. 🤷</p>

<p>Here's how you upload an image in flask</p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/images/upload')
def upload_file():
	files = request.files['file']
	if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the "simpler" example, while using a <em>third party library in addition</em> from abonader</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/abonander/multipart/blob/master/examples/rocket.rs"><strong>See the whole thing here</strong></a></p>
<pre><code>#[post("/upload", data = "&lt;data&gt;")]
// signature requires the request to have a `Content-Type`
fn multipart_upload(cont_type: &amp;ContentType, data: Data) -&gt; Result&lt;Stream&lt;Cursor&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt;&gt;, Custom&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    // this and the next check can be implemented as a request guard but it seems like just
    // more boilerplate than necessary
    if !cont_type.is_form_data() {
        return Err(Custom(
            Status::BadRequest,
            "Content-Type not multipart/form-data".into()
        ));
    }

    let (_, boundary) = cont_type.params().find(|&amp;(k, _)| k == "boundary").ok_or_else(
            || Custom(
                Status::BadRequest,
                "`Content-Type: multipart/form-data` boundary param not provided".into()
            )
        )?;

    match process_upload(boundary, data) {
        Ok(resp) =&gt; Ok(Stream::from(Cursor::new(resp))),
        Err(err) =&gt; Err(Custom(Status::InternalServerError, err.to_string()))
    }
}

fn process_upload(boundary: &amp;str, data: Data) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    let mut out = Vec::new();

    // saves all fields, any field longer than 10kB goes to a temporary directory
    // Entries could implement FromData though that would give zero control over
    // how the files are saved; Multipart would be a good impl candidate though
    match Multipart::with_body(data.open(), boundary).save().temp() {
        Full(entries) =&gt; process_entries(entries, &amp;mut out)?,
        Partial(partial, reason) =&gt; {
            writeln!(out, "Request partially processed: {:?}", reason)?;
            if let Some(field) = partial.partial {
                writeln!(out, "Stopped on field: {:?}", field.source.headers)?;
            }

            process_entries(partial.entries, &amp;mut out)?
        },
        Error(e) =&gt; return Err(e),
    }

    Ok(out)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to be fair, Rocket is in version 0.4.5. From <a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/106"><strong>this github issue</strong></a>, multipart form support is coming in 0.5.0. But it doesn't change the fact that right now, the current libraries are somewhat immature still. They lack some of the edge features, especially for more traditional web servers that serve templated HTML, as opposed to pure API servers, or an SPA. </p>
<hr>
<p>Rust's errors are quite good, usually. But that's before you get into, well, libraries that try to do a bit more. I ran into some... interesting error messages, mostly from macros in Rocket and Diesel. Take a look at this one, for instance.</p>
<pre><code>the trait bound `(i32, std::string::String, std::string::String, std::string::String, i32, i32, std::string::String, i32, i32): diesel::Queryable&lt;diesel::sql_types::Nullable&lt;(diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Text, diesel::sql_types::Integer, diesel::sql_types::Integer)&gt;, diesel::sqlite::Sqlite&gt;` is not satisfied

<p><strong>1/</strong> The first level related to the metaphysical and spiritual domain.</p>



<p>It says that Brahman is all that exists and our material world (Maya) comes from ignorance.</p>



<p>The Brahman is not a God. It is beyond any quality – it isn’t intelligent, good or bad. It just is.</p>



<p><strong>2/</strong> It also suggests that if we strip away all ignorance, we will discover that the self – the atman – is one and the same thing as the Brahman.</p>



<p>At its core, this level denies the duality of subject and object and says they both are the same.</p>



<p><strong>3/</strong> The second level has more religious connotations because, like all religions, its purpose is the stabilization of society.</p>



<p>The concept of Karma and Dharma ensures that society has net positive interactions. And the rituals and idol worship ensures everyone knows who is in the camp.</p>



<p><strong>4/</strong> This level ensures an ethical code exists and that it’s clear who all share that same ethical code.</p>



<p>The symbols – the idols, the chants, the rituals – take a spiritual dimension on their own, but these are subservient to the belief in one Brahman – the essence of the world.</p>



<p><strong>5/</strong> The third level is psychological – to give guidance to an individual on how to live his/her life.</p>



<p>The suggestion in <a href="https://invertedpassion.com/what-gita-teaches-us-and-what-it-doesnt/">Gita</a> that one must do work without an expectation of reward is towards minimizing psychological anguish.</p>



<p><strong>6/</strong> To reiterate, the three levels of Hindu philosophy are:</p>



<ul><li>METAPHYSICAL: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81v%C4%81kyas">Tat tvam asi.</a> You’re it [it = Brahman]</li><li>SOCIETAL: Rebirth, Karma, Dharma, and Rituals</li><li>PSYCHOLOGICAL: Expect no reward</li></ul>



<p><strong>7/</strong> Of course, everyone has their interpretation. Unlike Judeo-Christian religions, there are no definitive books on Hindusim.</p>



<p>Rather than a bug, I think it’s a feature.</p>



<p>It ceases to be a philosophy if you can’t interpret it on your own.</p>



<p><strong>8/</strong> There are some beautiful ideas in Hinduism, though I’m not sure I agree with all of them.</p>



<p>If you have your favorite ideas, let me know. I love diving deep into Indian philosophy.</p>



<p><em>This essay is a lightly-edited version of a <a href="https://twitter.com/paraschopra/status/1104658952061681665">Twitter thread I posted</a>.</em></p>

<p>I ported a C library to rust last week, and it went pretty smoothly. This is
the story, and <a href="https://github.com/jneem/nnnoiseless">here</a> is the repo.</p>

<p>The library in question is <a href="https://github.com/xiph/rnnoise">RNNoise</a>, a
library for removing noise from audio. It works well, it runs fast, and best of
all it has no knobs that you need to tune. There’s even a <a href="https://github.com/RustAudio/rnnoise-c">rust
binding</a>.</p>

<p>So why bother porting it?
Well, I need to patch it so that it would compile with MSVC, but my PR went
unnoticed for a month. I thought about maintaining my own fork, but it’s been
more than 10 years since I last wrote anything in C or C++.
And that’s how I ended up porting RNNoise to rust. It probably wasn’t the most
efficient use of my time, but I had fun and learned something.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of information out there about porting C to rust, but the most
useful resource for me was the fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/carols10cents/rust-out-your-c-talk">talk</a> by Carol (Nichols
|| Goulding). It lays out a simple process for porting one function
at a time: first, you set up the cargo to compile as a static library and you
set up the C build system to link that static library into the C library
(see the slides for the relevant Makefile and Cargo.toml snippets).
Then you can port one function at time: the C code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span><span>void</span> <span>__celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>-</span><span>void</span> <span>_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>opus_val16</span> <span>*</span><span>_lpc</span><span>,</span> <span>const</span> <span>opus_val32</span> <span>*</span><span>ac</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>/* C body of _celt_lpc */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the rust code goes like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>+</span><span>#[no_mangle]</span>
<span>+</span><span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>_</span><span>celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> <span>p</span><span>:</span> <span>c_int</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>+</span>        <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc_slice</span><span>,</span> <span>ac_slice</span><span>);</span>
<span>+</span>    <span>}</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
<span>+</span>
<span>+</span><span>fn</span> <span>rs_celt_lpc</span><span>(</span><span>lpc</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ac</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
<span>+</span><span>// rust body of celt_lpc</span>
<span>+</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you’ve watched the talk (which you should), you might notice that this is a
tiny bit different from what they recommend: I’ve renamed the original C
function instead of deleting it. I found that this helped me narrow down porting
mistakes, because it made it easy to switch back and forth between the C and
rust implementations.</p>



<p>Most of the porting process was mechanical and easy. One of the less fun parts was
porting code involving C structs. RNNoise has structs that (when ported to
rust) look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[repr(C)]</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// Various buffers, whose sizes are determined by some subfields of `model`.</span>
    <span>vad_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>noise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>denoise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An idomatic rust version might look something like</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>RnnState</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>model</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>'static</span> <span>RnnModel</span><span>,</span>
    <span>vad_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>noise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>denoise_gru_state</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>f32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>but this isn’t layout-compatible with the original C version, and so I need to
stick with the original struct for as long as <code>RnnState</code> is being accessed by
both C and rust code. This increases the amount of <code>unsafe</code> sprinkled around
the rust code, and it was also the source of an annoying bug of the sort that I
thought I had left behind by moving to rust.</p>



<p>At some point during the porting process, my tests started failing in release mode,
but not in debug mode. Most likely some undefined behavior triggered by my amateurish
attempts at unsafe code, but I couldn’t quickly spot the problem and the prospect of
a more careful round of debugging didn’t spark a whole lot of joy. So I did something
that I never would have dared to do in my C/C++ days: I ignored the problem and kept
porting; after all, the tests were still working in debug mode. And sure enough,
a few more ported functions later and <code>rustc</code> found the problem for me: in a function
taking a <code>&amp;RnnState</code> parameter, I was modifying data in the <code>vad_gru_state</code> buffer.
Since I was using unsafe code, <code>rustc</code> didn’t complain at first. But once I ported
the <code>RnnState</code> struct to safe and idiomatic rust, the compiler flagged the problem
immediately.</p>



<p>After getting everything to 100% safe (if not particulary idiomatic) rust, it was time
to check whether performance had suffered.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark.svg" alt="initial benchmark"></p>

<p>Yes, apparently, by about 50%. The most obvious culprit was bounds checking: there was
a lot of indexing in the C code, and some of it wasn’t trivial to convert to a more
rust-friendly, iterator-based version. First priority was the neural network evaluation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 114.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span> <span>// At most 96.</span>

<span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>n</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.bias</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span><span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>j</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>m</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>output</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.input_weights</span><span>[</span><span>j</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>as</span> <span>f32</span> <span>*</span> <span>input</span><span>[</span><span>j</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can already see you shaking your head. I’m doing naive matrix-vector multiplication
with a 100x100ish matrix in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order">column-major format</a>?
Not only is this costing me bounds checks, it’s terrible for memory locality.
Swapping the weights storage from column- to row-major order only made things
about 1.5% faster, but more importantly it made the whole thing iterator-friendly.
Converting to zips and sums bought another 15%, leaving me only about 25-30% slower
than the C code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>n</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For my next optimization opportunity, I moved on to the function
that
computes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation">cross-correlations</a>.
The un-optimized version of this function looks like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>pitch_xcorr</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>],</span> <span>xcorr</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>[</span><span>f32</span><span>])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>xcorr</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>xcorr</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>xs</span><span>.iter</span><span>()</span><span>.zip</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ys</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>..</span><span>])</span><span>.map</span><span>(|(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>y</span><span>)|</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span><span>.sum</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but the C code contained a massive, manually-unrolled version. I’d skipped
it while porting, but maybe I’d gain something from porting it over. Here’s
an abbreviated version of the optimized function, assuming that all
lengths are a multiple of 4 (the real code also handles the case that they aren’t).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>xcorr</span><span>.len</span><span>())</span><span>.step_by</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Basically, both inner and outer loops have been unrolled four times, and I’ve
exploited the inner loop’s unrolling to optimize the memory access pattern.
Thanks to the amazing <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm"><code>cargo asm</code></a>, I
can happily report that there’s no bounds-checking in the inner loop and that
all the arithmetic has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">auto-vectorized</a>
to work four <code>f32</code>s at a time. (Maybe it would get even faster if I unrolled 8 times and
compiled with AVX enabled; I haven’t tried that yet.)</p>

<p>This change more than doubled the speed of <code>pitch_xcorr</code>, and gained me about 10% overall.
More importantly, it showed me how to coerce the compiler into auto-vectorizing something
that it hadn’t auto-vectorized before. I went back to the neural network code and
replaced things like</p>

<p>for another 20% improvement.</p>

<p>Current score: the rust version (still 100% safe) is about 15% faster, and there’s probably plenty more
still on the table.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/ported_benchmark_after.svg" alt="final benchmark"></p>

<p>The performance lesson I learned from this is that bounds checking can be expensive in numerical code
and iterator-style code can help a bit, but if you really want faster numerical code then you need
to write in a style that the auto-vectorizer likes. (Or you could use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/arch/index.html">SIMD intrinsics</a>
directly, but that’s another story.)</p>



<p>Like I wrote above, it’s been a while since I did any C/C++, and because of that I’ve started to take tools
like cargo for granted. This little porting project brought back some memories, mostly because about half of the
code in RNNoise was actually “vendored” from <a href="https://gitlab.xiph.org/xiph/opus">opus</a>. I put “vendored”
in quotes because I usually think of vendoring as involving a subdirectory (maybe even a git submodule if
I’m lucky) with its own build artifacts. That’s not what’s going on here, though; I’m just talking about files
that were copied from the source directory of one project to the source directory of another, complete with
never-used functions and never-def’ed ifdefs. The thing is, though, that I understand exactly why they did it:
it’s by far the easiest way to share code between C projects. So I just want to finish by saying a big “thank you”
to <code>cargo</code> and <code>crates.io</code> for making me not have to deal with C dependency management any more.</p>

    <p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/cover.jpg"></p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking and reading a lot about consciousness and how the human mind works. A question that emerges all the time is whether machines can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">emulate human thought</a>. An even more interesting one is whether consciousness (a subjective experience) can arise from a machine, but I’ll leave that discussion for a future post (I’ll need ~20 more years to think about that before I can write about it).</p>

<p>So, how far are we from _behaviorally _imitating a human? Truth is, we achieved a lot in the past 5 years (see <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">AlphaGo</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">OpenGPT-2</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">OpenAI Jukebox</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot">Tesla Autopilot</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">Alphastar</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions/">OpenAI Dota2 Team</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/">OpenAI API</a>), but we’re still quite not there. My hunch is that we still can learn a lot from biology’s state of the art. I’ve done some research on differences in how human brains work and how we emulate them using deep neural networks, and what follows is a summary of what I’ve found (and some new ideas).</p>

<figure>

<h2 id="morphology">Morphology</h2>

<p>The most surprising difference between artificial and human brains is how <em>sequential</em> our artificial neural networks (ANN) are, compared to the richly interconnected biological counterparts.</p>

<p>I’m always amazed by the sheer amount of layers that are stacked on top of each other <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">in the latest deep learning models</a>. The largest GPT-3 model (with 175B parameters) uses 96 attention layers, each with 96x 128-dimension heads. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">Their paper</a> shows that language model performance scales as a power-law with model size.</p>

<p>However, this assumes the size of the network can only increase by adding more layers, making it “deeper”. Using layers enables for great performance in training via <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/">backpropagation/ADAM</a>, but I think the current mostly-sequential approach to scaling ANNs is limiting. Some ideas:</p>

<h3 id="wide-vs-deep-neural-networks">Wide (vs. Deep) Neural Networks</h3>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image8.png">
<img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image3.png"></p>

<p>A promising approach is exploring other kinds of architectures, where the concept of “layer” is forgotten, and networks are built more freely (with connections being modelled at the neuron level, and allowing for loops and more complex topologies). This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine">has been somewhat explored in the past</a>, but I haven’t seen recent studies where today’s computing power is thrown at such architectures. Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies">Ken Stanley’s NEAT (2002)</a> and derivatives are a very promising way of finding new topologies via evolution.</p>

<h3 id="neural-grids">Neural Grids</h3>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image6.png"></p>

<p>Another idea worth exploring: grid-like structures where each cell communicates only with its neighbors. In this neural net model, potential is not only passed forward, but also “upward” and “downward”, or even diagonally. This would emulate more closely, I think, a real brain’s connectivity. A related approach is <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl.2009.15.2.15202">Hypercube-based NEAT (2009)</a>, which allows exploiting the task’s geometry by mapping its regularities onto the topology of the network.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-cortical-columns">Artificial Cortical Columns</h3>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image9.png">
<img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image5.png"></p>

<p>Human’s brain neocortex seems to have a surprisingly self-repeating pattern, called <a href="https://youtu.be/x2mYTaJPVnc?t=98">cortical columns</a>. Each column can be thought of as a reusable ~110 neuron module that appears (with variations) across neocortex areas associated with such different functions as vision, motor control, auditory perception, decision-making, planning, etc. <a href="https://numenta.com/neuroscience-research/cortical-columns/">Studying these structures</a> and applying similar concepts/topologies to ANNs seems like a promising approach. Cortical columns provide amazingly generic hierarchical information processing capabilities, feedback mechanisms, and layered communication with other parts of the brain.</p>

<h3 id="generative-architectures-arising-from-growth">Generative architectures arising from growth</h3>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image10.png"></p>

<p>What if neural net architecture is determined by a generative / procedural algorithm on runtime, instead of being defined by researchers? The seed could be random or evolved through genetic algorithms too. I think that somehow mimicking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtLyik7oAxc&amp;list=PLTF9h-T1TcJjUxgs0dqyDCaS-glauXcsL&amp;index=4">neurulation of human embryos</a> via simple models could lead to finding better-performing architectures. Human brains grow into existence, and maybe that matters for high-level intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<h3 id="evolve-first-learn-later">Evolve first, Learn later.</h3>

<p>Some techniques use <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-018-0006-z">neuroevolution used to automate network design</a> or <a href="https://blog.otoro.net/2017/11/12/evolving-stable-strategies/">evolutionary strategies finding network weights instead of gradient descent</a>. It’d be interesting to see hybrid approaches where network structure is evolved and <em>later</em> allowed to learn in an environment (like humans!). Additionally, as I learnt from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11786-6">this fascinating paper by Tony Zador</a> (2019), “A large component of an animal’s behavioral repertoire is not the result of supervised or unsupervised learning, but rather of behavior programs already present at birth”. Learning is actually one of such behaviors, so… shouldn’t researchers be focusing more on optimizing the lower-level mechanism of evolution instead of polishing our “hand-crafted” learning algorithms and architectures?</p>

<p>On a similar ‘meta-learning’ vein, the comically named <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6461-learning-to-learn-by-gradient-descent-by-gradient-descent.pdf">Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent</a> (2016) paper shows that you can train a network to optimize other networks, and they perform better than hand-crafted learning algorithms like <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/adam-latest-trends-in-deep-learning-optimization-6be9a291375c">ADAM</a> and <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-rmsprop-faster-neural-network-learning-62e116fcf29a">RMSProp</a>.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-vs-discrete-neuron-firing">Continuous (vs. discrete) neuron firing</h3>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image4.png"></p>

<p>Instead of processing inputs in discrete events, our networks could ‘stare’ at inputs for a couple iterations, and neurons can ‘store-up’ potential until they fire. This aims to mimic how we humans can look at something we don’t understand, but after a couple of seconds we “get it”. This could also enable the emergence of “memories” in the form of stored potential, too, analogous to the hidden state vector of LSTMs. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lddzHEtu934">Gabriel Kreiman’s related work (2018)</a> on improving object detection in occluded or distorted conditions. Regardless of the specific implementations mentioned above, biological brains clearly have a temporal dimension (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFrG7KdjUOs&amp;list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&amp;index=32">neurons in the visual motion MT area respond to direction of motion</a>), which we need to understand better to inform construction of artificial ones. Another interesting time-related property of biological brains is <a href="https://youtu.be/fki7AmLma_I?t=450">the difference between tonic vs bursting modes of neuron firing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="connecting-functional-building-blocks">Connecting functional building blocks</h3>

<p>Animal brains are surprisingly pre-wired and connected since birth, and it’s still not clear in general which behaviors are learned through experience and which are innate. Moreover, a big field of study in neuroscience is understanding how the human brain is wired, mostly via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography">diffusion tractography</a>, and in some cases <a href="https://youtu.be/KFfaBoDANNI?t=134">it’s been shown that connectivity can predict function</a>. However, the fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bvblav-BQk&amp;list=PLyGKBDfnk-iAQx4Kw9JeVqspbg77sfAK0&amp;index=65">‘rewired ferrets’ experiments</a> showed that training input also conditions function strongly (newborn ferrets with auditory cortex rewired to receive visual input still learn to see). This implies that animal brains have a very optimized initial configuration, but also the flexibility to adapt to structural damages or drastical environmental condition changes.</p>

<p>Many well-performing techniques simply stack two architectures that work for two separate domains (eg: CNN visual embedder and LSTM language model) and re-train them for a new combined task (eg: image captioning).</p>

<p><img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image7.png">
<img src="https://maraoz.com/img/brains-vs-anns/image2.png"></p>

<p>I suggest trying to mimic what we know today of how the human brain is wired (from <a href="http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/">the Human Connectome Project</a>, for example), and plugging in some state-of-the-art modules for vision, language, and audio-processing.</p>

<h3 id="slow-and-data-light-learning">Slow and Data-Light Learning</h3>

<p>Humans seem to learn slowly (in real time, it takes a human ~2 years to learn a language at a basic level, and ~18 years to learn advanced level language usage or complex language tasks like translation) but with few examples. Machines, on the other hand, learn very fast (in the order of weeks to achieve state of the art in some tasks) but are very data-hungry. Some techniques require less training data but might take longer to train, like <a href="https://medium.com/@SmartLabAI/a-brief-overview-of-imitation-learning-8a8a75c44a9c">Imitation Learning</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/competitive-self-play/">Competitive Self-Play</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11212">Symbolic Pregressions (2020)</a> and could be key to getting closer to human intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="intermixing-learning-techniques">Intermixing Learning Techniques</h3>

<p>A combination of learning strategies could be necessary for human-level intelligence, as Yann LeCun suggests with his cake analogy: “If intelligence is a cake, the bulk of the cake is <a href="https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/10624">self-supervised learning</a>, the icing on the cake is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a>, and the cherry on the cake is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.”</p>

<p>Humans train by learning from others (supervised learning) <em>and</em> experimenting on our own (unsupervised/self-supervised learning). For example, a chess student first talks to a teacher, then plays some games. They wouldn’t go to a chess tournament after just talking to a teacher or playing games alone. Can we combine/emulate these kinds of training efficiently in ML too?</p>

<h2 id="final-words--further-studying">Final words &amp; further studying</h2>

<p>What do you think of these approaches? Have you actually seen any of these used in the wild (with success or otherwise)? Which do you think may have merits? Let me know if you do some experiments to try them out.</p>

<video src="https://www.naut.ca/videos/smash60fps.mp4" poster="https://www.naut.ca/videos/smash60fps.jpg" preload="none" controls="" playsinline=""></video>

<p>Above is a sample of 60fps Super Smash Bros Ultimate gameplay (I'm a Jigglypuff main) recorded with the $15 HDMI Capture Card and OBS. This card has been making the rounds last month on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ascii211/status/1268631069051453448">Twitter</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daS5RHVAl2U">YouTube</a>, mainly due to its low, low price of $15 USD. I've decided to get one myself and take a look. The chipset contained in the card is the MacroSilicon MS2109. Here is the review, as well as a discussion of the potential use-cases.</p>
<h3 id="operatingsystem">Operating System</h3>
<p>This card, surprisingly enough, works on Windows, macOS and Linux! This is because it implements the UVC standard, a USB device that is OS agnostic. Getting it working on Linux is a bit of a hassle, but you can find out how <a href="https://bigl.es/friday-fun-10-hdmi-to-usb-capture/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed that using the capture card on Linux or macOS resulted in significantly more framedrops and synchronization issues, when compared to Windows (although the macOS issues might be due to weak CPU). If you are okay with slightly choppy or stuttery recordings, then feel free to use the card on macOS or Linux. The Windows UVC driver captures more frames, and has the most options of the three. Most of the guide will be focusing on the Windows driver. The controls that are listed in OBS for each operating system are shown below.<br>
<img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-7.13.22-PM.jpg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-7.13.22-PM"></p>
<h3 id="yuy2vsmjpeg">YUY2 vs MJPEG</h3>
<p>Windows and Linux both support the YUY2 and MJPEG video format, while macOS only supports MJPEG. YUY2 in this context refers to an almost uncompressed form of data (except for colour information), while MJPEG uses lossy JPEG compression on every frame. This means that YUY2 provides a cleaner image with no compression artifacts, while MJPEG has a noisier and blockier image. Compare the two capture formats below:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-12.33.23-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-12.33.23-AM"></p>
<p>As you can see MJPEG has degraded the image data, which is necessary to compress each frame to a small size. Only MJPEG can achieve high framerates with this card because the interface it uses, USB 2.0, caps out around 50 MB/s. For reference, a YUY2 1280x720 60fps signal would exceed 100 MB/s. If you want a card that supports a 60fps YUY2 signal, you can expect to pay in the range of hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>Both the YUY2 and MJPEG video formats from this card use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>, a data saving trick that takes advantage of the human eye's decreased colour resolution. It essentially deletes colour data, while keeping brightness data intact. I tested both formats, and they are outputting a 4:2:2 signal (50% of the colour data is deleted). You can see that the horizontal axis changes colour at 2 pixel boundaries, while the vertical axis changes at 1 pixel boundaries.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-12.32.56-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-12.32.56-AM"></p>
<h3 id="resolutionandframerate">Resolution and Framerate</h3>
<p>A wide variety of resolutions and framerates are supported on the input side of the device. It even supports input at 4K 60fps! From the NVIDIA Control Panel, here is an abridged list of the resolutions and framerates supported on the <strong>input side</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>4K    60,59,50,30,29,25,24,23Hz
1080p 60,59,50Hz
720p  60,59,50Hz
576p  50Hz
480p  60,59Hz
PC    60Hz
</code></pre>
<p>To clarify, just because this card can accept or capture a 4K signal, does not mean that it can send the full signal to your computer. This card contains a scaler, which scales the image down (or up, depending on the input) in resolution before it is sent. With reference to the OBS properties window, here is an abridged list of the resolutions and max framerates as seen by my Windows PC:</p>
<pre><code>1920x1080 MJPEG:30fps, YUY2:5fps
1600x1200 MJPEG:30fps, YUY2:5fps
1360x768  MJPEG:30fps, YUY2:?
1280x960  MJPEG:50fps, YUY2:?
1280x720  MJPEG:60fps, YUY2:10fps
1024x768  MJPEG:60fps, YUY2:10fps
800x600   MJPEG:60fps, YUY2:20fps
720x480   MJPEG:60fps, YUY2:30fps
</code></pre>
<p>Each resolution dictates a maximum framerate for the device, limited by the bandwidth of the USB interface. To summarize, this card supports an output of 1920x1080 30fps and 1280x720 60fps with the MJPEG format.</p>
<h3 id="resolutionandframeratecaveats">Resolution and Framerate Caveats</h3>
<p>First I'll talk about framerate. I noticed that recording or streaming from the card at 60fps tends to repeat or skip a frame every few seconds, even with buffering on. Make sure to keep buffering on, otherwise you will lose frames at 30fps as well. I have confirmed this by recording videos in OBS and analyzing them frame by frame.</p>
<p>If you want virtually perfect frame capture at both 720p and 1080p, you should use 30fps with buffering!</p>
<p>Also, you may notice that there are 29.97fps and 59.94fps options in OBS. Only use these if you are absolutely sure that your device needs these values. You will likely run into desynchronization issues if you accidentally use these framerates.</p>
<p>Next, when I tested the 1920x1080 capture, I was shocked by how blurry it was. It turns out that this card doesn't actually do true 1080p! Here's a screenshot of Wikipedia, compared to what was captured at 1920x1080.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-2.48.49-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-2.48.49-AM"></p>
<p>It looks like the card is capturing the vertical resolution fine, but the horizontal resolution is a soft mess. I tried out 1280x720, and everything looked crisp and fine, leading me to suspect that the card was capturing internally at a resolution of 1280 columns. I ended up using display calibration images from <a href="http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/sharpness.php">Lagom LCD</a> to see how the pixels in the capture were behaving. Right click the following image and choose Open/View Image for a better view.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-3.05.56-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-3.05.56-AM"></p>
<p>Using the reference on the left, we can see that 1280x720 has correct vertical and horizontal resolution. 1360x768 and 1920x1080 also have correct vertical resolution, but the columns are turning grey. This is because adjacent white and black pixels from the high input resolution are merged into a lower resolution, i.e. from 1920 columns into 1280 columns. If you also noticed that pixel columns are brighter than the rows, I will be talking about that in the next section.</p>
<p>As a quick aside, everything above was for progressive video input. Interestingly, this card also supports an input of 1080i/interlaced video, which I tested with macOS and my Canon 600D camera. Using 1080i was absolutely horrible for desktop recording, since the card uses a brainless deinterlacing algorithm that halves the vertical resolution to 540. Yes, it actually looks that bad. As for my camera, it was decent, but the edges were kind of funny.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.01.51-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.01.51-AM"></p>
<h3 id="imageaccuracycaveats">Image Accuracy Caveats</h3>
<p>This card needs "Color Range" set to "Full" in the OBS Capture Card Properties. Any devices that are connected to the card input need to have their HDMI "Range" set to "Limited". This is the only correct combination, otherwise highlights and shadows in the video are clipped. The following shows the effects of the device range options.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.53.19-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.53.19-PM"></p>
<p>As you might have noticed from the previous section, the 1280x720 capture is brightening the columns. This indicates that the card is performing image sharpening only in the horizontal direction. You can find evidence of this type of sharpening wherever there are sharp edges:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.21.58-AM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.21.58-AM"></p>
<p>This is a bad feature, as all image sharpening should be done after the capture. Fortunately, there is a way to get around this for 1280x720 content. Simply set your device to 1280x720, and then capture at 1920x1080. The image loses some clarity in brightness changes, due to the unnecessary resize, but all the sharpening has disappeared! Furthermore, since we are receiving 1920x1080 data, we now have better colour resolution as well, close to 4:3:3 chroma subsampling.</p>
<p>The 1920x1080 MJPEG capture also has significantly less compression artifacts than the 1280x720 MJPEG capture, which is probably due to different framerate support. From the image below, you can see that the 1080p capture is the winner all around (sharpening was applied post-capture for comparison with 720p).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.25.44-PM.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-07-09-at-5.25.44-PM"></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are capturing slower gameplay, i.e. only 30fps, set your device to 1920x1080 and then capture at 1920x1080. This provides the most brightness and colour resolution at 30fps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have 1280x720 content, capture at 1920x1080. This will result in the least amount of sharpening and MJPEG artifacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are capturing a desktop screen or anything with thin lines and pixels, then set your device to 1280x720 and then capture at 1280x720.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need 60fps content, i.e. for gaming, then set your device to 1920x1080 and then capture at 1280x720. This disables sharpening. The sample at the beginning of the article was encoded with "x264" at the "veryfast" setting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning: if you see a listing for a $20 USD capture card that claims to support USB 3.0 and 1080p 60fps, it's a scam. I've already bought two of them from Amazon and eBay, and had to return both because they turned out to be a repackaging of the product I just reviewed!</p>

                    <p>The short answer is yes. Let me explain.</p><p>I’ve been working with developers and designers my entire life. </p><p>I’ve built a couple of products, worked at a young startup, and I’m now at Zepel helping development teams build better software.</p><p>I’ve spoken to 1000+ development teams while at Zepel alone. <strong>And it's evident that the way we build products is broken.</strong></p><p>There’s so much disconnect between how you and I talk about building products and how our teams actually build them.</p><p>For all the talk of scrum and agile and getting feedback quickly, there’s so much that’s broken in how we act on the feedback and build the feature.</p><p>Teams spend so much time and effort getting a deeper understanding of customers’ needs. And yet distil everything down to a simple two-line ticket and a couple of lines of markdown description.</p><p>This is hurting your developers. And it’s hurting your business.</p><blockquote>Nothing is more frustrating than having to understand what an entire feature should or shouldn’t do from a two-line ticket filled with ten bullet points of acceptance criteria.</blockquote><p><em>*Here are five prioritized tickets for the upcoming sprint. We have to ship them on time!*</em></p><p>On the other hand, you have teams who are able to build top quality software. They’re the ones who can concentrate on the fine implementation details without losing focus on the broader purpose of the feature as a whole.</p><p>Everyone wants to get to that level. But instead, teams do the exact opposite.</p><p><strong>Teams think in issues and tickets, instead of the feature as a system.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="development-teams-are-not-ticket-movers-">Development teams are not ticket movers!</h2><p>Today, everything is about moving a ticket from “Todo” to “Done” as quick as possible. And watching <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/reports/burndown/">burndown charts</a>. And customizing the tool to the extent that the developer only views a single ticket.</p><p><em>*“What’s the velocity of our team?” is simply another way of asking how quickly can my team move an issue from “Todo” to “Done”.*</em></p><p>Pieces of that stuff are important for productivity and shipping on time.</p><p>But seriously, how is your team supposed to ship anything of value if you narrow their focus down to the smallest unit of work without any context of why it’s needed or how it connects to the whole feature?!</p><p>Overall, we’ve lost our way. Product development today has become more about checking items off a list as quickly as possible. </p><p><strong>It isn’t enough to write multiple user stories and share a Figma link if you want to ship quality software.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-software-product-teams-really-build-software-together">How software product teams really build software together</h2><p>Development teams build better software together when they have the complete context of what and why something is being built.</p><p>To achieve this, the foundational elements need to change.</p><p>And it starts with getting the right abstractions and naming conventions.</p><p><strong>The names you choose determine the perception and the quality of conversations you have. </strong>It’s why top developers spend time obsessing over names for classes, functions, and variables.</p><p>When you open up a VS Code and see a function called <code>send_signup_email</code>, you have a certain sense of what’s going to be inside and why that’s there.</p><p>The right abstractions can drive the team towards asking the right questions. And this is critical.</p><p><strong>Because when you’re tracking issues and tickets in isolation you have no choice but to measure only outputs.</strong></p><p>And teams today don’t want to measure only the outputs. They want to measure <em>outcomes</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-s-the-right-abstraction">What’s the right abstraction?</h2><p>The right abstraction is the one that prioritizes people over processes and tools. It's the one you and I use every day — it's Features.</p><p>When a squad creates a Feature and opens it, they’ll get to look at the entire feature as a unit. A <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/user-stories/">user story</a> inside it might describe a specific functionality. But the difference is, now each developer and designer know how it connects to the larger scheme of things for the entire feature.</p><blockquote>A feature forces inept managers to stop focussing on output-oriented questions like “how can we work faster”. <p>And shifts the focus on outcome-oriented questions like “why should we prioritize this feature” and “how does this feature tie to the OKR”.</p></blockquote><p>Miscellaneous tasks and incoming bugs can be tracked on a separate “List”, so high-priority bugs don't get missed out. And of course, when it comes to tracking them, they can all be tracked on a Sprint or on a Kanban Board.</p><p><strong>Feature as an abstraction is the right middle ground that lets you focus on the output as well as the outcome.</strong> It lets you zoom in and track what's happening today. It also allows you to zoom out and track a feature's progress across multiple disciplines. And it enables you to see how a feature moves from a feature request all the way to prioritization and development.</p><p>Simple issue trackers and project management tools have shoehorned teams into ticket-movers and have made them think in outputs. Metrics get feigned to show productivity. Thinking in outcomes has become ridiculously hard. And it's hurting businesses.</p><p>It's time for tools to reflect the reality of product development. It's time to remove the disconnect between development teams and what your customers really want. </p><p>It's time to stop thinking in isolated tickets and start thinking in features as a system!</p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what we have in store for you.

<p>A friend who has dyslexia described to me how she experiences reading. She <em>can</em> read, but it takes a lot of concentration, and the letters seems to “jump around”.</p>

<p>I remembered reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typoglycemia">typoglycemia</a>. Wouldn’t it be possible to do it interactively on a website with Javascript? Sure it would.</p>

<p>Feel like making a bookmarklet of this or something? <a href="https://github.com/geon/geon.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2016-03-03-dsxyliea.md">Fork it</a> on github.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyslexia is characterized by difficulty with learning to read fluently and with accurate comprehension despite normal intelligence. This includes difficulty with phonological awareness, phonological decoding, processing speed, orthographic coding, auditory short-term memory, language skills/verbal comprehension, and/or rapid naming.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Developmental reading disorder (DRD) is the most common learning disability. Dyslexia is the most recognized of reading disorders, however not all reading disorders are linked to dyslexia.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some see dyslexia as distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or poor or inadequate reading instruction. There are three proposed cognitive subtypes of dyslexia (auditory, visual and attentional), although individual cases of dyslexia are better explained by specific underlying neuropsychological deficits and co-occurring learning disabilities (e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, math disability, etc.). Although it is considered to be a receptive language-based learning disability in the research literature, dyslexia also affects one’s expressive language skills. Researchers at MIT found that people with dyslexia exhibited impaired voice-recognition abilities.</p>

    <p>How is your startup sharing knowledge with the rest of your team?
We’ve been using slack’s <code>#general</code> or <code>#random</code> channels to make announcements.
We regularly post documents and PPTs slack channels so that they can be used by other people. We have a channel called <code>#setup</code> to post all IT related information like how to login to VPN etc.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, these docs/notes become super hard to find. As good slack’s search is, you have to precisely know what you’re looking for. What we needed was a centralized knowledge base website - something like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a></p>

<p>But Confluence is clunky and slow, and not cheap ($5/user). We experimented with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It calls itself ‘a non-linear personal web notebook’. It’s an opensource software which you can host on your servers or AWS. But its non linear organization makes it super unintuitive and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="why-outline">Why Outline?</h2>

<p>Then, I found <a href="https://www.getoutline.com/">outline</a>! Outline is similar to TiddlyWiki in that it’s opensource and free to self-host. Its UI is a great balance between simplicity of plain text notes and feature creep of Confluence. Login to outline is through your slack - so one less password to remember (or save). You can create private notebooks for a team or just for yourself. You can create a public link of a note so that you can share it with people outside your team - say via email.</p>

<p><span>
    Outline has great UI
</span>
<img src="https://www.getoutline.com/images/screenshot.png"></p>

<p>Best part of all of this is that <em>data doesn’t leave your servers</em> if you self-host it!
We already have a server lying around on AWS to host our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index">python package server, pypi</a>. Since neither hosting pypi nor hosting outline are particularly intensive, we’ve hosted outline on this machine as <code>wiki.qure.ai</code>.</p>

<h2 id="install-outline">Install Outline</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, documentation for self-hosting outline is limited. There’s no robust docker-compose avaialable that you can use to directly create your server. In the rest of this post, I’ll show you how to host in your laptop or server. Before starting, make sure to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/chsasank/outline-wiki-docker-compose.git
cd outline-wiki-docker-compose
make install
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><span>
    make install
</span>
<img src="http://chsasank.github.io/assets/images/outline/make_install.png"></p>

<p>Follow the instructions. You’ll have to create a slack app.

<h2>
  Bringing GPU Acceleration to Inkscape, Week 2
</h2>
<p>Published the <time datetime="2020-06-12T20:02:31+02:00">2020-06-12</time></p>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>For the past two weeks since the beginning of this <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6070010742571008/#5859756641615872">GSoC
2020</a>
I have attempted to integrate <a href="https://github.com/servo/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>
into Inkscape, in order to draw (and refresh!) the canvas much faster by using
your GPU.</p>
<p>After some early attempts, where I created a C++ Inkscape extension opening
Pathfinder’s demo on the current SVG, and another extension which was basically
a copy of <a href="https://github.com/servo/pathfinder/blob/master/examples/c_canvas_glfw_minimal/c_canvas_glfw_minimal.c">Pathfinder’s C canvas
example</a>,
I’ve started to properly integrate it into Inkscape’s widgets.</p>
<p>That’s where the fun began, here is a small tour of the fun bugs I encountered:</p>
<h3 id="using-apitrace-on-wayland-can-be-interesting">Using <code>apitrace</code> On Wayland Can Be Interesting</h3>
<p><a href="https://apitrace.github.io/"><code>apitrace</code></a> is a very handy tool for debugging
OpenGL applications, it avoids having to understand the code’s structure, and
allows me to focus on the actual behaviour from the driver’s point of view.</p>
<pre><code><span>glXGetCurrentContext() not found: /usr/bin/../lib/apitrace/wrappers/egltrace.so: undefined symbol: glXGetCurrentContext
apitrace: warning: caught signal 6
</span></code></pre>
<p>I was a bit sad to see that a bug I found at the intersection of
<a href="https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace/issues/380">apitrace</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy/issues/68">libepoxy</a> back in 2015
reappeared now, this time caused by GDK doing the same.  In the end I rebuilt
both libepoxy and GTK+ with only their Wayland backend so they wouldn’t be
tempted to call GLX symbols.  This breaks Firefox and probably some other
software which link against their X11 symbols, but on my build/testing machine
it’s fine.</p>
<p>Speaking of running a (soon-to-be) OpenGL program on a remote machine,
<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mstoeckl/waypipe">waypipe</a> from last year’s
GSoC is extremely useful, it feels almost instantaneous on my 900&nbsp;KiB/s down
80&nbsp;KiB/s up ADSL connection.  For comparison, I also tried X11 forwarding over
ssh which only shows Inkscape’s window after 1:05, and also mounting the build
directory over sshfs where it takes 1:20 to do the same, and 6:40 (!) to
generate a stack trace in case of a panic.  I probably should have figured that
out during the community bonding period, but I didn’t think of it.</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-doesn-t-like-to-draw-into-gtk-glarea-very-much">Pathfinder Doesn’t Like To Draw Into <code>Gtk::GLArea</code> Very Much</h3>
<p>I spent quite a few days trying to get Pathfinder to draw into a GTK+ widget,
first inside of Inkscape, then in a <a href="https://linkmauve.fr/files/pathfinder-glarea.tar.xz">testcase
application</a>.  The
<code>Gtk::GLArea</code> widget lets an application draw using OpenGL.  I want it to
eventually replace Inkscape’s <code>SPCanvas</code>, once I’m done and <a href="https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php?title=Inkscape_Canvas">Tavmjong as
well</a>, but in
the meantime I’ll keep them both side-by-side in order to compare their
rendering more easily.</p>
<p><img src="https://linkmauve.fr/blog/2020/06/12/bringing-gpu-acceleration-to-inkscape-week-2/empty-glarea.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Despite the rendering being done, according to <code>apitrace</code>’s step-by-step
debugging, the <code>Gtk::GLArea</code> stayed hopelessly black.  Even though I could
render a simple solid colour using <code>glClearColor()</code> and
<code>glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)</code>, as soon as I tried to render using Pathfinder
it went back to a solid black.</p>
<p>Experimenting with the OpenGL contexts, I could make Pathfinder render its
iconic tiny house everywhere but where I wanted it:</p>
<p><img src="https://linkmauve.fr/blog/2020/06/12/bringing-gpu-acceleration-to-inkscape-week-2/almost-but-not-quite.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a particularly trippy rendering I got, when <code>Gtk::GLArea</code> is reading
from a framebuffer Pathfinder hasn’t written into:</p>

<p>It was only with the help of <a href="https://github.com/s3bk">sebk</a> that I finally
figured out that I wasn’t passing the correct
<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Framebuffer_Object">fbo</a> to Pathfinder.  I
was passing <code>0</code> which means the default (display’s) framebuffer instead of the
one created for me by GTK+.  With this fixed, everything rendered fine, even on
resize:</p>

<p>After that it was a simple matter of <a href="https://github.com/servo/pathfinder/pull/357">adding some API to Pathfinder’s C
bindings</a> and I can render the
same SVG as Inkscape!</p>
<p><img src="https://linkmauve.fr/blog/2020/06/12/bringing-gpu-acceleration-to-inkscape-week-2/same-svg.png" alt="">
On the left hand side we can see <a href="https://poez.io/">poezio</a>’s logo rendered by
Inkscape with cairo; on the right hand side the same logo being serialised and
passed to Pathfinder to be rendered on the GPU.</p>
<p>And this concludes my first progress report of this GSoC, a big thanks to
ebassi, halfline and Neville[m] from
<a href="xmpp:%23gtk%irc.freenode.net@irc.jabberfr.org?join">#gtk</a>, and especially sebk
from <a href="xmpp:%23pathfinder%23mozilla.org@matrix.org?join">#pathfinder</a>, who
helped me a lot in that process!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1583206699770" id="item-5e5dd025f31d6249a33b8964"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-16ea368387762e4de2e8"><div><p>I was two months into my new job in Rio de Janeiro when I asked my co-worker to hand me a hard penis.</p><p>His gaze shifted towards me and his eyes paused, narrowed, and a cheeky grin slowly came across his face. Within ten seconds the normally stoic Jose was on the floor, doubled over laughing. “Oh shit,” I thought, “What did I just say?”</p><p>It wasn’t the first time I’d made a mistake when learning Portuguese and it wouldn’t be the last. Confusing ‘pão duro’ for ‘pau duro’ (the squiggly line, the tilde, above the ‘a’) proved to be the fatal error – instead of asking for bread, like I had intended, I had asked Jose for something very different.</p><p>The nasal tone of the tilde is a critical distinction among many similarly sounding words in Brazilian Portuguese. But no matter how many times I had tried learning the language with audio tapes, YouTube videos, or through immersion, the lesson had never really sunk in until that one fatal error I made with Jose.</p><p>I now pay <em>very close attention</em> to the tilde when speaking Portuguese.</p><p>---------------------------------</p><p>There is a commonly held belief that children learn new languages faster than adults. This is largely attributed to the fact that children’s brains can form new neural pathways at rates far greater than adults – a term known as ‘neuroplasticity’.</p><p>Most parents will tell you their kids have brains like sponges – they soak up anything and everything they hear – and are quick to repeat it. Interestingly, kids seem to exhibit this sponge- like behavior in public places where they utter something like “That’s bullshit!” and leave mom and dad looking at one another thinking ‘I wonder who she heard that from?’</p><p>I agree with science - a child’s developing brain is far more adept at learning new concepts and lessons than your average adult brain. Consequences are high if they don’t – a child that doesn’t learn concepts of hot and cold, safe vs. danger, ways of expressing their wants and needs, or how to play with others is a child that falls behind, often for life. Brains <strong>have to be extremely moldable in youth</strong> – it’s how children learn the lessons required for survival into and throughout adulthood.</p><p>However, when it comes to learning new languages, I believe the science is overvalued and social factors are significantly undervalued. Adults can learn new languages just as fast, if not faster, than children given the same environment, tools, and social support systems.</p><p>Here are a few of the reasons this is true. Some of these I’ve discovered for myself, others are anecdotal:</p><p><strong>1. Adults punish themselves and one another for making speaking mistakes - children don’t.</strong></p><p>Children that misspeak, stutter, or call things by the wrong names don’t criticize themselves or laugh at one another – they just move on with life. Adults often think it’s endearing to hear kids speak to one another with such imperfection and innocence.</p><p>On the other hand, adults that misspeak, stutter, or screw up are made fun of or feel ashamed or embarrassed. There is no safe environment to practice speaking and to become better without the social stigma associated with screwing up.</p><p>The sooner you come to terms with the fact that you will sound completely, utterly, and fabulously stupid when beginning to learn a new language the sooner you will be successful.</p><p>Anxiety, embarrassment, blanking out, and stuttering will be the RULE, not the exception. Learning a new language will not be an overnight success. It will take failure and practice.</p><p><strong>2. Adults try to learn languages by learning grammar. Children learn language through basic stories, songs, and activities.</strong></p><div><p>About every child in the United States knows the book <em>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</em>. If you haven’t heard of it, here is a sample excerpt:</p><p><em>Brush Brush Brush</em><br><em>Comb Comb Comb</em><br><em>Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.</em><br><em>All girls who like to brush and comb,</em><br><em>Should have a pet like this at home.</em></p></div><p>This is not a book meant to win the Pulitzer prize. Instead, it’s meant to teach kids the importance of simple, basic phrases and words through repetition and rhyming schemes.</p><p>So why is it when adults are learning new words that we feel the need to start by reading the translated equivalent of Shakespeare? Does anyone truly enjoy learning about verb conjugations, grammar rules, tonality, and writing repetitive sentences over and over until their hands hurt?</p><p>The key to learning a new language is to start simple and work your way up, but to do it through the lens of how a child would learn. Read kids books, listen to kids music, watch kids shows, play kids games. Even something as simple as a game of Tag will teach you a great deal about language and tenses – “I’m it!” vs. “You’re it!” vs. “I <em>was</em> it!” vs. “You’re <em>going to be</em> it!”</p><p><strong>3. Adults learn languages because they are forced to. Children learn language because they don’t know any better.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Think about the first time you learned any new skill – let’s take riding a bike as an example. You had to be willing to fall and scrape your knees over and over until you finally learned to ride. As a kid learning to ride a bike was something you needed to do to play with the other kids, and falling was part of the learning curve. It was a way of life, just like having to speak in a certain language with your parents or learn to say certain words because you needed to use them.</p><div><p>Adult speakers of multiple languages often say the best way to learn is through immersion - move to the geography the language is spoken and try not to speak your native language at all. Surround yourself in the language from every angle - before long you’ll start picking language up without even knowing it. </p><p>Not everyone can pack up and move to a new country. But everyone can put themselves in situations where they are unknowingly picking up tidbits of a new language and have fun during the experience. Anybody can try meals at new restaurants where the owners/operators speak a different language, search for new Spotify stations that have music in another tongue, or attend local cultural events where someone can learn to appreciate the contrasts and similarities between their language and someone else’s. </p></div><p>-----------</p><p>If learning Portuguese taught me one thing it was this: change the environment, change the outcome. I could’ve never become as proficient in a new language without completely immersing myself, making mistakes, and enjoying the experience for what it was -&nbsp; a chance to learn more about myself and others through a common understanding of language.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In JavaScript, you can create random numbers using <code>Math.random()</code>. But what if we wanted to create our own random values in the browser without this function?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-math.random">ECMAScript Language Specification</a> defines the requirements of <code>Math.random()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns a Number value with positive sign, greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1, chosen randomly or pseudo randomly with approximately uniform distribution over that range, using an implementation-dependent algorithm or strategy. This function takes no arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Math.random function created for distinct realms must produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="number-generation"><a href="#number-generation" aria-label="number generation permalink"></a>Number Generation</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of a number generator. It uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures">closure</a> to maintain internal state and creates a sequence of numbers based off an initial seed value. Here the seed is fixed and is always initialized to <code>0</code>.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>Math<span>.</span>random <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> seed <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    seed <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> seed
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>


Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> 
Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> 
Math<span>.</span><span>random</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></div>
<p>A <strong>pseudorandom number generator</strong> (PRNG) works in a similar manner. A PRNG maintains an internal state and applies math to that state every time a new random number is requested. The seed can be manual or automatic. In the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#New">Go programming language</a>, you must seed <code>math/rand</code> yourself. In the browser, <code>Math.random</code> requests random data under the hood from the operating system (OS) to use as a seed.</p>
<p>PRNGs are deterministic. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Often, a deterministic outcome is preferred. For example, to generate the same random events on all clients without them having to talk over a network. Or for reproducible performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>A hash function can be used to create a PRNG. In <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/4b9b23521e6fd42373ebbcb20ebe03bf445494f9/benchmarks/spinning-balls/v.js">spinning-balls</a>, one of Chrome’s benchmarks, we can see an example of this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>

<p>Like our number generator, it alters its internal state while calculating the next random number. This state-change allows the next call to produce a different number.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators"><a href="#more-on-pseudorandom-number-generators" aria-label="more on pseudorandom number generators permalink"></a>More on Pseudorandom Number Generators</h2>
<p>One of the oldest and most well known types of PRNG is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG). Which, despite its somewhat scary name, does not require many lines of code.</p>
<p>@bryc provides an example and <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#lcg-lehmer-rng">a warning</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commonly called a Linear congruential generator (LCG), but in this case, more correctly called a Multiplicative congruential generator (MCG) or Lehmer RNG. It has a state and period of 2^31-1. It’s blazingly fast in JavaScript (likely the fastest), but its quality is quite poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>LCG</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>(This is the first time I’ve come across <code>Math.imul()</code> — which provides <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/imul#Description">C-like 32-bit multiplication</a> of the two parameters.)</p>
<p>What does @bryc’s comment, “its quality is quite poor” mean in this context? Well, given certain even seeds, this algorithm has a pattern when the final step (the division) is removed.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">many</a> ways to test the quality of randomness. Some of the methodology and results of these tests can be understood by a layperson. One of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Diehard battery of tests</a> plays 200000 games of craps and looks at the distribution of wins and the number of throws each game.</p>
<p>There’s also a test for LCGs called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_test">spectral test</a> which plots the sequence in two or more dimensions. In the example below, we can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplanes</a> that the spectral test measures for.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/940b3280e30ebce96af63d654d461af46f2afc28/26139/9e8cfab758735e8c6d06f733460f6a3f/lcg-3d.gif" alt="Hyperplanes of an LCG in three dimensions"></p>
</center>
<p>A PRNG eventually repeats its sequence. In this context, the <em>period</em> is the length of steps until the cycle repeats. Simpler PRNGs such as <a href="https://github.com/bryc/code/blob/master/jshash/PRNGs.md#mulberry32">Mulberry32</a> have a period as low as ~4 billion whereas the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38838863">Mersenne Twister</a> has a period of <code>2^19,937 - 1</code>. In 2015, the V8 team <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/math-random">said</a> that their implementation of <code>Math.random()</code> uses an algorithm called <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/xorshiftplus.pdf">xorshift128+</a> which has a period of <code>2^128 - 1</code>. Its introduction can been seen in <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/085fed0fb5c3b0136827b5d7c190b4bd1c23a23e/src/base/utils/random-number-generator.h#L102">this diff</a>.</p>
<p>If a PRNG eventually repeats itself, you might wonder why we call it repeatedly. Why not use the first number and then reset the internal state with a new seed? The problem with this is that the seed needs to originate from somewhere. If we continue to ask the OS for more random data there is a chance that the call may block (as the OS waits for more randomness to be generated) and our program will stall.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-required"><a href="#entropy-required" aria-label="entropy required permalink"></a>Entropy Required</h2>
<p>So you’ve settled on a PRNG and replaced <code>window.Math.random</code>. You’ve shipped it to your users and, at first, everyone seems to be happy.</p>
<p>But wait! You forgot about the seed. And now your users are complaining about the sequence of random numbers they get. It’s the same every time their customers’ page loads. All of their software is predictable. As a result, the web games they built are easy to beat.</p>
<p>Huzaifa Sidhpurwala <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-random-number-generators-and-their-limitations-linux">reminds us</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entropy is the measurement of uncertainty or disorder in a system. Good entropy comes from the surrounding environment which is unpredictable and chaotic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When required, the generation of securely random numbers in the browser is performed by <code>Crypto.getRandomValues()</code> from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#Crypto-method-getRandomValues">Web Cryptography API</a>. Which is seeded by “a platform-specific random number function, the Unix <code>/dev/urandom</code> device, or other source of random or pseudorandom data.”</p>
<p>The Linux <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/char/random.c">source</a> suggests where this pseudorandom data can come from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an outside observer to measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also hardware devices that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator#Quantum_random_properties">quantum mechanical physical randomness</a>.</p>
<p>You can find many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack#Prominent_examples">prominent examples</a> of random number generator attacks which occurred because the wrong type (or not enough) entropy was used. Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/">famously</a> uses lava lamps as an entropy source. Since we are not attempting to create a secure algorithm, predictable sources of entropy like time are fine.</p>
<p>We can use <code>Date.now()</code> our seed state. This means that we will get a different random sequence for every millisecond. We could also use <code>performance.now()</code> which returns the length of time since the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#The_time_origin">time origin</a>.</p>
<p>Other possible ways of getting entropy in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crypto.getRandomValues</code>, <code>crypto</code> key generation, or similar (feels like cheating)</li>
<li>Mouse/touch events, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Ambient_Light_Events">ambient light events</a>, mic/webcam noise (hard to use on page load)</li>
<li>Geolocation API, Bluetooth API, or similar (need permission, doesn’t work on page load)</li>
<li>WebGL/video performance shenanigans</li>
<li>Most APIs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">listed here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s our slower (because it’s not native code) and unstable (because I haven’t tested it) replacement for <code>Math.random()</code>. Also note that PRNGs have requirements for the seed state (e.g. prime numbers, 128-bit). Our algorithm doesn’t comply with the <a href="http://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf">seed recommendations</a> for the Xoshiro family.</p>

<h2 id="so-mission-accomplished"><a href="#so-mission-accomplished" aria-label="so mission accomplished permalink"></a>So, Mission Accomplished?</h2>
<p>Sadly it’s impossible to create a fully ECMAScript compliant replacement for <code>Math.random()</code> since the specification requires “distinct realms [to] produce a distinct sequence of values from successive calls.” A <em>realm</em> roughly means a different global environment (e.g. a different window, or a different <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">WebWorker</a>). Our version cannot reach outside its realm thus cannot make this guarantee.</p>
<p>However, there have been proposals for a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms API</a>. It’s not inconceivable that such an API would provide access to something like an incrementing realm id. This would give our algorithm the loophole it needs — access to Realm-unique entropy!</p>

    <p>So I found a useful command that allows you to view entire git log of the repo.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>git log --decorate --graph --oneline --all
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command generates the entire log of the git repo in one line</p>

<p>and if you like to view entire log with commit messages in detail you can run this command</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>git log --decorate --graph --all
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you found this useful and if you have further tips related to command line feel free to follow me and DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/muhammad_o7">twitter</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p><em>As of 2020-06-06 I only made those tests inside a VM (See
<a href="#libvirtd">below</a> if you want to play with it too). I’m not fully at
peace with the process yet to actually apply it on my server. Use at
your own risk!</em></p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>I’m the happy owner of a server which holds my whole infrastructure
for more than one year now, powered by NixOS for declarative
deployments. When I installed it the first time, I didn’t know about
ZFS and all its features (see <a href="https://pthree.org/2012/12/04/zfs-administration-part-i-vdevs/">there</a>
if you want some examples)</p>
<p>Since I cannot afford to reinstall everything from scratch, I had to
find a way to deploy ZFS safely (i.e. without losing redundancy).
This article explains step by step the choices I made.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>The server has a single relevant partition mounted on <code>/</code> (the other
partitions are BIOS boot and swap, non-relevant here). This partition is
a RAID1 array, backed by two disks. The partition holding <code>/</code> on the
underlying disks is the third one, that is <code>/dev/md0</code> containing
<code>/dev/sda3</code> and <code>/dev/sdb3</code>.</p>
<p>The distribution of my server is NixOS, installed remotely via
nixops. Some commands will rely on that fact below, but might be
adapted depending on your distribution (or if you don’t use
nixops)</p>
<p>I ordrered an additional disk to my server provider
(<code>/dev/sdc</code>). The sole purpose of this disk is to ensure
redundancy in case of failure during the process. The process itself
could be adapted to not need it if you’re confident enough. It can
be thrown away at the end of the process.</p>
<h2><a name="libvirtd"></a> Play with libvirtd</h2>
<p>Since I didn’t want to break my server, I created a libvirtd rough
equivalent of my setup: three disk images, two of them mounted as RAID
array. Since it is a quite specific setup, I couldn’t make a fully
declarative VM handled by nixops, but I still made use of some of
nixpkgs helpers.</p>
<p>The derivation below will produce an output with three disks image
as described above:</p>

<p>When deploying with nixops (via the libvirtd backend), you will need to
make each image available. However, nixops only handles one and only one
image, so we will need a bit of manual tasks. This is the nixops
configuration I’m using:</p>

    <span>};</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now prepare the VM. Beware, this will rapidly fill-in your /nix/store
with big images. (<code>nix-store --delete /nix/store/*libvirtd-image*</code> to
clean them selectively if you’re doing tests)</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># This command will fail due to missing images</span>
nixops deploy --create-only
<span># Find the path to images at the beginning of the output. It will be</span>
<span># slightly different from what you would get with nix-build due to</span>
<span># some parameters given by nixops</span>
<span>P</span><span>=</span>/nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-libvirtd-image

<span># Stop VM.</span>
virsh destroy nixops-...-testzfs

<span># Copy additional disks to places written in libvirtd.nix</span>
<span># For some reason, sometimes I had to replace the first disk too in</span>
<span># libvirtd folder.</span>
cp <span>$P</span>/disk2.qcow2 /path/to/disk2.qcow2
cp <span>$P</span>/disk3.qcow2 /path/to/disk3.qcow2
chmod gu+w /path/to/disk2.qcow2 /path/to/disk3.qcow2

<span># Same action done by nixops on the first disk</span>
qemu-img rebase -f qcow2 -b <span>""</span> /path/to/disk2.qcow2
qemu-img rebase -f qcow2 -b <span>""</span> /path/to/disk3.qcow2

<span># Edit libvirtd and add console configuration</span>
virsh edit nixops-...-testzfs
<span># &lt;serial type='pty'&gt;&lt;target port='0'/&gt;&lt;/serial&gt;</span>
<span># &lt;console type='pty'&gt;&lt;target type='serial' port='0'/&gt;&lt;/console&gt;</span>

nixops deploy --force-reboot
</pre></div>


<p>Now you should have a running VM containing two drives in a RAID1 array
plus one unused drive, that mimics your production server, and that I
used as a base for the migration process below.</p>
<p>In case of problem, you should be able to use <code>virsh console</code> to get an
actual console of what’s happening on your VM (as early as grub stage).
Also think of doing snapshots if you want to repeat some steps.</p>
<h2>Migration process</h2>
<h3>Add the new disk to the RAID array</h3>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Copy partitionning without boot partition</span>
sfdisk -d /dev/sda <span>|</span> grep -v ^sector-size: <span>|</span> sed -e <span>"s/21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649/0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F/"</span> <span>|</span> sfdisk /dev/sdc

<span># Add the new partition to RAID array</span>
mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --level<span>=</span><span>1</span> --raid-devices<span>=</span><span>3</span> --add /dev/sdc3

<span># Wait for synchronisation to finish</span>
cat /proc/mdstat

I would immediately dismiss it every time I saw it because I wasn't a physics extraordinaire. I did not build rockets or read thick physics theory books during my spare time. And there were a lot more qualified candidates at UBC for this award. So I didn't really consider applying for it until a week before the deadline.</p><p>I had casually<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> mentioned this award while talking with my parents over dinner, and they were confused that I hadn't applied. I came up with the usual excuses. There wasn't enough time. I wasn't a mastermind in physics. But they convinced me that I could do it and so I found myself scrambling and stressed during that one week before the deadline. I had to find reference letters from professors I had rarely talked to, and write paragraphs about a subject that I was greatly interested in but had little concrete evidence to show this interest.</p><p>A few weeks later, I got the award! And I was so close to not trying. The fear of asking for reference letters on such a tight deadline alone was almost enough to deter me. All of this was definitely out of my 80% confidence zone<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, and that's probably why I felt more excited than usual when I received the email telling me the good news.</p><p>However, not every reach out of my 80% confidence zone is a success. In high school, I applied for multiple universities in the States and did not get in a single one. I knew I was reaching a bit high, especially being an international student. It was disappointing not getting in, but I am glad that I tried.</p><p>Many times, after failures like these, I hesitate to try anything that's out of my 80% confidence zone because there is a higher risk of failing. It seems like a waste of time and energy. But if I shift my mindset, and look towards the possible reward and my own skills, it's not all that bad. Yes, I might fail<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. But I might also succeed. I think it's better than not trying and missing out on some great opportunities.</p><p>And a note on "oh, I'm not..." a funny person, an artist, a programmer, a swimmer, and &lt;insert some of your own<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->. In the past, I often told myself these absolutes. Although they might have been true in the moment, by saying these phrases, I was limiting myself and making sure I would keep these absolutes true forever. But once I changed from "oh, I'm not..." to "I could become", it gave me freedom to try things out and have a chance at success. "Could", which denotes a possibility, also allows me to accept failure.</p><p>I like to remind myself that no one is born a charismatic friend, a great writer, a professional basketball player, a famous Youtuber, an awesome doctor. They become those people because they allow themselves to reach for uncertain success.</p><p>So that's why I reach<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    <p>I care too much. This is a fact.</p>
<p>In particular, I care too much about the art of building software.</p>
<p>As time goes on, software continues to become an increasingly present and critical element in our world. I take my job as a software practitioner incredibly seriously, as I believe it is my ethical responsibility to do so. As a result, I care deeply about things like technical excellence, code quality and maintability, and treating code with the same importance as the end deliverable.</p>
<p>This care does not come without cost. On the contrary, the cost of caring is enormously high. I routinely suffer from high levels of stress and anxiety as a result of my caring about a particular matter. I am especially inundated with these adverse effects when I'm surrounded by people who don't care as much as I do.</p>
<p>Would it be healthier for me to not care so much? Almost certainly. At the very least it may slow the rate at which gray hairs are appearing on my head.</p>
<p>But, for me, not caring is not an option. I have the choice between caring too much or becoming entirely apathetic. There is no in-between. Presented with these two extremes, I would choose caring every single time.</p>
<p>Not caring is lazy. It takes work to care. There is a high cost to caring, but it is absolutely worth it.</p>

      <h3 id="a-multitenant-application">A Multitenant application</h3>

<p>Multitenancy is the concept that your application serves distinct non-overlapping accounts, with resources assigned to and belonging to each account. A simple example of this is an off-line console video game. Each game copy is bought and paid for by a single owner (“account”), and in that copy there may be some amount of gameplay saved data, development data, and user configuration which is unique and sequestered to that copy. In some cases that data may need to be synced with other copies that the user owns. For example a PC version or potentially a status update on their mobile device.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum there are open communities where no data is restricted to the users, a simplified version of Twitter is a good example. Tweets are public, anyone can read them. While a user may be able to post new tweets and delete ones they posted, the environment that user sees is a combination of all users on that platform.</p>

<p>In these extremes, access control policies aren’t that meaningful, since users either have access to nothing (except their resources) or everything. It becomes required and thus more challenging, when resources are partially shared. Take a photo sharing application. While photos may be owned by a single account, a user may want to share their photos with their friends. Additionally they could create albums which their whole family can see, or public ones they intend to demonstrate their photography prowess.</p>

<p>Users create separate accounts which have their own data, own configuration, but may need to share that data with users in that account, or users in other accounts. This is at the core of what is considered a multitenant application.</p>

<h3 id="application-resources">Application resources</h3>

<p>If we use a document repository example we can start to build out what the recommendations might be to secure that data. To start off we’ll look at the types of actions users may want to perform, these are often called user stories.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A user can create an account and provision the necessary resources, add anything to that account, and additionally a user should be able to edit. They are the Owner of that account.</li>
  <li>An account administrator would like to be able to add additional users to the account to manage the documents that are there.</li>
  <li>An account manager needs to upload documents, change documents, and delete them.</li>
  <li>A user in an account needs to be able to share a document with anyone else, or potentially just specific people, irrespective of the account the user is part of.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just some of the functionality necessary to be built into a document repository. While it is trivial to save documents (depending on their size), getting the permissions right so that they are both easy to maintain but can also provide the necessary flexibility for your users to control access they want to is difficult. We’ll walk through one possible implementation below.</p>

<h3 id="modeled-actions">Modeled Actions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create Account - Let’s assume no restricted access is necessary here, anyone can create an account.</li>
  <li>Invite User to Account - Perhaps something like
    <ol>
      <li>Resource: <strong>accounts/{accountId}/users</strong>
</li>
      <li>Permissions: <strong>AddUser/InviteUser, RemoveUser, ReadUsers</strong>
</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>List accounts - I’ll assume accounts are private. A user can only list accounts they are part of, potentially if you share a document a user might need to be able to see some aspects about that account that owns the document:
    <ol>
      <li>Resource: <strong>accounts/{accountId}</strong> and <strong>accounts/{accountId}/info</strong>
</li>
      <li>Permissions: <strong>updateName/Description, ReadAccount</strong>
</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>List documents - Need to be able to list the documents in the account
    <ol>
      <li>Resource: <strong>accounts/{accountId}/documents/(documentPath)</strong>
</li>
      <li>Permissions: <strong>AddDocument, DeleteDocument, ReadDocument, EditDocument</strong>
</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>List users - Need to be able to list users that have access to a document
    <ol>
      <li>Resource: <strong>accounts/{accountId}/documents/(documentPath)/members</strong>
</li>
      <li>Permissions: <strong>ShareDocument, RemoveAccess, UpdateAccess, AssignDocumentOwner</strong>
</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These resource uris are a good match for our user stories about a document repository. For these we would create the relevant roles. So far we listed out the permissions, since the permissions are checked by services we’ll want role abstractions that contain these permissions for the resources.</p>

<h4 id="relevant-roles">Relevant Roles</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Account Admin:
    <ul>
      <li>Will own everything about an account</li>
      <li>Permissions: *</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Account Manager:
    <ul>
      <li>Can modify users and documents</li>
      <li>Permissions: <em>AddDocument, DeleteDocument, ReadDocument, EditDocument, ShareDocument, RemoveAccess, UpdateAccess, AssignDocumentOwner</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Account Member:
    <ul>
      <li>Can modify documents</li>
      <li>Permissions: <em>AddDocument, DeleteDocument, ReadDocument, EditDocument, ShareDocument</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Document Viewer:
    <ul>
      <li>Can read a document</li>
      <li>Permissions: <em>ReadDocument, (ShareDocument)</em>
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="relevant-resources">Relevant Resources</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>accounts/{accountId}/users</strong></li>
  <li><strong>accounts/{accountId}/info</strong></li>
  <li><strong>accounts/{accountId}/documents/(documentPath)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="standard-multitenant-resource-recommendations">Standard Multitenant Resource Recommendations</h3>

<p>It can be difficult to get the resource paths just right for your application. What’s important is matching up the user stories to necessary access control checks. Since Authress provides scoped permissions and resources, the best recommendation are resource uris that looks similar to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>NS:tenants/{tenantId}/parentResources/{parentResourceId}/resources/{resourceId}/subResources/{subResourceId}</code></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>NS is a custom namespace, your usage of security policies might span across different product spaces, if these are to be separate, prefixing them goes a long way.</li>
  <li>We can separate each section of the path with hardcoded identifier. This is important so that resources of different types are easily distinguishable. If we had <strong>/{id}/{id2}</strong> it would not be possible to differentiate access to <em>/resources/{id}/<strong>sub</strong>/{id2}</em> and <em>/{accounts}/{id}/<strong>resource</strong>/{id2}</em>, since they look the same.</li>
  <li>Always scope with the tenant. There are some situations where resources might be shared, but someone fundamentally one tenant/account always ows the resource.</li>
  <li>Resources in Authress are cascading, so if there is a hierarchy relation between them, this is expressible in the resourceUri. This is a great way to automatically grant access to sub child resources when they are created without needing to create or updating access records. If a user has access to <strong>/resources/{id}</strong> then they will also have the same roles/permissions to all sub resources <strong>/resources/{id}/subResource/{sub1}</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(Another example exists in the <a href="https://authress.io/knowledge-base/zoom-case-study">Zoom Case study</a>)</p>

<p>In some cases resources are very fluid and too much scoping can be a problem, but in Authress these can be changed by updating access records and a simple migration can be used to propagate them if the access control model needs to be changed.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Supervised learning is the machine learning branch that deals with function approximation: using several input-output pairs generated by an unknown target function, construct a different function that approximates the target function. For example, the target function may be my personal movie preferences, and we might be interested in obtaining a model that can predict (approximately) how much I will enjoy watching some new movie. With such a model we can create a movie recommendation app.</p>

<p>Some functions can be easier to approximate than others (given a definition of approximation difficulty, but I won’t go down that rabbit hole right now), and some tasks can be framed as more than one function. This raises the question - do different framings result in different model performance? To find out I tried playing with two framings of a toy problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>
<p>I used the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#olivetti-faces-dataset">Olivetti faces dataset</a>, which contains grayscale, 64x64 images of the faces of 40 subjects (10 images per subject). Here are some of the faces:
<img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_sample.png" alt="Face data sample"></p>

<h2 id="the-task">The task</h2>
<p>The task is the classical face recognition task (which has been quite controversial lately due to questionable use in settings such as law enforcement). To make things more interesting, I decided to use only two images from each subject for training, and the rest as the test set. So the goal is to train a model which, given an image, outputs the subject that the model believes this face belongs to.</p>

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>I wanted to focus just on the aspects of training that pertain to the problem framing, and treat it as a general problem. For that purpose I excluded many specifics that would be very important for a real face recognition application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using existing face recognition models or <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html">existing techniques specific to face recognition</a></li>
  <li>Using <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0">data augmentation</a> to generate more training samples</li>
  <li>Obtaining more face data (even without subject information) and perform unsupervised pre-training</li>
  <li>Assigning each prediction a confidence score, and fixing a confidence threshold below which no result is reported</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I wanted to see what difference just changing the target function would make. Since the functions are different the models may be somewhat different as well, but they are trained on the same (base) data.</p>

<h3 id="performance-metric">Performance metric</h3>
<p>To measure model performance, I used the accuracy metric - percentage of correct classifications. For each framing I ran about 100 train/test splits (with two images in the training set and eight in the test set).</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>
<p>As a baseline I used a (single) nearest neighbor classifier with the L2 norm. I.e. when classifying a new face, for each face in the training set we calculate the sum of the squared differences bewteen every two pixels (in similar positions), and take as the answer the face that was closest.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/faces_knn.png" alt="Nearest neighbor face classification"></p>

<p>Intuitively it’s hard to tell how well this model would fare. On one hand there should obviously be many similarities between images of the same person (including factors 
we would have liked to exclude, such as lighting and clothing).
On the other hand, many of the similarities we perceive in faces will not be reflected in the pixel-level comparison.
In this case the performance (measured as accuracy - percent of correct classifications) of the model was about  <strong>70.5%</strong>, which is quite impressive in my opinion, considering that a random model would achieve about 2.5% accuracy on average.</p>

<p>Let’s see how a more sophisticated model fares.</p>

<h2 id="first-approach">First approach</h2>
<p>The first framing is the explicit one: given an image, we want to know whose face it is, so that’s what we’ll ask the model. The function maps images to subject identifiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/first_approach.png" alt="Mapping image to subject ID"></p>

<p>For the model I used a simple network with Keras:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Sequential</span><span>([</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>128</span><span>,</span> <span>input_shape</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>),</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
		<span>BatchNormalization</span><span>(),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>64</span><span>,</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'relu'</span><span>),</span>
		<span>BatchNormalization</span><span>(),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>),</span>
		<span>Dense</span><span>(</span><span>y_train</span><span>.</span><span>shape</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span> <span>activation</span><span>=</span><span>'softmax'</span><span>)</span>
	<span>])</span>

<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>compile</span><span>(</span><span>loss</span><span>=</span><span>'categorical_crossentropy'</span><span>,</span> <span>optimizer</span><span>=</span><span>'adam'</span><span>)</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>,</span> <span>epochs</span><span>=</span><span>1200</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I played with several variations and this seemed to be the best with regards to number of layers, their sizes and activation functions. Its test accuracy was, on average, about <strong>70.9%</strong> - an ever so slight improvement.
I think part of the challenge is that classifying faces requires relatively complex features, but we have very little training data (especially considering the number of positive instances for each class).
So the model either fails to find a pattern if the network is too small, or overfits if it’s too large.</p>

<h2 id="second-approach">Second approach</h2>
<p>Let’s try a less direct framing. We know that if two images belong to the same person, they should be relatively similar, and vice versa. Therefore, instead of training the model to identify faces, we can train the model to <em>compare</em> faces. In this case, instead of 40 classes (one for every subject) we only have two classes: “same person” or “not the same person”.</p>

<p><img src="https://andersource.dev/assets/faces_framing/second_approach.png" alt="Mapping image pairs to similarity"></p>

<p>Training this model was a little trickier:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The best architecture turned out to be pretty similar to two (“sideways”) concatenations of the first approach model, which I thought was pretty neat.</li>
  <li>Due to a vanishing gradients issue, I had to go with a slower learning rate and slow it even more as the loss decreased.</li>
  <li>This time we have an <em>imbalanced</em> classification task, so I gave the positive class a bigger weight.</li>
  <li>Training took longer and in a handful of cases (about 5 out of 100) didn’t converge and needed restarting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another difference is that using this framing, inference isn’t straightforward. Instead, we run the model on the input image along with each of the training images, and pick the subject of the image that the model deemed most similar to the input image.</p>

<p>Here is the code for the model and training:</p>

<p>The accuracy of this model was, on average, about <strong>74.4%</strong>, which is an improvement over both the first approach and the baseline. However, the spread of the results was larger, resulting in both much worse and much better runs. In this problem, a different framing made quite a significant difference.</p>

<h2 id="combined-approach">Combined approach</h2>
<p>After seeing the better average but also bigger spread of the second approach I wondered if it would be possible to create a model that optimizes for both using a non-linear computation graph.
The idea was this: each input sample would contain two faces, which would each “go through” several dense layers. The images would be transformed by the same layers separately, and the resulting representation would be used in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Classify each face</li>
  <li>Concatenate the two representations and, after several more dense layers, classify whether or not they belong to the same person</li>
</ol>

<p>I also used different weights for the two framings, which worked a little better.</p>

<p>Here’s a visual description of what’s happening:</p>

<p>This model took the longest to train. The average accuracy was <strong>73.3%</strong>, better than the baseline and the first approach but not as good as the second; however, it was much more stable and there were no incidents of non-convergence. So it seems like the combination indeed enabled us to enjoy both worlds: a little better performance while preserving stability.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Machine-aided programming tools such as type predictors and code summarizers are increasingly learning-based. However, most code representation learning approaches rely on supervised learning with task-specific annotated datasets.
                    We propose <em>Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode)</em>, a self-supervised algorithm for learning task-agnostic semantic representations of programs via contrastive learning. Our approach uses no human-provided labels, relying only on the raw text of programs.
                    In particular, we design an unsupervised pretext task by generating textually divergent copies of source functions via automated source-to-source compiler transforms that preserve semantics.
                    We train a neural model to identify variants of an anchor program within a large batch of negatives. To solve this task, the network must extract program features representing the functionality, not form, of the program.
                    This is the first application of instance discrimination to code representation learning to our knowledge. We pre-train models over 1.8m unannotated JavaScript methods mined from GitHub. ContraCode pre-training improves code summarization accuracy by 7.9% over supervised approaches and 4.8% over RoBERTa pre-training.
                    Moreover, our approach is agnostic to model architecture; for a type inference task, contrastive pre-training consistently improves the accuracy of existing baselines.

                <h2>Compiler transforms for code data augmentation</h2>
                <p>Finding equivalent programs in a dataset is challenging. In computer vision, random crops of a source image are frequently used as "equivalent" views of it for augmenting training sets or for unsupervised pre-training. However, it's challenging to define similar data augmentations for natural and programming languages. We propose to use <em>automated source-to-source compiler transformations</em> to generate augmentations of programs that preserve functionality. These transforms include dead code elimination, variable renaming and constant folding. We also explore lossy transforms like code deletion that only preserve some of the program semantics.
                <br></p>

The equivalent programs were automatically generated through compiler transformations, serving as "augmentations" or "views" of the original program.</em></p></div>

                <h2>Contrastive pre-training</h2>
                <p>
                    Contrastive Code Representation Learning (ContraCode) is a pretext representation learning task that uses these code augmentations to construct a challenging <em>discriminative</em> pretext task that requires the model to identify equivalent programs out of a large dataset of distractors. 
                    In doing so, it has to embed the functionality, not form, of the code. 
                    In essence, the domain knowledge from our code transformations induces the knowledge of the structure of programs onto learned representations.

                <h2>Finetuning on downstream tasks</h2>
                <p>
                    By learning functionality-based representations, a model pre-trained with ContraCode outperforms baselines that are are trained from scratch or pre-trained with reconstruction objectives like masked language modeling. We demonstrate these improvements by finetuning LSTM and Transformer models on type inference and code summarization tasks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="intro">
		<div>
			<div id="set-up">
				
				<p><img alt="language:" src="http://www.r2d3.us/static/app/global/world.png">: </p>
				<p>In machine learning, computers apply <strong>statistical learning</strong> techniques to automatically identify patterns in data. These techniques can  be used to make highly accurate predictions.</p>
				<p><em>Keep scrolling.</em> Using a data set about homes, we will create a machine learning model to distinguish homes in New York from homes in San Francisco. </p>
			</div>
			
			<hr>
			<div id="first-two">
				<h2> First, some intuition </h2>
				<p> Let’s&nbsp;say you had to determine whether a home is in <strong> San Francisco</strong> or in <strong>New York</strong>. In machine learning  terms, categorizing data points is a <strong>classification</strong> task. </p>
				<p> Since San Francisco is relatively hilly, the elevation of a home may be a good way to distinguish the two cities. </p>
				<p> Based on the home-elevation data to the right, you could argue that a home above 73 meters should be <strong> classified</strong> as one in San Francisco. </p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div id="add-nuance">
				<h2> Adding nuance </h2>
				<p> Adding another <strong>dimension</strong> allows for more nuance. For example, New York apartments can be extremely expensive per square foot. </p>
				<p> So visualizing elevation <em>and</em> price per square foot in a <strong>scatterplot</strong> helps us distinguish lower-elevation homes. </p>
				<p> The data suggests that, among homes at or below 73 meters, those that cost more than $19,116.7 per square meter are in New York City. </p>
				<p> Dimensions in a data set are called <strong>features</strong>, <strong>predictors</strong>, or <strong>variables</strong>. <span></span></p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div id="set-boundaries">
				<h2> Drawing boundaries </h2>
				<p> You can visualize your elevation (&gt;73 m) and price per square foot (&gt;$19,116.7) observations as the boundaries of regions in your scatterplot. Homes plotted in the green and blue regions would be in San Francisco and New York, respectively. </p>
				<p> Identifying boundaries in data using math is the essence of statistical learning. </p>
				<p> Of course, you’ll need additional information to distinguish homes with lower elevations <em>and</em> lower per-square-foot prices. </p>
			</div>
			<hr>
			<div id="more-variables">
				
				<div id="listing-the-variables">
					<!--<div id="data-table"></div>-->
				<p> The dataset we are using to create the model has 7 different dimensions. Creating a model is also known as <strong>training</strong> a model. </p>
				<p> On the right, we are visualizing the variables in a <strong>scatterplot matrix</strong> to show the relationships between each pair of dimensions. </p>
				<p> There are clearly patterns in the data, but the boundaries for delineating them are not obvious. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="from-boundaries-to-pattern">
				<hr>

				<h2> And now, machine learning </h2>
				<p> Finding patterns in data is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning methods use statistical learning to identify boundaries. </p>
				<p> One example of a machine learning method is a <strong>decision tree</strong>. Decision trees look at one variable at a time and are a reasonably accessible (though rudimentary) machine learning method. </p>
				</div>

				<hr>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div><div id="split">
		<div>
			<div id="elevation-to-histogram">
				<hr>
				<h2> Finding better boundaries </h2>
				<p> Let's revisit the 73-m elevation boundary proposed previously to see how we can improve upon our intuition. </p>
				<p> Clearly, this requires a different perspective.  </p>
				<hr>
				<p> By transforming our visualization into a <strong>histogram</strong>, we can better see how frequently homes appear at each elevation. </p>
				<p> While the highest home in New York is 73m, the majority of them seem to have far lower elevations. </p>

			</div>
			<div id="introduce-split">
				<hr>
				<h2>Your first fork</h2>
				<p> A decision tree uses if-then statements to define patterns in data. </p>
				<p> For example, <strong>if</strong> a home's elevation is above some number, <strong>then</strong> the home is probably in San Francisco. </p>

			</div>
			<div id="explain-gini">
				<hr>
				<p> In machine learning, these statements are called <strong>forks</strong>, and they split the data into two <strong>branches</strong> based on some value. </p>
				<p> That value between the branches is called a <strong>split point</strong>. Homes to the left of that point get categorized in one way, while those to the right are categorized in another. A split point is the decision tree's version of a boundary. </p>

				<hr>
				<h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
				<p> Picking a split point has tradeoffs. Our initial split (~73 m) incorrectly classifies some San Francisco homes as New York ones. </p>
				<p> Look at that large slice of green in the left pie chart, those are all the San Francisco homes that are misclassified. These are called <strong>false negatives</strong>. </p>

				<hr>
				<p> However, a split point meant to capture every San Francisco home will include many New York homes as well. These are called <strong>false&nbsp;positives</strong>. </p>
				<hr>

				<h2>The best split</h2>
				<p> At the <strong>best split</strong>, the results of each branch should be as homogeneous (or pure) as possible. There are several mathematical methods you can choose between to calculate the best split.<span></span></p>
				<hr>
				<p>As we see here, even the best split on a single feature does not fully separate the San Francisco homes from the New York ones.</p>
				<hr>
			</div>
			<div id="further-split">
				<hr>
				<h2>Recursion</h2>
				<p>To add another split point, the algorithm repeats the process above on the subsets of data. This repetition is called <strong>recursion</strong>, and it is a concept that appears frequently in training models.<span></span></p>

				<p>The histograms to the left show the distribution of each subset, repeated for each variable.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>The best split will vary based which branch of the tree you are looking at.<span></span></p> 
				<p>For lower elevation homes, price per square foot is, at $1061 per sqft, is the best variable for the next if-then statement. For higher elevation homes, it is price, at $514,500</p><p>.

				</p><hr>
			</div>

		</div>
	</div><div id="tree">
		<div>
			<div>
				<hr>
				<h2>Growing a tree</h2>
				<p>Additional forks will add new information that can increase a tree's <strong>prediction accuracy</strong>.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Splitting one layer deeper, the tree's accuracy improves to <strong>84%</strong>.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Adding several more layers, we get to <strong>96%</strong>.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>You could even continue to add branches until the tree's predictions are <strong>100% accurate</strong>, so that at the end of every branch, the homes are purely in San Francisco or purely in New York.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<hr>
				<p>These ultimate branches of the tree are called <strong>leaf nodes</strong>. Our decision tree models will classify the homes in each leaf node according to which class of homes is in the majority.</p>
				<hr>
			</div>

		</div>
	</div><div id="test">
		<div>
			<div id="classify-training-data">
				<hr>
				<h2>Making predictions</h2>
				<p>The newly-trained decision tree model determines whether a home is in San Francisco or New York by running each data point through the branches.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Here you can see the data that was used to train the tree flow through the tree.</p>

				<p>This data is called <strong>training data</strong> because it was used to train the model.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>Because we grew the tree until it was 100% accurate, this tree maps each training data point perfectly to which city it is in.</p>

			</div>
			<div id="classify-test-data">
				<hr>
				<h2>Reality check</h2>
				<p>Of course, what matters more is how the tree performs on previously-unseen data.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>To <strong>test</strong> the tree's performance on new data, we need to apply it to data points that it has never seen before. This previously unused data is called <strong>test data</strong>.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Ideally, the tree should perform similarly on both known and unknown data.</p>
				<hr>
				<p>So this one is less than ideal.<span></span></p>
				<hr>

			</div>
			<div id="misclassification">

				<p>These errors are due to <strong>overfitting</strong>. Our model has learned to treat every detail in the training data as important, even details that turned out to be irrelevant.</p>

				<p>Overfitting is part of a fundamental concept in machine learning explained in our next post.<span></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we would like to compress one or several files into one zipped file or decompress a zipped file. It is very common to use tools such as gzip, zip, or 7zip to create or decompress <code>.gz</code>, <code>.zip</code>, and <code>.7z</code> files, respectively. However, none of these tools on Linux uses multicore and multithread during compression and decompression. When the number of files are large or the file sizes are large, compression and decompression would take a lot of time using single thread.</p>



<p>Pigz is one of the parallel implementation for gzip and zip. Using pigz could greatly save us the time spent on compression and decompression. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss how to use pigz.</p>

<h3 id="pigz">Pigz</h3>

<p>The pigz usages in the blog post are mainly targeted for Ubuntu systems. However, its usages on other Linux operating systems should be almost the same.</p>

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>pigz
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="pigz-usages">Pigz Usages</h4>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pigz --help
Usage: pigz [options] [files ...]
  will compress files in place, adding the suffix '.gz'. If no files are
  specified, stdin will be compressed to stdout. pigz does what gzip does,
  but spreads the work over multiple processors and cores when compressing.

Options:
  -0 to -9, -11        Compression level (level 11, zopfli, is much slower)
  --fast, --best       Compression levels 1 and 9 respectively
  -b, --blocksize mmm  Set compression block size to mmmK (default 128K)
  -c, --stdout         Write all processed output to stdout (won't delete)
  -d, --decompress     Decompress the compressed input
  -f, --force          Force overwrite, compress .gz, links, and to terminal
  -F  --first          Do iterations first, before block split for -11
  -h, --help           Display a help screen and quit
  -i, --independent    Compress blocks independently for damage recovery
  -I, --iterations n   Number of iterations for -11 optimization
  -J, --maxsplits n    Maximum number of split blocks for -11
  -k, --keep           Do not delete original file after processing
  -K, --zip            Compress to PKWare zip (.zip) single entry format
  -l, --list           List the contents of the compressed input
  -L, --license        Display the pigz license and quit

  --                   All arguments after "--" are treated as files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A typical command for compressing and decompressing a file is like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span># Always use -k to keep the original file</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> image.png
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-dk</span> <span>-p8</span> image.gz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, vanilla pigz is not very friendly to compressing multiple files into one single file and custom output filepath. We would need to rely on tar, the archive tool.</p>

<h4 id="tar-pigz-usages">Tar-Pigz Usages</h4>

<p>Using pipe <code>|</code>, we could first archive multiple files or directories first to <code>.tar</code> file and compress using pigz to further generate <code>.tar.gz</code> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-cf</span> - data/ index.json | pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> <span>&gt;</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Decompress (Unfortunately two steps)</span>
<span>$ </span>pigz <span>-k</span> <span>-p8</span> dataset.tar.gz
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Alternatively, tar has already integrated custom compressor in its interface, which makes the command looks more clear.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Compress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -k -p8"</span> <span>-cf</span> dataset.tar.gz data/ index.json
<span># Extract file to another directory</span>
<span>$ </span><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> new_dataset
<span># Decompress</span>
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>--use-compress-program</span><span>=</span><span>"pigz -dk -p8"</span> <span>-xf</span> dataset.tar.gz <span>-C</span> new_dataset
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this article, we will give describe some strategies to reduce Amazon RDS costs. This article is part of our <a href="https://www.iobasis.com/How-to-reduce-AWS-Costs/">How to reduce AWS Costs</a> article series.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS is a relational database service. The usual way to deploy a database is by installing it on your OS. Instead, Amazon RDS provides a database-as-a-service. And AWS takes care of hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.</p>
<p>Here are some benefits that Amazon RDS brings you:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS manages the <strong>database hardware</strong> for you.</li>
<li>AWS manages the <strong>operating system</strong> (this includes configuration and patches) for you.</li>
<li>AWS manages the <strong>database</strong> service configuration and software patches for you.</li>
<li>Provides <strong>Multi-AZ</strong> deployment (this sets up a standby database instance with synchronous replication to master, and automatic failover/failback)</li>
<li>Provides database <strong>licenses</strong>, so you don’t have to acquire them.</li>
<li>Deploys <strong>Read replicas</strong> deployment.</li>
<li>Deploys <strong>automatic snapshots</strong>, and you can recover your database from any point in time within the last 35 days)</li>
<li>Deploys database <strong>at-rest encryption</strong> (with AWS KMS)</li>
<li>Deploys <strong>in-transit</strong> encryption (so you don’t need to deploy your SSL certificates)</li>
<li>Provides monitoring <strong>metrics</strong> integrated into AWS console (using CloudWatch)</li>
<li>Automatically uploads database <strong>logs</strong> to CloudWatch for a centralized management</li>
<li>Supports <strong>storage autoscaling</strong>, so you don’t run out of space when your database grows.</li>
<li>Supports <strong>IAM</strong> authentication (you store users’ credentials out of DB, so they can be used for multiple DBs or other AWS services)</li>
<li>Supports Amazon <strong>Aurora</strong> database which has additional features.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Amazon RDS will simplify the operation and maintenance of your DB. But one of the main problems with relational databases is that they scale vertically. The database grows with time. And you need to use bigger hardware. That makes database costs increase fast.</p>
<p>So our objective is to describe some strategies to reduce your Amazon RDS costs. Note that each strategy has to be analyzed with the requirements of your workload. And you should use the strategies that work best for you.</p>
<h2>1. Changing the DB engine</h2>
<p>Amazon RDS supports 6 different types of relational database engines: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.</p>
<p>These are all relational database technologies. The first 3 ones are open source database technologies. Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server are proprietary database technologies. And the last one, Amazon Aurora, is an AWS proprietary database. But it’s compatible with my MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>The following picture compares the monthly price of a db.r5.xlarge OnDemand DB engine in us-east-2 (Ohio) region using Single-AZ configuration.</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <span>
      <img alt="RDS monthly price by db engine" title="" src="https://www.iobasis.com/static/4d139c8e97d4c1b491265ddda7135d8d/5a190/RDS-monthly-price-by-db-engine-type.png" srcset="https://www.iobasis.com/static/4d139c8e97d4c1b491265ddda7135d8d/772e8/RDS-monthly-price-by-db-engine-type.png 200w,

    </span>
  </span>
  </p>
<p>These 10 DB instances all use the same HW (a db.r5.xlarge instance). But the price has a huge variation based on the DB engine type.</p>
<p>Note that the 3 open source databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB) almost have the same price. And they are the most economical. And Amazon Aurora is a bit more expensive than them.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS engine pricing includes the licensing for the corresponding database engine. So it’s not necessary to bring your license (BYOL) for this service. The cost of Microsoft (or Oracle) database licenses is already included in the RDS service price. For this reason, these are more expensive than the rest.</p>
<p>Changing the database engine is not a simple task. Not only the database data has to change. You have to make sure the code using it could also be changed. And your team has to know how to use it.</p>
<p>But having that said, it’s important to note that the type of database technology will have a big impact on your costs. If you can change the technology of your database, that could avoid the licensing fees. For example, if you change from RDS for Oracle SE2 to Aurora PostgresSQL, you will save <strong>44%</strong> monthly.</p>
<p>In case you decide to migrate your database, you can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">AWS Database Migration Service</a>. This is a tool that allows you to migrate your database (and schema) to a new engine. And it’s free (you only pay for the EC2 instance to run it).</p>
<h2>2. Using Amazon EC2 instead of Amazon RDS</h2>
<p>This strategy is probably an option that no cloud specialist will mention. But it’s worth evaluating. As we mentioned before, Amazon RDS has lots of benefits and makes the database administration much easier. But it also brings higher costs.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the cost of a database in EC2 and RDS. We will use an on-demand EC2 r5.xlarge instance which has 4 vCPUs with 32 GiB of memory. It uses the same hardware as the db.r5.xlarge database. Here are the results:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>EC2 AMI</th>
<th>EC2 Price ($)</th>
<th>RDS Price ($)</th>
<th>Savings</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Windows Server 2019 with SQL Server 2019 Enterprise</td>
<td>1393.92</td>
<td>1800.72</td>
<td>23%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Server 2019 with SQL Server 2019 Standard</td>
<td>659.52</td>
<td>1094.4</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Server 2019 with SQL Server 2019 Web</td>
<td>362.88</td>
<td>633.6</td>
<td>42%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Linux with SQL Enterprise</td>
<td>1261.44</td>
<td>1800.72</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Linux with SQL Standard</td>
<td>527.04</td>
<td>1094.4</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Linux with SQL Web</td>
<td>230.4</td>
<td>633.6</td>
<td>63%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Linux</td>
<td>181.44</td>
<td>345.6</td>
<td>47%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For example in the first row, the price of Amazon RDS with SQL Server is $ 1800.72 per month (in Ohio). If we host the in an EC2 instance with <em>Windows Server 2019 with SQL Server 2019 Enterprise</em> AMI, the price is $ 1393.92 per month. That’s <strong>23%</strong> below RDS price. And if we use it on an EC2 with “Linux with SQL Enterprise” the cost will be <strong>30%</strong> less.</p>
<p>In the last row, the price of Amazon RDS MySQL-compatible is $ 345.6 per month. But hosting the database on an EC2 with Linux AMI costs $ 181.44. That’s <strong>47%</strong> less.</p>
<p>Additionally, hosting a database on Amazon EC2 will also bring more flexibility regarding the types of EC2 instances you can choose. For example, there are 254 types of EC2 instances and only 18 RDS database instance types.</p>
<p>You can choose this strategy if you want to reduce your database costs, and you can afford the overhead of deploying and maintaining the database yourself.</p>
<h2>3. Right-Sizing your database instance</h2>
<p>This strategy consists of choosing the right database instance for your workload. The good point is that there are only 5 families of databases instances: “t”, “m”, “r”, “x” and “z”. And the number of instance types is low as well (compared with the number of AWS EC2 instance types). For example, there are currently 22 database instances for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. This makes the decision easier.</p>
<p>How to decide what is the best database instance for my workload? The right approach is to determine your database requirements (including memory, CPU, IOPs, and others). And then choosing the most cost-effective instance that complies with them.</p>
<p>You can start monitoring your database using CloudWatch Metrics for RDS. Metrics like CPUUtilization, FreeableMemory, and ReadIOPS are very useful to understand the utilization of the CPU, memory, and storage. You can also enable Enhanced Monitoring (it has a small fee). This will show how each process in the database is using memory and CPU.</p>
<p>Here is a quick approach to filter database instances. First, you visit <a href="https://www.ec2instances.info/">EC2 instances info</a>. You choose RDS and your region. Then remove the unnecessary price columns (for example, all price-related columns except “MySQL On-Demand Cost”). And afterward, you add the required GiB in the Memory filter. For example, if your database uses 9 GiB of memory, so might choose 16 GiB. You will get a list with all the instances that match this memory size, and they will be ordered by the lowest cost. For example, after setting the filters, we got only 9 database instances types. And finally, you could choose the right instance according to the estimated CPU usage. Here you have both price and hardware characteristics of the database instances, and this will simplify your decision.</p>
<p>Note that each time you switch to a smaller instance, the database half the previous size (except some specific cases). And you will save <strong>50%</strong>. That’s why it’s very important to find the right instance size for your workload.</p>
<h2>4. Using Reserved DB Instances</h2>
<p>Reserved Instances allows you to save money by committing to use the database instance for 1 or 3 years. You purchase a Reserved Instance plan, and that gives you a discount.</p>
<p>For example, here are current Amazon RDS savings expected for a MySQL database using a db.r5.xlarge DB instance in Ohio.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Payment Option</th>
<th>Monthly Price (r5.xlarge)</th>
<th>Savings over On-Demand</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>On-Demand</td>
<td>345.6</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reserved 1 year (No Upfront)</td>
<td>199.44</td>
<td>42%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reserved 1 year (All Upfront)</td>
<td>186.48</td>
<td>46%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reserved 3 year (All Upfront)</td>
<td>125.28</td>
<td>64%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Purchasing Reserved Instances will allow you to save <strong>30% to 64%</strong> (depending on the payment term, region, database engine, and instance type). So you should evaluate if this works for your workload.</p>
<h2>5. Stopping and Starting database engines</h2>
<p>The database instance is charged proportionally to the time it’s running. You can stop your testing instances after business hours, or when they aren’t used. This can be done using the console. Or you can automate stopping (and restarting) the database instances at certain times of the day.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that you use some database instances on standard business hours only. That’s 45 hours a week (out of 168 hours). So you will save <strong>73%</strong> of the costs of this database instance.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that when your database is not running, you will still pay for the storage and snapshots used. Additionally, a database can be stopped for up to 7 days. After this period, AWS will start it automatically.</p>
<p>Stopping and starting the database instances is available only to instances with Single-AZ configuration and without Read replicas.</p>
<h2>6. Using Aurora Serverless</h2>
<p>In case you are using Aurora, you can switch to Aurora Serverless. It automatically scales the database instance hardware (assigning up to 488 GiB of memory). AWS charges you proportionally to the provisioned compute in terms of ACUs.</p>
<p>But apart from autoscaling, Aurora Serverless will pause your database if you aren’t using it. When that happens, you will only be charged for storage (but not for the DB instance).</p>
<p>The most important point is that the database instance will scale to accommodates current usage. In …</p></div></div>

We've always been a big proponent of this because while relationships will always be an important aspect of every facet in life - innovations come from all kinds of founders. </p><p>If your product or company are amazing, you should have access to funds -- no matter your background. </p><p>Some funds may have specific details on their website about a) if they have an open round or are open to new deals b) how to send your submission. </p><p>If they don't, there are always ways to find out!</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Social Links:</strong></p><p>LinkedIn,&nbsp;Twitter,&nbsp;Angel.co, Crunchbase, Pitchbook, F6S... the list goes on, but we just selected a few. This is not an invitation to bombard them :) . It is an invitation to listen &amp; see past investments.</p><p>VCs are more active on&nbsp;LinkedIn &amp;&nbsp;Twitter. Often their thoughts are posted on potential investments, the market, and general ideas. Our mate <a href="http://haystack.vc/" target="_blank">Semil&nbsp;Shah with&nbsp;Haystack</a>'s <a href="https://twitter.com/semil" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account is full of great insight. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Applicable Portfolio&nbsp;Companies:</strong></p><p>Are there any companies you know / are connected to? Any portfolio companies in your industry?</p><p>Founders who successfully raised are amazing resources, and most of the time - they are happy to lend a hand or intro.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Verticals:</strong></p><p>Does the fund only invest in specific verticals/industries? We included a few common ones here, but feel free to edit. </p><p>If a fund only invests in FinTech &amp;&nbsp;Enterprise SaaS platforms, your Medical Device will not even be looked at. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Average Investment Size &amp;&nbsp;Deals Per Year:</strong></p><p>Both these columns can be identified together. This will determine if the fund is the right fit based off your ask &amp; what your chances are to receive funding.</p><p>Some investors make a handful of investments a year at $3-5M each, others do 30 at $1M each, and large funds may invest in a large number for both check size &amp; deals.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Key Metrics,&nbsp;Requirements, and Notes:</strong></p><p>Many investor websites openly state what metrics (traction, ARR, team, geography, etc.) they look for. You can also take a quick look at their portfolio &amp; make some assumptions. </p><p>Use this column as a junk drawer of random notes if needed. </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Connections:</strong></p><p>We don't know every investor in the world, nor do we pretend to! What you will quickly find is the investor world, especially in specific verticals, is small. We use these columns to see if there are any shared connections who could offer insight or intros to outside our investor network. </p><p>You can do the same &amp; use the founder method if needed.</p><p>If we have an awesome AgTech company that would be a perfect fit for a CVC, we may not know the venture arm - but we may know someone at the corporation who can provide some insights or an intro.</p><p>VERY&nbsp;TARGETED outreach can be done delicately, just don't come off as a spammer. :) Scratch that, just talk to us first! </p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Contacts:</strong></p><p>This is linked to the CONTACTS tab. It is a good place to connect specific folks to the fund. The team pages are full of insights into which LP / investor works in which vertical. Integrate this into your CRM once you start communicating with them.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Feedback:</strong></p><p>Linked to the PITCH&nbsp;FEEDBACK&nbsp;TAB. As mentioned, this is an Aleberry thing - but we find it helpful when working with both funds &amp; founders. </p><p>This tab is incredibly helpful for noticing patterns. </p><p>ASK&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;FEEDBACK &amp;&nbsp;TAKE&nbsp;IT&nbsp;KINDLY. We can not stress the latter enough. An investor not only reviewed your deck, but they are willing to give you some insights on why they passed. Listen &amp; decide if the advice is applicable or not, but don't burn bridges.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Industry Companies:</strong></p><p>This will auto-populate from the INDUSTRY&nbsp;COMPANIES&nbsp;tab. More on that below.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Contacts:</h3><p>This one needs a lot less explanation. It's basically your Rolodex for contact information. Make sure to tie the name to fund for Tab One. We added the last two columns on initial contact &amp; last contacted, but don't always use those. If you are not using a CRM for Investor Relations - these two columns may be helpful.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Industry&nbsp;Companies</h3><p>Are there any companies in your industry / vertical that have successfully raised? Who did they raise from?&nbsp;This is a fantastic way to identify funds that will be further down your pipeline. It may also give you an in if you know the company.</p><p>While you should identify direct competitors, you should note that funds will not invest in direct competition. This may eliminate a fund for you, while also giving you insight into a similar raise. </p><p>Tag the funds! </p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h3>Pitch&nbsp;Feedback:</h3><p>We included a few common themes that we see, but you should add simple phrases here. Tag the Main INVESTOR&nbsp;Tab.

    <p>
    Several programming languages allow programmers to define (potentially
    recursive) custom types, by composing together existing ones. For instance,
    in OCaml, one can define lists as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>type 'a list =
| Cons of 'a * 'a list
| Nil
</pre>
    <p>
    This translates in Haskell as
    </p>
    <pre>data List a =
  Cons a (List a)
| Nil
</pre>
    <p>
    In Rust:
    </p>
    <pre>enum List&lt;A&gt; {
  Cons(A, Box&lt; List&lt;a&gt; &gt;),
  Nil,
}
</pre>
    <p>
    In Coq:
    </p>
    <pre>Inductive list a :=
| cons : a -&gt; list a -&gt; list a
| nil
</pre>
    <p>
    And so forth.
    </p><p>
    Each language will have its own specific constructions, and the type systems
    of OCaml, Haskell, Rust and Coq —to only cite them— are far from being
    equivalent. That being said, they often share a common “base formalism,”
    usually (and sometimes abusively) referred to as <i>algebraic datatypes</i>. This
    expression is used because under the hood any datatype can be encoded as a
    composition of types using two operators: sum (<span>+</span>) and product (<span>*</span>) for
    types.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <span><span title="var">a</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">b</span></span> is the disjoint union of types <span><span title="var">a</span></span> and <span><span title="var">b</span></span>. Any term of <span><span title="var">a</span></span>
        can be injected into <span><span title="var">a</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">b</span></span>, and the same goes for <span><span title="var">b</span></span>. Conversely,
        a term of <span><span title="var">a</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">b</span></span> can be projected into either <span><span title="var">a</span></span> or <span><span title="var">b</span></span>.
     </li>
     <li>
      <span><span title="var">a</span></span> <span>*</span> <span><span title="var">b</span></span> is the Cartesian product of types <span><span title="var">a</span></span> and <span><span title="var">b</span></span>. Any term of <span><span title="var">a</span></span> <span>*</span>
        <span><span title="var">b</span></span> is made of one term of <span><span title="var">a</span></span> and one term of <span><span title="var">b</span></span> (remember tuples?).
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    For an algebraic datatype, one constructor allows for defining “named
    tuples”, that is ad-hoc product types. Besides, constructors are mutually
    exclusive: you cannot define the same term using two different constructors.
    Therefore, a datatype with several constructors is reminescent of a disjoint
    union.  Coming back to the <span><span title="var">list</span></span> type, under the syntactic sugar of
    algebraic datatypes, the <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> type is equivalent to <span><span title="var">unit</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>*</span> <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span>,
    where <span><span title="var">unit</span></span> models the <span><span title="var">nil</span></span> case, and <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>*</span> <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> models the <span><span title="var">cons</span></span> case.
    </p><p>
    The set of types which can be defined in a language together with <span>+</span> and
    <span>*</span> form an “algebraic structure” in the mathematical sense, hence the
    name. It means the definitions of <span>+</span> and <span>*</span> have to satisfy properties
    such as commutativity or the existence of neutral elements. In this article,
    we will prove some of them in Coq. More precisely,

<h2 id="1">
An Equivalence for <span><span title="keyword">Type</span></span>
</h2>
<p>
Algebraic structures come with <i>equations</i> expected to be true.  This means
    there is an implicit dependency which is —to my opinion— too easily
    overlooked: the definition of <span>=</span>. In Coq, <span>=</span> is a built-in relation that
    states that two terms are “equal” if they can be reduced to the same
    “hierarchy” of constructors. This is too strong in the general case, and in
    particular for our study of algebraic structures of <span><span title="keyword">Type</span></span>. It is clear
    that, to Coq’s opinion, <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span> is not structurally <i>equal</i> to <span><span title="var">β</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span>, yet
    we will have to prove they are “equivalent.”
</p>
<h3 id="2">
Introducing <span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span>
</h3>
<p>
Since <span>=</span> for <span><span title="keyword">Type</span></span> is not suitable for reasoning about algebraic
    datatypes, we introduce our own equivalence relation, denoted <span>==</span>.  We say
    two types <span><span title="var">α</span></span> and <span><span title="var">β</span></span> are equivalent up to an isomorphism (denoted by <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span>
    <span><span title="var">β</span></span>) when for any term of type <span><span title="var">α</span></span>, there exists a counter-part term of type
    <span><span title="var">β</span></span> and vice versa. In other words, <span><span title="var">α</span></span> and <span><span title="var">β</span></span> are equivalent if we can
    exhibit two functions <span><span title="var">f</span></span> and <span><span title="var">g</span></span> such that:

In Coq, this translates into the following inductive types.
</p></div>

<div><p>
As mentioned earlier, we prove two types are equivalent by exhibiting
    two functions, and proving these functions satisfy two properties. We
    introduce a
</p><tt>
Ltac
</tt><p>
notation to that end.

The tactic <span><span title="var">equiv</span></span> <span><span title="keyword">with</span></span> <span><span title="var">f</span></span> <span><span title="var">and</span></span> <span><span title="var">g</span></span> will turn a goal of the form <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span> into
    two subgoals to prove <span><span title="var">f</span></span> and <span><span title="var">g</span></span> form an isomorphism.

<h3 id="3">
<span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span> is an Equivalence
</h3>

<p><span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span> is an equivalence, and we can prove it by demonstrating it is
    (1) reflexive, (2) symmetric, and (3) transitive.
</p>
<p><span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span> is reflexive.
</p></div>

This proof is straightforward. A type <span><span title="var">α</span></span> is equivalent to itself because:

If <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span>, then we know there exists two functions <span><span title="var">f</span></span> and <span><span title="var">g</span></span> which

The Coq standard library introduces the <span><span title="var">Equivalence</span></span> type class. We can
    provide an instance of this type class for <span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span>, using the three
    lemmas we have proven in this section.

<h4 id="5">
<span><span title="var">list</span></span>’s Canonical Form
</h4>
<p>
We now come back to our initial example, given in the Introduction of this
    write-up. We can prove our assertion, that is <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">unit</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>*</span> <span><span title="var">list</span></span>
    <span><span title="var">α</span></span>.
</p></div>

<div>
<h4 id="6">
<span><span title="var">list</span></span> is a Morphism
</h4>
<p>
This means that if <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span>, then <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span>. We prove this by
    defining an instance of the <span><span title="var">Proper</span></span> type class.
</p></div>

<div><p>
The use of the <span><span title="var">Proper</span></span> type class allows for leveraging hypotheses of the
    form <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span> with the <span><span title="tactic">rewrite</span></span> tactic. I personally consider providing
    instances of <span><span title="var">Proper</span></span> whenever it is possible to be a good practice, and
    would encourage any Coq programmers to do so.

    reveals an alternative implementation of <span><span title="var">non_empty_list</span></span>. More precisely,
    we can prove that <span><span title="keyword">forall</span></span> <span>(<span title="var">α</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span title="keyword">Type</span>),</span> <span><span title="var">non_empty_list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>*</span> <span><span title="var">list</span></span> <span><span title="var">α</span></span>.  It
    is a bit more cumbersome, but not that much. We first define the conversion
    functions, then prove they satisfy the properties expected by
    <span><span title="var">type_equiv</span></span>.
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="9">
The <span><span title="var">sum</span></span> Operator
</h2>

<h3 id="10">
<span><span title="var">sum</span></span> is a Morphism
</h3>
<p>
This means that if <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">α'</span></span> and <span><span title="var">β</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β'</span></span>, then <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">β</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">α'</span></span> <span>+</span> <span><span title="var">β'</span></span>. To
    prove this, we compose together the functions whose existence is implied by
    <span><span title="var">α</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">α'</span></span> and <span><span title="var">β</span></span> <span>==</span> <span><span title="var">β'</span></span>. To that end, we introduce the auxiliary function
    <span><span title="var">lr_map</span></span>.
</p></div>

<p>
Then, we prove <span><span title="var">sum</span></span> is a morphism by defining a <span><span title="var">Proper</span></span> instance.

    You don't want to focus on details like request handling or page rendering.
    You want your application to continue to work
    even when JavaScript is unavailable.
    You just want to write your web application in C++ without sacrificing interactivity.
    Wt allows you to focus on functionality and create highly interactive, secure, and future proof applications
    quickly.

    Wt has a lot to offer. It includes the essential basic widgets and building blocks to
    build web applications, but also offers built-in security, PDF rendering, a 2D and 3D painting system, 
    an object-relational mapping library, a charting library, and an authentication framework.

          <h4>Server side, client optimized</h4>
          <p>Wt employs a signal-slot system. Instead of worrying about the sending of Ajax requests and serving of pages, you can simply connect the click of a button to a callback function on the server.
    
      <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/widgets/forms#form-simple">Take a look at this example in the widget gallery.</a>
    
    
    Wt will use whatever technology available for communication: Ajax or WebSockets, but will fall back on full HTML
    page loads when JavaScript is unavailable. This makes Wt applications accessible to any browser or web crawler.

          </p>
          <h4>Built-in security</h4>
          <p>
    Wt automatically protects against misuse by only allowing visible and enabled widgets to be interacted with.
    This also helps to avoid CSRF attacks, which are doubly avoided because Wt does not store session information in cookies.
    By using the widget abstraction, Wt discourages the inserting of raw HTML into a web page, preventing XSS attacks.
    
      Wt::Dbo prevents SQL injection by encouraging the use of prepared statements when accessing the database.
    
    Wt also includes an authentication and registration system with support for OAuth
    providers like Google, Facebook, and OpenID Connect.

          <h4>2D and 3D painting system</h4>
          <p>
    Use a single 2D drawing API with many backends (PNG, JPEG, SVG, HTML canvas, VML, and PDF) so you only need to write
    your drawing code once to support any web browser and save to many formats. Write server-side (OpenGL) and
    client-side (WebGL) 3D graphics with a uniform API. Wt's 2D and 3D charting libraries were built on top of this
    graphics API.

<p><em>This blog post is a follow-up to <a href="https://nbaksalyar.github.io/2020/05/19/rust-debug.html">A Future for Rust Debugging</a></em></p>

<p>Why developers are reluctant to use interactive debuggers and prefer <code>print</code>s instead?</p>

<p>This is a question that has been perplexing me, and while it’s not possible to have a definite answer, we can make some educated guesses.
<code>print</code>s are simple and very effective: you don’t have to painstakingly step through your code to understand what’s happening
and you don’t need any external tools – everything is already there, you just need to add a few statements and run your program again.</p>

<p>Here’s the trick, though: if you code in a language like Python, JavaScript or Ruby, all you need to do to run your program is to execute it.
But there is a bit more friction with compiled native languages like C++ or Rust: every recompilation step costs time, and with larger
code bases with many dependencies it can quickly become non-negligible. It’s even more complicated if you want to debug a problem that occurs on a remote machine (e.g., a production server) or on an embedded platform, since you will need to redeploy the newly compiled binary every time you want to run a new debug experiment.</p>

<p>Interactive debuggers solve these problems: you can take an existing program that was compiled in the debug mode and probe it to your liking,
setting up conditional breakpoints, looking up current values of variables, and doing a lot of other useful things. However, in my view, the widely-used interactive debuggers have a set of problems of their own:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of them were designed in a different era. At that time, we didn’t have always-on Internet connections, high-resolution multi-colour displays, and devices with many gigabytes of memory. While the fundamental principles remain the same, the modern needs have changed and so do modern means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many existing debuggers are general-purpose. While there is some support for scripting and language-specific extensions, it’s harder to use them for specific domains and it’s harder to integrate them with your dev environment. In practical terms, this means you have to use <em>other</em> tools in addition to debuggers to observe the behaviour of your software, and oftentimes it’s just easier &amp; faster to move along with <code>print</code>s instead of trying to find a suitable tool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I also see more general problems with regards to debuggers. They are perceived mostly as a tool to help you find and fix bugs in your code, but not as much as a tool of discovery and exploration. It’s been 8 years since Bret Victor published his “<a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming">Learnable Programming</a>”, and these ideas are as relevant today as ever. Debuggers should strive to be a good learning tool too.</p>

<p>Lastly, interactive debuggers rely on underlying principles that are quite similar to profilers, dynamic tracers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTrace">DTrace</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eBPF">eBPF</a>, memory leak detectors, and other developer tools. Ideas and code can – and should – be shared across this ecosystem, but it seems like whilst one type of tools gets a lot of attention, the others may still lack support for important features.</p>

<p>So what can we do to try solving these problems?</p>

<h2 id="elements-of-a-modern-debugger">Elements of a modern debugger</h2>

<p>In my <a href="https://nbaksalyar.github.io/2020/05/19/rust-debug.html">previous article</a>, I argued for a case of extending the existing debuggers to provide better support for Rust. However, after some more research and thinking, I feel that we should consider the idea of creating a new debugger framework from scratch, taking inspiration from other great projects. Not-invented-here syndrome aside, I think there are some valid reasons for going in this direction.</p>

<p>Modern languages like Rust have lots of new important features that weren’t available in languages that the classic debuggers were written in. Things like fearless concurrency, first-class modules &amp; packages, async I/O and zero-cost abstractions can affect the design of a new debugger in a significant way. With the Rust’s package manager, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">Cargo</a>, extensibility becomes even more relevant and viable. We’ve already seen what modular debuggers are capable of – for example, the Illumos Modular Debugger, <a href="https://illumos.org/books/mdb/preface.html">mdb</a>, allows to debug both native and JavaScript code in Node.js with an <a href="https://github.com/joyent/mdb_v8">mdb_v8</a> extension, and the architecture of the debugger itself allows to extend it further using a simple, modular interface. With language features like traits, it can become even easier to create your own domain-specific debuggers using a new framework.</p>

<p>Another project to take inspiration from is <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a>, a Go debugger. It’s built with modern tools and has several features important for Go developers, but I want to highlight the <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/api/json-rpc">JSON-RPC API</a> it provides. This API addresses the important problem of integration with the development environment, and by using <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">a well-defined protocol</a> we can create an ecosystem for debuggers that’s similar to the one that’s flourished around the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language server protocol</a>. With an HTTP-based API, we can build custom debugger front-ends using HTML and WebAssembly and run them in web browsers. With the rich front-end tools &amp; frameworks, it opens up lots of interesting options for data representation and visualisation. Integration doesn’t have to be one-sided, too: language servers can be reused for debugging purposes, and integrating a Rust-specific debugger with the Rust compiler would allow us to utilise the full power of the existing language syntax parser and other compiler components.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Overall, I believe this is a project worth building. While we’re seeing a lot of innovation in compilers and language design, debuggers are somewhat neglected, even though debugging is no less important; as Kernighan’s law postulates, it’s twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.</p>

<p>Creating a new debugger is an insurmountable task and a very long journey. But it can have a modest start: if we cover only a few popular operating systems and a few simple cases first, we can quickly achieve small wins that can save us a lot of time and frustration.</p>

<p>This post outlines the initial project plan for <strong><a href="https://github.com/headcrab-rs/headcrab">Headcrab</a></strong>, a Rust debugger library. I will be publishing more code and documentation in the coming weeks. If you are interested in updates, please <a href="https://twitter.com/nbaksalyar">follow me on Twitter</a>. Progress updates will be also published on this blog.</p>

				A few years ago, I started doing small projects with the 65C02 processor to build up to using it to make a graphing calculator. There are a few different languages that you can use to write programs for this processor with assembly offering the best performance. One of the projects I worked on is an optimizer to make assembly programs run faster. It works by tracing program flow then assigning fixed addresses to local variables in functions instead of storing them on the stack. To figure out how much of an improvement the optimizer adds, I made a game in Python then ported it to both traditional assembly and the new optimized assembly format. I also ported the game to C and Forth to see how fast they are compared to the assembly versions.

			<h2>Why 65C02?</h2>
			
			</a><p><a name="Why6502">
				The </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC_65C02">65C02</a> is an improved version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502</a> used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">first</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">two</a> computers made by Apple. Because the 65C02 is made with more modern CMOS transistors, it’s much more energy efficient and runs at up to 14 MHz, compared to the 1-3 MHz of the original 6502. Both of these things make it a good choice for a graphing calculator. For comparison, the very common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series#TI-83_Plus">TI-83+</a> made by Texas Instruments has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</a> running at 6 MHz. Since the Z80 needs 3-4 times more cycles to accomplish the same work as a 6502, a 65C02 running at full speed should be 7-9 times more powerful than the Z80 in a TI-83+. Another advantage of the 65C02 is that it’s still sold in a DIP package, so it’s easy to find and experiment with on a breadboard. There aren’t many better choices in a throughhole package. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68000</a> is more powerful MHz for MHz, but it's already used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-89_series">TI-89</a>, so I would like to use something different. Some throughhole microcontrollers have much more processing power, though not much RAM and no way to add more without an external address bus. The throughhole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontrollers#PIC32M_MIPS-based_line">PIC32</a>, for example, runs at up to 50 MHz, but only has 64 kB of RAM. For comparison, the TI-89 introduced in 1998 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_49/50_series#49G">HP-49G</a> from 1999 had 256 kB and 512 kB of RAM respectively. Since the 65C02 has an open address bus, there is no limit to the amount of RAM and ROM it can access.
			</p>

			<a name="TheLanguages">
			<h2>The Languages</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are the languages that I want to compare:
			</p>
			</a><ol><a name="TheLanguages">
				<li><b>Traditional assembly</b> - This is plain old 65C02 assembly. Like many 65(C)02 (ie 6502 or 65C02) programs, it uses the X register as a stack pointer for a data stack (more details on this below). Some functions copy and save data from the fastest region of memory called zero page to free it up for use and restore the data when the function ends (more details on this below too).</li>
				<li><b>Optimized assembly</b> - This version of the game differs from traditional assembly since it doesn’t use the X register as a data stack pointer. Instead, local variables in each function are assigned a fixed address at compile time. The addresses are determined by a Python script that analyzes the flow of the program and tracks how much memory each function needs (more details below).</li>
				</a><li><a name="TheLanguages"><b>C</b> - This version is compiled with </a><a href="https://cc65.github.io/">CC65</a>, which seems to be the most popular C compiler for the 65(C)02.</li>
				<li><b>Forth</b> - This version is compiled using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/scotws/TaliForth2">Tali Forth 2</a>. I picked this Forth since it generates subroutine threaded code (STC) which is generally the fastest, though largest, type of Forth code.</li>
			</ol>

			<a name="TheSimulator">
			<h2>The Simulator</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/65C02_Emulator">65C02 Emulator on GitHub</a></p><p>
				All of the code runs on a JavaScript-based simulator I made that works in the browser. The simulation itself runs very fast on a separate thread using a web worker, while the main page is only responsible for the interface. This setup lets the simulation run at the equivalent of 40-50 MHz, several times faster than an actual 65C02 running at 14 MHz. Because it runs in the browser, you can try each version of the game for yourself:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TradAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Traditional assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/OptAsm/main.html">Robot Game - Optimized assembly version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/CC65/main.html">Robot Game - C version</a><br>
				<a href="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/TaliForth2/main.html">Robot Game - Forth version</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has sixteen memory banks of 16 kB each for a total of 256 kB of memory. The 65C02 has a 16 bit address bus, so it can only address 64 kB of memory at a time. To access the memory outside of the first 64 kB, the simulator simulates a memory banking system. Each 16 kB range of the 64 kB address space can point to any of the sixteen memory banks. This was a common strategy in retro computers to get around the limitations of a small address space.
			</p>

			<p>
				Memory map:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>0x0000 to 0x01FF - No banking</li>
				<li>0x0200 to 0x3FFF - Memory window 1</li>
				<li>0x4000 to 0x7FFF - Memory window 2</li>
				<li>0x8000 to 0xBFFF - Memory window 3</li>
				<li>0xC000 to 0xFFDF - Memory window 4</li>
				<li>0xFFE0 to 0xFFFF - Peripherals</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The first 512 bytes are not banked since they contain the fast zero page memory and the hardware stack which always need to be visible from all banks. The last 32 bytes are for peripherals like the keyboard and for vectors for reset and interrupts. Each peripheral is assigned a specific address in this range, and the processor communicates with them by reading and writing to those addresses. Four bytes in the peripheral region control which of the sixteen memory banks each window points to. For example, if memory window 2 points to memory bank 7, then reading the first byte of memory window 2 at 0x4000 will access the first byte of memory bank 7 which is at 0x1C000.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The video memory is mapped one byte per pixel and takes up the 32 kB from 0x10000 to 0x17FFF (memory banks 5 and 6). The resolution is 256x128. Each byte has two bits each of red, green, and blue. Valid color codes are therefore 0-63.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The simulator has some interesting tools that helped port the game. Some of them were added during development because a specific problem arose that I needed to add them for. The main page lets you step through the code and shows the status of all the registers and each memory region that it accesses. There is also a memory viewer and a log of exactly which instructions have been executed. Copying this information into Excel or a text diff program helped track down several bugs in the game.
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_simulator.png" alt="Screenshot of simulator Robot Game runs on">
			<span>Simulator debug interface</span></p><p>
				Getting the cycle counts right for the executed instructions was a little tricky. For example, when an X-indexed instruction fetches an address where adding X to the low byte of the address overflows and the high byte of the address has to be adjusted, the instruction takes an additional cycle. After I got the logic for that fixed, the test code I was using was still a few cycles out of 3.5 million cycles off. Single stepping the program through all of those cycles to figure out which instruction was off would take too long. Instead, I loaded the code into the <a href="http://exifpro.com/utils.html">Kowalski simulator</a> then used a Python script to automate pressing the single step button and record the cycle count for every instruction. This generated way too much data to load into a spreadsheet, so I made another script to compare those cycles to the ones I generated in my own simulator and tracked the problem down to incorrect cycle times for the STZ instruction.
			</p>

			<a name="TheGame">
			<h2>The Game</h2>
			<span></span></a><p><a href="https://github.com/JoeyShepard/RobotGame">Robot Game on GitHub</a></p><p>
				The game is made in Python with the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/">PyGame library</a>. It was easy to read one big image into memory then copy parts of it into individual tiles that PyGame draws to the screen. Here are the images I came up with in Paint:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_tiles.png" alt="Graphics tiles for Robot Game">
			<span>Graphics tiles for Robot Game</span></p><p>
				Several of these are tiles that I was experimenting with that didn’t make it into the game. Bright magenta (0xFF00FF) and bright cyan (0x00FFFF) are replaced with transparency when the tiles are created. Most of the tiles only have placeholder colors and are used as the basis to create other tiles. For example, the green, yellow, and grey color in the generic crystal graphic above are filled in depending on what type of crystal the game needs to draw:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_crystals.png" alt="Crystal tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The rock and lava tiles are constructed similarly from the generic tile above. There are four dirt tiles that are colored slightly differently and rotated at 90, 180, and 270 degrees to give the background some variety:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_dirt_tiles.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				There is only one type of monster which is always colored the same, so a few tiles like that don’t have any pixels that change colors. Adding in some stats and a randomly generated map gets us to the main game window:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_main_screen.png" alt="Dirt tiles for Robot Game"></p><p>
				The map is formed from the output of a random number generator. Using the same generator algorithm for each port results in the same beginning map for all four versions (and the same gameplay if the player makes the same decisions). I had to try several seed values for the RNG until I got a map I liked the look of as seen in the screenshot above. Here are a few that didn’t make the cut:
			</p>

			<p><img src="http://calc6502.com/RobotGame/images/RobotGame_failed_maps.png" alt="Random maps for Robot Game that failed"></p><p>
				The rest of the game is just the three menu screens. The first displays a couple of stats and an inventory page. Moving the cursor over an item shows that item’s stats and what is currently equipped in that slot. Equipping an item changes the color of the corresponding part of the robot to match. In the tiles page above, the image of the robot is drawn with different colors that all correspond to the same colors that the generic item tile has. This means that the easy find and replace function to color in the individual items also works with the same color information on the larger image of the full robot.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Lets be frank, the Internet is simply unusable with all the ads floating around.</p><p>I use the <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uBlock Origin</a> extension in my browser, as do most of the people reading this genre of articles, but the same is not true for the majority of the population, including other members of my family. So in order to enhance their web browsing experience I decided to block ads at the DNS level.</p><p>But why stop there I thought, why not also improve their privacy while I'm at it. So I also decided to setup a VPN. Now let me clarify some things here, I'm not a big fan of VPNs, the way they're advertised by the big companies, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVDQEoe6ZWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great video by Tom Scott</a> explaining what I mean. But they also have their use cases, some of which are:</p><ul><li>Prohibiting ISPs from collecting data on my browsing patterns</li><li>Circumvent internet censorship</li><li>Connect to my home network from anywhere</li></ul><p>I took a look at apps like <a href="https://blokada.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blokada</a> and <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DNS66</a> which grant you device wide ad blocking on mobile devices. On Android <a href="https://block.blokada.org/post/2018/06/17/how-does-blokada-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the way this works is</a>, by creating an internal VPN on the phone, so that all traffic from the device can be routed via it, and it has a file with all the blacklisted domains, to filter out traffic.</p><p>But there's a caveat with this approach. I cannot use another VPN to route my traffic, due to an Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/VpnService" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limitation</a>.</p><blockquote><p>There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.</p></blockquote><p>This means my browsing patterns are still accessible to my ISP. So, I started looking for ad blocking DNS servers, so that I could point Android's global DNS to it. I found <a href="https://adguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdGuard</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PiHole</a> to be the top projects. Hosting these at home, on Raspberry Pi seemed like a plausible solution, but then again one can't use it while traveling. The solution is to obviously host it on a publicly accessible server. Amongst the two I found AdGuard more appealing due to the following reasons</p><ul><li>It has out of the box support for DNS-over-TLS</li><li>It maintains a single file for its entire configuration</li><li>It's written in Golang, and is much lighter on resources compared to PiHole</li></ul><p>You can find more about their differences <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#how-does-adguard-home-compare-to-pi-hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Both are great projects, but AdGuard met my requirements perfectly.</p><p>When it comes to VPN, I did not even consider using OpenVPN, <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WireGuard</a> was the obvious choice, because of it's speed, smaller, easily auditable codebase (not that I was going to audit it, but still), cross platform compatibility and integration into the Linux Kernel.</p><p>Being a big fan of Kubernetes and maintaining infrastructure as code, I wanted a way to be able to easily deploy and version control my deployment. After much searching I stumbled upon, <a href="https://github.com/squat/kilo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kilo</a>, a network overlay built on WireGuard for Kubernetes. It could do exactly what I wanted, while also enhancing the security of my cluster, by encrypting the inter pod communication, and allowing me to build secure clusters, over nodes spanning multiple cloud providers. Also it would give me the added benefit of easily debugging applications deployed on my Kubernetes Cluster, since when connected I would be a peer on the network, thereby getting access to the all the private IPs of the deployments, services etc. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPz_DAOOCKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this talk by Lucas Servén Marín</a> to know more.</p><p>Without further ado, let's jump right into the setup. I'll be explaining the steps for setting it up on a <a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">k3s</a> cluster. You may need to modify them as per your cluster. After deploying k3s, the 1st thing which needs to be done is to setup kilo. First download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manifest</a> for kilo on k3s.</p><pre><code>curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squat/kilo/master/manifests/kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>Now you need to modify and add <code>- --mesh-granularity=full</code> to the <code>DaemonSet</code> section under the <code>args</code> for the <code>kilo</code> container.</p><pre><code>...
containers:
- name: kilo
  image: squat/kilo
  args:
  - --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig
  - --hostname=$(NODE_NAME)
  - --mesh-granularity=full
  env:
  - name: NODE_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: spec.nodeName
...
</code></pre><p>This is done to ensure all our nodes are meshed together regardless of the datacenter. Then simply apply the manifest.</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f kilo-k3s.yaml
</code></pre><p>This will later be useful for setting up WireGuard VPN. More on this later. Now we can proceed to setup AdGuard. Here is the spec for AdGuard.</p><pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: adguardhome
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: adguardhome
  replicas: 1
  strategy:

          hostPath:
            path: "/path/to/store/conf"
            type: DirectoryOrCreate
        - name: adguard-logs
          hostPath:
            path: "/path/to/store/work"
            type: DirectoryOrCreate

      containers:

          image: adguard/adguardhome:v0.102.0
          ports:

              protocol: UDP
            - containerPort: 53
              hostPort: 53
              protocol: TCP
            # DNS over TLS
            - containerPort: 853
              hostPort: 853
              protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - name: tls-cert-secret
              mountPath: /certs
            - name: adguard-config
              mountPath: /opt/adguardhome/conf
            - name: adguard-logs
              mountPath: /opt/adguardhome/work

      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 20

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: adguardhome
  labels:
    app: adguardhome
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: adguardhome
  ports:
  - port: 80
    # targetPort: 3000
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP

</code></pre><p>The <code>RollingUpdate</code> is intentionally configured to not wait till a new pod is up, and directly terminate the existing pod during deploys. On the surface it seems like an anti-pattern, but since I'm using the <code>hostPort</code> directive, a new Pod wouldn't get scheduled unless port <code>53</code> was available on the host for it to bind to, so the existing Pod has to terminate before a new Pod can be deployed.</p><p>Also I initially intended to use a <code>ConfigMap</code> for holding the <code>AdGuardHome.yml</code>, but there was some issue with AdGuard trying to write to it while initally comming up, but since <code>ConfigMap</code>'s are moundted as <code>ReadOnly</code>, Pod creation used to fail, so I decided to go with a Volume instead, until I could figure out the issue.</p><p>For the initial setup, the AdGuard admin UI will be accessible on port 3000, so you'll have to switch the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>3000</code> in the <code>adguardhome</code> service initially, access the admin UI, setup the password, and then revert the <code>targetPort</code> to <code>80</code>.</p><p>You may also enable <code>DNSSEC</code> under <code>DNS Settings</code> for guaranteeing authenticity of DNS responses by signing them, and making tampering detectable.</p><p>The volume mounts for <code>tls-cert-secret</code> are only necessary if you want to enable DNS-over-TLS. And you need to configure your ingress resource before mounting it here.</p><p>For enabling DNS-over-TLS, on the AdGuard admin UI you can goto <code>Encryption Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Enable Encryption</code>, and put in the Certificate path as <code>/certs/tls.crt</code> and the Key path as <code>/certs/tls.key</code>. Again let me re-iterate that your Ingress resource needs to be configured properly and you need to have a valid TLS certificate for the domain you're hosting AdGuard on.</p><p>On Android phones for Android Pie and later, you may goto <code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>WiFi and Internet</code> -&gt; <code>Private DNS</code>. Select <code>Private DNS Hostname Provider</code> and set it to the domain name to the once you've configured on. You may also configure it on your home router to ensure all the devices get DNS level Ad Blocking.</p><p>This concludes the AdGuard part of the setup.</p><hr><p>Now coming to setting up WireGuard.</p><p>I'll be referring to the k3s cluster as the server and the local laptop as the client from here on.</p><p>You'll need WireGaurd installed on both your server and client machine. Follow the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps as per your distribution</a> to install the same. If you're using a bleeding edge distro like Archlinux or Gentoo, you don't need to do anything on the server side, since WireGuard is already baked into the kernel at this point. On the client side however you'll need to install it for getting the command line client to enable / disable the interface.</p><p>Another useful tool to have on the client side is <code>kgctl</code>. You can install it using</p><pre><code>go get github.com/squat/kilo/cmd/kgctl
</code></pre><p>Now we need to create a private and a public key pair on the client.</p><pre><code>wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey &gt; publickey
</code></pre><p>This'll create 2 files with the respective key contents. This key pair needs to be authorized on the server. You can do this simply by creating a peer resource. Create a file named <code>archie.yaml</code></p><pre><code>apiVersion: kilo.squat.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Peer
metadata:
  name: archie
spec:
  allowedIPs:
  - 10.120.120.1/32 # This is just and example, you can use any valid available CIDR here
  publicKey: CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY # Enter the public key here, the one you just generated
  persistentKeepalive: 10
</code></pre><p>Finally apply the manifest</p><pre><code>kubectl apply -f archie.yaml
</code></pre><p>Remember, the <code>allowedIPs</code> should be a valid CIDR, which is available on both the server and the client. Now we can use the <code>kgctl</code> tool to generate the <code>peer</code> section of the client WireGuard config.</p><pre><code>kgctl showconf peer archie
</code></pre><p>This will return something like</p><pre><code>[Peer]
AllowedIPs = 10.42.0.0/24, 10.42.0.0/32, 10.4.0.1/32
Endpoint = YOUR_SERVER_IP:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 10
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY
</code></pre><p>Create a file on the client named <code>adgaurd.yaml</code> at the location <code>/etc/wireguard</code> and add the following contents to it</p><pre><code>[Interface]
Address = 10.120.120.1/32 # Use the same CIDR whitelisted in the Peer manifest
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY # The one you generated above on your client
DNS = YOUR_SERVER_IP # Enter the IP of the server to block ads, FQDN don't work on Android for some reason

[Peer]</code></pre></div></div></div>

<h3>In order to make Twitter a more productive and engaging forum for public discourse, substantial changes need to be made to the productâ€™s core architecture and user policy</h3>

<p>When I first joined Twitter in 2012, it was a great place to be. A lot of my friends were there, cracking jokes and posting pictures with yfrog while hoping the fail whale didnâ€™t ruin the fun. I recall that the company was pitching Twitter as a â€œpublic agoraâ€�, which made sense but wasnâ€™t an accurate reflection at that time. Really, it was juxtaposed against Facebook as a better social network.</p>

<p>Now that Twitter <em>is</em> the public agora, its functionality defines the rules of engagement for public debate, and those rules allow for chaos and massacre. Twitterâ€™s current functionality gravely endangers the future of the Republic. If they do not take it upon themselves to act now, they will be responsible for the American equivalent of moving the capital from St. Petersburg to Moscow.</p>

<p>I know that sounds a little alarmist, because it is. However, Twitter can take a few steps to reverse their role in warehousing division and hate. As well as the mental health crisis that is outrage. â€œThe medium is the messageâ€� has become trite, but Mcluhanâ€™s point remains - Twitter needs to alter the medium before Americans succumb to the message. Here are a few ideas to do so:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Federate Twitter</li>
	<li>Hide Likes</li>
	<li>Reform the Quote Tweet</li>
	<li>Sentiment Analysis, Higher Quality &amp; Lower Speed</li>
	<li>Tweet Wrapper =&gt; Thread</li>
	<li>Clean Up Usernames</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="federate-twitter">Federate Twitter</h2>
<p>The most audacious ask. People already use terms like â€œbaseball Twitterâ€� or â€œVC Twitterâ€� as if they were clearly federated channels - why not actually do that?</p>

<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, the aggregation of all my interests into one feed is amazing (and why no one visits news sites anymore), but in practice the intended effect hardly occurs. Usually my feed is plagued with the story of the day as if Iâ€™m turning on cable news.</p>

<p>Yes, itâ€™s possible to tune it out sometimes, but that comes at the expense of missing out on other great content. I donâ€™t want to follow Brian Koppelman or Buster Olney for their political takes, even if I agree with them 100%, I want to learn about storytelling and get updates on baseball.</p>

<p><strong>Deescalating</strong> the politicization of <em>everything</em>, and reducing the speed at which takes come flying through the Twittersphere, will turn down the temperature and volume while providing for deeper engagement.</p>

<p>The way to do this would be to require users to tag the vertical(s) they want to post in before posting. <strong>The follower would then see the tweet only if they follow both the person and the vertical.</strong> Users would be able to follow all of someoneâ€™s tweets if they want, but it would require one extra step - as the default follow functionality would result in only seeing the nexus of that personâ€™s tweets and your follow tags.</p>

<p>Users would still be able to tweet without specific channels tagged. Only followers selecting all tweets or just personal (non-vertical) tweets would see them.</p>

<p>In terms of defining verticals, Twitter can do most of the leg work - defining the official taxonomy with layups like Football &gt; NFL &gt; Cleveland Browns. And with multiple entry points like Tech / Money / Cryptography &gt; Cryptocurrencies &gt; Bitcoin. There are easily thousands that can be defined (Topics is a far cry from what could be). Then figure out how to allow users to define new categories, maybe put the blue check to good use!</p>

<p>The upshot? <strong>This would also be a great business decision.</strong> Twitterâ€™s Q1 2020 CPM was $4.97. If they were to fully embrace contextual advertising, leveraging their first-party data as well, they could own a burgeoning segment of the digital ad market and raise their avg CPM well into double digits. Think about it, has a Twitter ad ever actually made an impact on you? Contextual is the natural response to the death of the cookie, most competition in this space wonâ€™t have the first party data nor the free inventory.</p>

<h2 id="hide-likes">Hide Likes</h2>
<p>Make likes only visible to both the liker and likee. Twitter is optimized for virtue signalling, period. Weâ€™ve all read how tribal Twitter is, well this single feature is the forcing function of that tribalism in every last vertical.</p>

<p>By making likes private, Twitter can still use the signal to optimize the home feed algo. In fact this will provide a much richer signal as the likes become a more honest indication of someoneâ€™s opinions, while preserving the personal satisfaction (dopamine) users get from likes. Iâ€™d wager this would make engagement go <em>up</em>!</p>

<p>What about the ability to scan someone elseâ€™s likes? Maybe this is where a new Quote Tweet comes in. A separate feed created by users that allows them to syndicate tweets without the full endorsement of a Retweet or the aforementioned problems of a like. No footprint on the tweet object itself.</p>

<h2 id="reform-the-quote-tweet">Reform the Quote Tweet</h2>
<p>On April, 6 2015 the Quote Tweet was born. I do not believe it an accident that, at least anecdotally, the culture of outrage and personal attack has grown exponentially on Twitter in the last 5 years. â€œDunkingâ€� on someone seems to be the primary use of the Quote Tweet feature, and so many of the viral outrage tweets are in the form of the Quote Tweet.</p>

<p>Now, users were hacking this together before it happened so itâ€™s obviously a popular feature. It makes sense; syndicating information is the primary purpose of Twitter - whether thatâ€™s from your brain or another source, everyoneâ€™s just a router. But the madness must stop.</p>

<p><b>Solutions</b></p>
<p>Add permissions on any tweet that gets Quote Tweeted:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a user comes by my tweet via a Quote Tweet, allow me to block them from viewing my  tweet via the Quote Tweet</li>
	<li>Allow me to set max absolute Quote Tweets or max Retweet of a subsequent Quote Tweet</li>
	<li>Allow me to disable Quote Tweets all together</li>
</ul>

<p>OR, drum roll pleaseâ€¦ <em>edit button</em>! It would solve so much. Then add a versionsioning system to allow the original to be preserved.</p>

<p>Federation will actually solve this, but without it, these solutions are necessary.</p>

<h2 id="sentiment-analysis-higher-quality--lower-speed">Sentiment Analysis, Higher Quality &amp; Lower Speed</h2>
<p>One of the questions raised by the federation idea is, what happens to generally public features like Trends? Twitter as a resource for breaking news canâ€™t be disputed at this point; that functionality must be preserved and strengthened. But the current set up just aint it.</p>

<p>Here are two tweets taken from two recent trends, â€˜Susan Collinsâ€™ and â€˜Nancy Pelosiâ€™ respectively.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>F*ck Trump<br>F*ck Barr<br>F*ck Lindsey Graham<br>F*ck Mitch McConnell<br>F*ck Susan Collins<br>F*ck Ted Cruz<br>F*ck John Cornyn<br>F*ck Tom Cotton<br>F*ck Cory Gardner<br>F*ck Chuck Grassley<br>F*ck John Kennedy<br>F*ck Matt Gaetz<br>F*ck Jim Jordan<br>F*ck Kelly Loeffler<br>F*ck Rand Paul</p><p>F*CK THE ENTIRE GOP <a href="https://t.co/PR0KyoE5K8">pic.twitter.com/PR0KyoE5K8</a></p></div>— JosÃ© (@yoruguaenusa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yoruguaenusa/status/1281774758967889921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2020</a></blockquote>


<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">â�¦<a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a>â�© â�¦<a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpeakerPelosi</a>â�© Sums it well <a href="https://t.co/OnsAyce9Mp">https://t.co/OnsAyce9Mp</a></p>— nicole (@nicole47877716) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicole47877716/status/1281977304567222274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>Both of these were less than 20 tweets into the â€œTopâ€� section that is ostensibly a filter of quality compared to the â€œLatestâ€� option. Twitter has to stop this type of hyperbolic outrage, and nonsensical filler. Those tweets are of no value to anyone (not to mention, inciting violence?).</p>

<p>If those same accounts wanted to make reasoned and informed arguments against those politicians, by all means. Even if the arguments are far outside the Overton window, so long as they are thoughtful they should be surfaced equally.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis, scoring primarily thoughtfulness, can raise the quality bar. Modern advances in NLP should make this not only possible but possible to do well.</p>

<p>Secondly, sentiment analysis should be used to grade tweets that begin to go viral. Auto-braking tweets at certain Retweet and reply counts could be detrimental when serious breaking news occurs, so that will have to be a consideration. But scoring the sentiment to make sure itâ€™s not vitriolic outrage based in emotion could lower the speed of hate and reduce the collective blood pressure.</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy effect</a> should be the governing principle. If you cap Retweets and replies in absolute numbers or by sentiment, and the content is actually good enough, it will continue to rise to the top over time.</p>

<h2 id="tweet-wrapper--thread">Tweet Wrapper =&gt; Thread</h2>
<p>Threads are awesome, but thereâ€™s a reason services like unroll exist. Reading a thread interrupted by the username, picture, etc. every 280 characters is taxing. Secondly, syndication of a tweet in a thread can lose all context.</p>

<p><b>Solution</b></p>

<p>Convert the thread into a single object segmented by 280 character fields, separated either by nothing or slightly darker/lighter backgrounds. The reader sees breaks every 280 characters like normal, but itâ€™s much cleaner and more importantly - will convey a sense of coherence. The world is an incredibly nuanced place. Discourse in 280 characters is not.</p>

<p>The user can then choose which tweet in the thread serves as a wrapper. And/or when Retweeted, that user can choose which tweet will serve as the wrapper. The wrapper is more or less a headline - when the user clicks on the wrapper tweet, they move to the seamless thread.</p>

<p>This solution has the additional benefit of synchronizing replies onto a single thread object.</p>

<h2 id="clean-up-usernames">Clean Up Usernames</h2>
<p>So much of the nonsensical outrage comes from usernames like â€˜jack09324189â€™. The username from the Pelosi example above is â€˜nicole47877716â€™, and the account is following 5 people with one follower.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m against a strict real name policy - but Twitter can also make a constitutive choice that bifurcates users into real names and pseudonyms. If youâ€™re going to use a real name - great, you must have a real profile. If you want to be anonymous - great, you must set up a truly pseudonymous account. The strangle between the two is what accounts for most of the filler in replies.</p>

<p>Facebook is obviously a bit draconian with their policy, <em>but at least they have one</em>. If Twitter is to be …</p></div>

<h2>Introducing crsh: a Javascript based command line shell</h2>
<p>12 July 2020</p>
<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://github.com/curlywurlycraig/crsh">GitHub link -&gt; Install instructions</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Existing shells generally operate with their own somewhat archaic syntax,
continuous with the underlying operating system and set of historical design choices.</p>

<p>This puts the majority of shell syntax just out of reach for a very large subset of command line users who use the command line for little more than launching one or two command line tools, navigating directories, and maybe ocassionally piping commands or outputting them to files. These users will usually write scripts in a language more familiar to them as soon as things get a little trickier (because the value of learning the control flow syntax in <code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, or <code>fish</code> does not seem like time well spent).</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of those shells, exactly. But it does highlight a potential space for new shells that can better fulfill the needs of these users. Conversely, if you are an experienced bash shell scripter, and terms like “file descriptors” and <code>SIGCHLD</code> mean something to you, you will probably dislike my approach here. But please feel free to stick around and provide some advice.</p>

<h2 id="enter-crsh">Enter crsh</h2>

<p>I’ve started work on a shell that can seamlessly interoperate Javascript syntax (and in fact works by <code>eval</code>ing JS in the Deno runtime) and traditional shell execution.</p>

<p>Regular command execution will be familiar to those who have used the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls | grep .js
builtins.js
dsh.js
functions.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And inline anonymous functions will be familiar to those who have used Javascript:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span>
<span>Hello</span> <span>world</span><span>!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Returning a list from an inline function will be outputted as separate lines:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>).</span><span>fill</span><span>().</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`Line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>0</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>1</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>2</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>Line</span> <span>4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Combining these concepts can yield a very expressive shell:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>ls</span> <span>|</span> <span>({</span> <span>lines</span> <span>})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>lines</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>((</span><span>line</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>`line </span><span>${</span><span>index</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>line</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> <span>grep</span> <span>line</span> <span>3</span>
<span>line</span> <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>js</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note in the above that <code>lines</code> is made available to piped inline functions.
JSON output piped into an inline function is automatically parsed and made available as a <code>json</code> parameter:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/58611129-2dbc-4a81-a72f-77ddfc1b1b49 | ({ json }) =&gt; json.title
My Neighbor Totoro
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As can be seen, such a shell lends itself very well to parsing JSON (it is <em>Javascript</em> Object Notation after all).</p>

<p>To go one step further in this example, we can navigate multi-request JSON API calls in a human-readable way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span>curl</span> <span>https</span><span>:</span><span>//ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/ | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].people | xargs curl | ({ json }) =&gt; json[0].name</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While the above may look less readable than something like <code>jq</code>, those with a Javascript background will appreciate the transferability of knowledge. Even without such a background, the advantage of executing arbitrary logic inline with other shell calls in a modern language should be apparent.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Currently, the easy parts to configure are the prompt and auto-completion rules. This is done by way of editing the JS source directly. The prompt is specified as a function which returns a string, and exported from a <code>prompt.js</code> file like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>magenta</span><span>,</span> <span>stripColor</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"https://deno.land/std/fmt/colors.ts"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>prompt</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>currentDir</span> <span>=</span> <span>magenta</span><span>(</span><span>Deno</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>());</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>`</span><span>${</span><span>currentDir</span><span>}</span><span> › `</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>promptLength</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>stripColor</span><span>(</span><span>prompt</span><span>()).</span><span>length</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the auto-completion rules are specified as a list of objects representing the regex to match the input on, and the logic to return the list of completion to cycle through:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>gitRules</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git add /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeFile</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git checkout /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git branch -D /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeBranches</span><span>,</span>
  <span>},</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>match</span><span>:</span> <span>/^git /</span><span>,</span>
    <span>complete</span><span>:</span> <span>completeCommands</span>
<span>];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Community-made auto-completion rules and prompts could be hosted in the usual <a href="https://deno.land/x">Deno way</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>There is still a lot to do to make this better. Bug fixes, features like multiline support, persisting history, etc. Any feedback is welcome in the form of issues in the GitHub repo.</p>

<![CDATA[The Future of Online Identity Is Decentralized]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Online identity</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity">Online&nbsp;identity</a> refers to the concept of "being" in the digital world. As an internet user, you exist. You create accounts on websites. You write on social media and blogs. You post photos. All this online activity has in common that one and the same person performed these actions; it defines your "online&nbsp;identity".</p>
<p>However, your "online&nbsp;identity" is not <em>per se</em> representative of your "social&nbsp;identity" in the physical world.</p>
<p>You may choose to use your own name or a pseudonym. You may choose to publish personally identifiable information or not. You may choose to remain truthful to your social identity or deceive. In short, you may choose for authenticity or for anonymity.</p>
<h2>Authenticity versus anonymity</h2>
<p>Authenticity and anonymity aren't mutually exclusive and that is the beauty of the internet. In the physical realm, you are (mostly) limited to a single social identity. In the digital space, there are no such restrictions. While you can't embody multiple persons in the offline world, you can have several identities online. In fact, you can even have multiple accounts on the same platform, opting for a different balance between authenticity and anonymity for each one of them.</p>
<p>The anonymity has its downsides, creating psychological artifacts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect">online&nbsp;disinhibition</a> and facilitating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying">cyberharassment</a>. However, even though we are far from completely overcoming these challenges, the internet that allows us to remain anonymous is still the one we should want and fight for.</p>
<h2>Consolidation of identity and internet corporations</h2>
<p>Removing the possibility for anonymity could solve the problem of online toxicity. Large internet corporations like Google and Facebook allow all to create an account on condition that some personally identifiable information is revealed, usually a phone number.</p>
<p>The benefit is that it deters most from repeatably creating new accounts when older accounts have been flagged or banned due to improper behavior. These companies gain the function of "identity provider": they manage your online identity that can be used to login in different locations of the internet. We all know many websites that offer a "Google login" or "Facebook login".</p>
<p>But there is a problem: handling the entire online identity of a single person is too much responsibility for any corporation or organization, especially if it is in their interest to gain intimate individual knowledge and sell it (Google) or use it to manipulate moods and influence decision making (Facebook).</p>
<p>That phone number that was once used to prevent online toxicity is now the first of many pieces of personally identifiable information that these corporations will seek and use to figure out who you are.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to hide"? Great. The internet corporations will still make money hand over fist by selling your personality, your preferences, your buying patterns and your vote. And not just yours. That of entire populations.</p>
<p>Know that profits are just the tip of the iceberg. Governments all around the world are also interested in knowing what their citizens think, say and do for very different motives.</p>
<h2>Going decentralized</h2>
<p>The solution is relatively simple. When you create a new account and get to choose between "Google&nbsp;login", "Facebook&nbsp;login" and "Email&nbsp;login", pick "Email&nbsp;login".</p>
<p>The benefit of not giving away any more personal data and tracking possibilities outweigh the inconvenience of having to fill in your email address and a password, especially when using a password manager. As tempting as the alternative is, making these changes will improve your life and ultimately, when enough people join these efforts, that of the world population.</p>
<p>A different problem arises: how to prove online identity when decentralized?</p>
<h2>Decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>When you are no longer relying on an identity provider to manage your entire online identity, you lose the one common thing all your accounts on different platforms had: if two accounts on different online platforms are created by the same Google or Facebook account, we can safely assume they belong to the same person.</p>
<p>But this "trust by proxy" is lost when the accounts on those platforms were created without identity provider. And whether authentic or anonymous, it can sometimes be extremely useful to know and trust that separate accounts on the internet belong to the same person, even when not knowing who this person is.</p>
<p>The username is not sufficient to identify accounts across platforms. If you are "Alice" on one website, chances are you might need to be "Alice123" on the next one. And what if someone close to you is contacted by an "Aliss" requesting an amount of money to be transferred because they believe you to be in some sort of trouble? A poor attempt at impersonation, I know… Don't worry, a real bad actor will put in more effort and make a much more convincing act.</p>
<h2>Proving decentralized online identity</h2>
<p>What if not only your online identity is decentralized, but also the tool to prove said online identity? This would mean that you wouldn't need to depend on a single company or entity to prove your identity across platforms. Decentralized identity, decentralized proofs!</p>
<p>Such solutions are already being deployed in industry, for example by firms like <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio.tech</a> which focus on blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Built for individuals, I recently launched <a href="https://keyoxide.org/">Keyoxide</a> which uses cryptographic keypairs to accomplish decentralized identity verification. While it doesn't (and shouldn't!) link an account to a person in the physical realm, it links accounts across platforms.</p>
<p>If you trust an account on one platform, you can trust any other account on any other platform as long as they are both verified by "identity proofs" stored in the same keypair. Whether you choose authenticity or anonymity, decentralized identity proofs allow you to build a cross-platform online identity.</p>
<p>Here's my <a href="https://keyoxide.org/9f0048ac0b23301e1f77e994909f6bd6f80f485d">Keyoxide profile</a>. In this case, I link to several "authentic" accounts but I could easily generate a new keypair void of personal data that links to several anonymous accounts. The accounts don't need to be authentic to create an online persona.</p>
<p>All the accounts listed in the link above belong to me. No one else could claim these accounts. Here's how.</p>
<h2>Identity proofs</h2>
<p>An "identity proof" is nothing more than a link to an account A on some platform P stored inside your keypair K. If a "proof verification tool" such as Keyoxide follows this link and discovers some piece of data linking back to keypair K (which is only possible if keypair K and account A on platform P belong to the same person), the account is verified. If this proof verification is done for several accounts on different platforms, it is beyond reasonable doubt that the same person owns said accounts.</p>
<p>No bad actor could claim one of your accounts: the piece of data that links back is specific to your keypair, not the bad actor's keypair. And the bad actor also couldn't insert a proof inside your keypair as long as your keypair isn't compromised. Only you, the owner of the keypair, can add new proofs. But the entire world can read and verify them.</p>
<p>These identity proofs are decentralized because Keyoxide doesn't store them, your cryptographic keypair does. Keyoxide simply reads the keys and verifies the proofs. When you remove a proof from your keypair, Keyoxide will no longer have access to it. You own your proofs and your online identity.</p>
<p>In fact, the proofs are readable by everyone and are not specifically designed for Keyoxide. Anyone can use any tool or create new ones to verify these proofs and developers are encouraged to enrich this field with additional tools and services. Let's build a decentralized identity ecosystem we can all trust.</p>
<h2>Online identity beyond today's internet</h2>
<p>Initiatives like <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid">Solid</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a> are paving the way for a new internet where all data is owned by the user and shared with platforms with consent and restrictions. This would solve the online identity problem: you get the benefits of a "pseudo centralized" account while maintaining full ownership over all account-related data stored on a decentralized platform. Social media would be allowed to see some data, messaging platforms some other data. But there would still be one single account to rule all the platforms.</p>
<p>On today's internet, the best we can do is make fully separated accounts, link them using technologies like decentralized online identity proofs and create our own online personas, with our own open tools that ensure we maintain ownership over them.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is the fourth part in a series about introducing the Rust language to JavaScript developers. Here are the past chapters:</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="Pattern-Matching"><a href="#Pattern-Matching" title="Pattern Matching"></a>Pattern Matching</h2><p>To understand Pattern Matching, let’s start with something familiar in JavaScript - Switch Case.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example that uses <code>switch case</code> in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>print_color</span><span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>color<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"rose"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"roses are red,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>"violet"</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"violets are blue,"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"sugar is sweet, and so are you."</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"rose"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"violet"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>print_color</span><span>(</span><span>"you"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust code:</p>

<p>Most of the code should be immediately understandable. The <code>match</code> expression has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code><span>match</span> VALUE <span>{</span>
  PATTERN1 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION1<span>,</span>
  PATTERN2 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION2<span>,</span>
  PATTERN3 <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> EXPRESSION3<span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The fat arrow <code>=&gt;</code> syntax might trip us up because of the similarities with JavaScript arrow functions but they’re unrelated. The last pattern that uses underscore <code>_</code> is called the catchall pattern and is similar to the default case in switch case. Each <code>PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION</code> combination is called a <code>match arm</code>.</p>
<p>The above example doesn’t really convey how useful pattern matching is - it just looks like switch case with a different syntax and a fancy name. Let’s talk about destructuring and enums to understand why pattern matching is useful.</p>
<h2 id="Destructuring"><a href="#Destructuring" title="Destructuring"></a>Destructuring</h2><p>Destructuring is the process of extracting the inner fields of an array or struct into separate variables. If you have used destructuring in JavaScript, it is very similar in Rust.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>blue<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

<span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"shesh"</span><span>,</span> city<span>:</span> <span>"singapore"</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>city<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here’s the same example in Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Person <span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
  city<span>:</span> String<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> rgb <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>96</span><span>,</span> <span>172</span><span>,</span> <span>57</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>[</span>red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>]</span> <span>=</span> rgb<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> red<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> green<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> blue<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> Person <span>{</span> name<span>,</span> city <span>}</span> <span>=</span> person<span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> city<span>)</span><span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="Comparing-Structs"><a href="#Comparing-Structs" title="Comparing Structs"></a>Comparing Structs</h2><p>It’s very common to write “if this then that” type of code. Combining destructuring and pattern matching allows us to write these type of logic in a very concise way.</p>
<p>Let’s take this following example in JavaScript. It’s contrived but you have probably written something like this sometime in your career:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> point <span>=</span> <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> x<span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span> point<span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>x <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is zero and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span>y <span>===</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is zero`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span><span>`x is </span><span><span>${</span>x<span>}</span></span><span> and y is </span><span><span>${</span>y<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s write the same code in Rust using pattern matching:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> Point <span>{</span>
  x<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
  y<span>:</span> i32<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> point <span>=</span> Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>match</span> point <span>{</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"both are zero"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Point <span>{</span> x<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> y <span>}</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"x is zero and y is {}"</span><span>,</span> y<span>)</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a bit concise compared to the <code>if else</code> logic but also might be confusing as we’re performing comparison, destructuring and variable binding at the same time.</p>
<p>This is how it looks like visually:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-1.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://www.sheshbabu.com/images/2020-rust-for-javascript-developers-4/pattern-matching-rust-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We begin to see why it’s named as “pattern matching” - we take an input and see which pattern in the match arms “fits” better - It’s like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=shape+sorter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shape sorter</a> toys that kids play with. Apart from comparison, we also do variable binding in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th match arms. We pass variables x or y or both to their respective expressions.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is also <code>exhaustive</code> - that is, it forces you to handle all the possible cases. Try removing the last match arm and Rust won’t let you compile the code.</p>
<h2 id="Enum"><a href="#Enum" title="Enum"></a>Enum</h2><p>JavaScript doesn’t have Enums but if you’ve used TypeScript, you can think of Rust’s Enums as a combination of TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enums</a> and TypeScript’s <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#discriminated-unions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discriminated Unions</a></p>
<p>In the simplest case, Enums can be used as a group of constants.</p>
<p>For example, even though JavaScript doesn’t have Enums, you might have used this pattern:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> DIRECTION <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  FORWARD<span>:</span> <span>"FORWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  BACKWARD<span>:</span> <span>"BACKWARD"</span><span>,</span>
  LEFT<span>:</span> <span>"LEFT"</span><span>,</span>
  RIGHT<span>:</span> <span>"RIGHT"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>BACKWARD<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>LEFT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>case</span> DIRECTION<span>.</span>RIGHT<span>:</span>
      console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
      <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>DIRECTION<span>.</span>FORWARD<span>)</span><span>;</span> </code></pre>
<p>Here, we could’ve defined the FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT as separate constants, yet grouping it inside the DIRECTION object has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT and RIGHT are namespaced under DIRECTION so naming conflicts can be avoided</li>
<li>It is self-documenting as we can quickly see all the valid directions available in the codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some problems with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if someone passes NORTH or UP as an argument to move_drone? To fix this, we can add a validation to make sure that only values present in the DIRECTION object is allowed in the move function.</li>
<li>What if we decide to support UP and DOWN in future or rename LEFT/RIGHT to PORT/STARBOARD? We need to find all the places where similar switch-case or if-else is used. There’s a chance that we might miss out a few places which would cause issues in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enums in strongly typed languages like Rust are more powerful as they solve these problems without us writing extra code.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a function can take in only a small set of valid inputs, Enums can be used to enforce this constraint</li>
<li>Enums with pattern matching force you to cover all cases. Useful when you’re updating Enums in future</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the equivalent Rust example:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Direction <span>{</span>
  Forward<span>,</span>
  Backward<span>,</span>
  Left<span>,</span>
  Right<span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>direction<span>:</span> Direction<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> direction <span>{</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Forward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Backward <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Backward"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Left <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Left"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Right <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Move Right"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>move_drone</span><span>(</span>Direction<span>:</span><span>:</span>Forward<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We access the <code>variants</code> inside Enum using the <code>::</code> notation. Try editing this code by calling “move_drone(Direction::Up)” or adding “Down” as a new item in the Direction enum. In the first case, the compiler will throw an error saying that “Up” is not found in “Direction” and in the second case, the compiler will complain that we haven’t covered “Down” in the match block.</p>
<p>Rust Enums can do much more than act as a group of constants - we can also associate data with an Enum variant.</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Direction <span>{</span>
  Forward<span>,</span>
  Backward<span>,</span>

<p><span>This is a story of how the SAS rescued myself and two colleagues who were trapped in the British embassy in Tirana having been evacuated into the embassy on 12th September 12th 1998 as the country erupted into civil unrest and lawlessness. The boys from Hereford did good!</span></p>
<p>This was my first diplomatic posting and during the course of my career I took part in the <span>evacuation of British nationals&nbsp;(and others)</span><span>&nbsp;in a number of locations but on this occasion, I was the one being evacuated albeit from my residence to the embassy as a place of safety.<a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/libya-timely-evacuation-of-oil-workers/">Libya – Timely Evacuation Of Oil Workers During Arab Spring 2011</a></span></p>
<p>This was a day I was not going to forget in a hurry. I had just under four months left before my tour ended and I had spent the previous day at work trawling through future job opportunities. The Ambassador was again out of the country and the Deputy Head of Mission (DHM) was once more in charge. I should have known from previous experience and recent incidents that trouble always seemed to flare up when Ambassadors are away from post.</p>
<p>On this day, I awoke very early to the sounds of large explosions and the rattle of gunfire that seemed to be going off in all directions. What was going on? There had been no forewarning of trouble and things had been relatively quiet and stable in the city over the preceding weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to get hold of the DHM on my mobile phone but the network was down, always a bad sign. I immediately got on the embassy radio net and contacted her. She said that she had just heard from the German Embassy that a local high profile opposition politician, Azem Hajdari, had been assassinated outside the Parliament building and his Democratic Party (DP) supporters were on the warpath blaming the Socialist government party for the murder.</p>
<p>Tanks, automatic weapons and armoured personnel carriers had been seized by DP members and the government were now calling this an attempted coup d’etat and responding with armed force of its own.</p>
<p>She advised me to keep my head down, keep the radio close to hand and they would try and get an Embassy armoured vehicle to me as soon as possible and we would all rendezvous at the embassy. By this time, the noise of fighting outside seemed to be getting louder and getting nearer. The main government quarter was only just two blocks away from my apartment and it sounded like the main fighting was in this area. I cautiously pulled back a shutter and looked outside and saw there was a lot of smoke billowing forth from that quarter.</p>
<p>After about an hour, I heard a familiar voice on the radio, it was Benny our Embassy driver calling from the armoured car radio just outside my front gate. Not for the first time had he come to get me out of another messy situation. He advised me to be careful coming out as there was a body in front of my gate.</p>
<p>As I came out, the noise was deafening, there was small arms firing which appeared to be coming from the next street and there was indeed a man in what looked like a policeman’s uniform lying just to the side of my gate.</p>
<p>I didn’t hang around to assess his condition as just at that moment, a large group of armed men turned the corner on to my street firing in our direction as they advanced. Why they were shooting at a vehicle that was clearly marked as a diplomatic car, I had no idea. I jumped into the car and Benny quickly reversed the vehicle away from the onrushing crowd, turned it around at the intersection and off we sped to the embassy taking as many back roads as possible.</p>
<p>We reached the embassy safely but it was disturbing to see that the usual government provided armed security guarding the Embassy and the surrounds was nowhere to be seen. We drew up to the embassy and I ran into the building. Both the DHM and Management Officer (MO) were already there. The DHM had already contacted London and appraised them of the situation. It appeared that the violence was escalating and that it could very well be a coup d’etat. London advised us to remain in lockdown in the embassy and to stay there until further notice. Not very reassuring.</p>
<p>The hours went by, nighttime came and the sky was lit up with explosions and the gunfire seemed to be getting closer to the embassy. Throughout all of this, the DHM was updating London via our secure communication channels of our ever-growing precarious situation. They continued to advise us to stay in the embassy as help was on the way. What did that mean? How on earth were they going to help us? They were in London and we were trapped and bottled up at the sharp end.</p>
<p>Well, indeed help was on the way in the most unexpected form. After a long, restless and uncomfortable night trying to sleep on the floor of my office under my desk, as dawn was breaking, there was the sound of screeching tyres outside the embassy.</p>
<p>At first we thought this was it, the bad guys had arrived and we were destined for some form of uncertain captivity or worse, but no, out of two strange looking 4x4s, poured a section of heavily armed and equipped Special Air Service (SAS) troopers who had flown into Tirana airport from the UK in an RAF transport aircraft (without any flight clearance), offloaded themselves and sped the 17 Kms to the embassy.</p>
<p>There were no formalities, the SAS section commander immediately told the DHM that he was in charge and that we were to follow his instructions until further notice. For the time being, he said, there were no orders for evacuating us, his men would go out and evaluate the situation on the ground and then make a recommendation back to London.</p>
<p>They then set up their own communications suite in the Ambassador’s office (their communication specialist felt very much at home behind the large Ambassadorial desk), brought in their weapons and stores and after a short briefing, their patrol set off. Benny our driver volunteered to go with them and act as guide and interpreter if needed.</p>
<p>While one party was employed on this task another group made a start of setting up defensive positions within the embassy and thoroughly briefing us on what to do if we were subjected to an attack. It really was a boost to our morale that we had these guys now with us, more than able to physically protect us and if needed get us out of there to a place of safety if things deteriorated.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon the first patrol returned to the embassy. The good news was that they reported our homes had appeared from the outside not to have been looted. They said there was still heavy fighting going on in various parts of the city, but it seemed to be centred mainly around the government quarter. Benny told us later that the patrol had been menaced on several occasions by armed men, but a few well aimed shots above the heads of the mob had convinced them to melt away and not to mess with the patrol.</p>
<p>The fighting went on for about three days. Each day the sound of gunfire and explosions seemed to decrease. The SAS continued to send out rotating patrols to monitor the situation in and around the city, deciding after the third day that there was no need to evacuate us out of the country as their assessment was the fighting had run its course. Indeed thankfully, on the fourth day there was silence, no gunfire and no explosions.</p>
<p>The SAS kept us in the embassy for just over a week before they deemed it fully safe for us to return to our homes and resume normal work. We also received reassurances from the Albanian government that the fighting had now ceased, order had been restored and our local security would be reinstated. All of this was good news indeed.</p>
<p>However, it was a sad day when we came to bid farewell to our SAS rescuers as they packed up to leave. We had got to know them pretty well over the course of a long week. They were a thoroughly professional, no nonsense group of guys who were extremely sociable in the rare moments they took time out to relax in between patrols with a wealth of stories that kept us entertained during the long days and nights we were cooped up in the embassy.</p>
<p>I personally would miss their army ration packs on which we all lived, apart from rare welcome pizzas they brought back occasionally from goodness knows where by some of the patrols.</p>
<p>With impeccable timing, the day after they left, the Ambassador returned to post. Even he, not usually one to crack a joke at the best of times remarked tongue in cheek that in future he would give us ample warning of his next trip out of country so that we could be prepared for the next crisis. Not funny. Yes, by all means forewarn us of your next absence but make it far enough in advance so that I for one could also ensure I was not around as well!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-shadow-daemon:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">What is Shadow Daemon?</h2>

<p><em>Shadow Daemon</em> is a collection of tools to <em>detect</em>, <em>record</em>, and <em>block</em> <em>attacks</em> on <em>web applications</em>.
Technically speaking, Shadow Daemon is a <em>web application firewall</em> that intercepts requests and filters out malicious parameters.
It is a modular system that separates web application, analysis, and interface to increase security, flexibility, and expandability.</p>

<p>Shadow Daemon is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>. It is released under the license <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/about/license/">GPLv2</a>, so it is open source and the code can be examined, modified, and distributed by everyone.</p>

<h2 id="what-differentiates-shadow-daemon:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">What differentiates Shadow Daemon?</h2>

<h3 id="ease-of-use:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Ease of use</h3>

<p>Shadow Daemon is easy to install and can be managed with a clear and structured web interface that lets you examine attacks in great detail.</p>

<p>The interface also comes with shell scripts that can be used to send weekly reports via e-mail, rotate the logs, and the like.</p>




<h3 id="high-coverage:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">High coverage</h3>

<p>Shadow Daemon uses small connectors on application level to intercept requests.
This guarantees that the analyzed data is exactly the same as the input data of the web application, a task many firewalls fail to do properly.
The installation of the connectors is easy and does not require coding abilities.</p>

<p>At the moment the following programming languages, libs, and frameworks are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Perl

<ul>
<li>CGI</li>
<li>Mojolicious</li>
<li>Mojolicious::Lite</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Python

<ul>
<li>CGI</li>
<li>Django</li>
<li>Werkzeug</li>
<li>Flask</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional connectors are planned and will be released at some point in the future.
If you want to <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/development/contributing/">contribute</a> why not develop a new <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/documentation/connectors/">connector</a>?</p>

<h3 id="accurate-detection:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Accurate detection</h3>

<p>Shadow Daemon combines <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/documentation/blacklist/">blacklisting</a>, <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/documentation/whitelist/">whitelisting</a>, and <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/documentation/integrity/">integrity checking</a> to accurately detect malicious requests.
The blacklist makes use of sophisticated regular expressions to search for known attack patterns in the user input.
The whitelist on the other hand searches for irregularities in the user input based on strict rules that define how the input should look like.
The integrity check compares cryptographically secure checksums of the executed scripts against predefined values.</p>

<p>Together they can detect almost any attack on a web application and still have a very low false-positive rate.</p>

<p>Shadow Daemon is able to detect common attacks like:</p>

<ul>
<li>SQL injections</li>
<li>XML injections</li>
<li>Code injections</li>
<li>Command injections</li>
<li>Cross-site scripting</li>
<li>Local/remote file inclusions</li>
<li>Backdoor access</li>
<li>And more …</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="discreet-protection:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Discreet protection</h3>

<p>Unlike many other web application firewalls Shadow Daemon does not completely block malicious requests if possible.
Instead it only filters out the dangerous parts of a request and lets it proceed afterwards.
This makes attacks impossible, but does not unnecessary frustrate visitors in the case of false-positives.</p>

<h3 id="secure-architecture:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Secure architecture</h3>

<p>Shadow Daemon is closer to the application than most other web application firewalls.
It receives <em>exactly</em> the same input that the web application receives and thus it is almost impossible to bypass the detection by obfuscating the attack.
However, the most complex parts of Shadow Daemon are separated from the web application to guarantee a certain standard of security.</p>

<h2 id="who-should-use-shadow-daemon:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Who should use Shadow Daemon?</h2>

<p>Shadow Daemon is for people who want to run their own dynamic website without constantly having to worry about attacks and vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Shadow Daemon is for people who want to know if and how their website is attacked.</p>

<p>Shadow Daemon is for people who do not want to blindly place their trust in closed-source software that does its work in secret and costs a fortune.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-install-shadow-daemon:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">How do I install Shadow Daemon?</h2>

<p><em>Getting Started</em> contains everything you need to know. Start by reading <a href="https://shadowd.zecure.org/overview/shadowd/">shadowd</a>.
Installing Shadow Daemon is easy and only takes some minutes, really.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-follow-the-development-of-shadow-daemon:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">How can I follow the development of Shadow Daemon?</h2>

<p>The development of Shadow Daemon takes place at <a href="https://github.com/zecure">Github</a>.
Announcements are published via <a href="https://twitter.com/zecureit">Twitter</a>.

<h2 id="do-you-want-more-security:2767292a573dc549b9b4297b701af3ab">Do you want more security?</h2>

<p>Shadow Daemon is a passive security system.
It intercepts requests and tries to block attacks on your web applications.
If this is not enough for you and you want to actively find and fix vulnerabilities in your PHP and Java applications to reduce the attack surface to an absolute minimum you should check out the <em>source code analyser</em> <a href="https://www.ripstech.com/">RIPS</a>.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.ripstech.com/">RIPS</a> engine is armed with innovative code analysis algorithms that are specifically dedicated to the intricate features of the PHP and Java languages.
It is capable of analyzing modern applications for complex security vulnerabilities within minutes.
The full feature stack of both languages is supported, including object-oriented code, pitfall-prone security mechanisms, and built-in functions.
Security vulnerabilities are accurately detected by analyzing the data flow from user-controlled input parameters to sensitive operations in your application with 100% code coverage.</p>

    <time datetime="2017-05-08T00:00:00+00:00">May 08, 2017</time>
  </header>
<p>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903">recent paper</a> suggested a new mathematical
point of view on version control. I first found out about it from <code>pijul</code>,
a new version control system (VCS) that is loosely inspired by that paper. But
if you poke around the <code>pijul</code> <a href="https://pijul.com/">home page</a>, you won’t find
many details about what makes it different from existing VCSes. So I did a bit
of digging, and this series of blog posts is the result.</p>

<p>In the first part (i.e. this one), I’ll go over some of the theory developed in
the paper. In particular, I’ll describe a way to think about patches and
merging that is guaranteed to never, ever have a merge conflict. In the second
part, I’ll show how <code>pijul</code> puts that theory into action, and in the third part
I’ll dig into <code>pijul</code>’s implementation.</p>

<p>Before getting into some patch theory, a quick caveat: any real VCS needs to
deal with a lot of tedious details (directories, binary files, file renaming,
etc.). In order to get straight to the interesting new ideas, I’ll be skipping
all that. For the purposes of these posts, a VCS only needs to keep track of
a single file, which you should think of as a list of lines.</p>



<p>A patch is the difference between two files. Later in this series we’ll be
looking at some wild new ideas, so let’s start with something familiar and
comforting. The kind of patches we’ll discuss here go back to the early days of
Unix:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a patch works line-by-line (as opposed to, for example, word-by-word); and</li>
  <li>a patch can add new lines, but not modify existing lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to actually have a useful VCS, you need to be able to delete lines
also. But deleting lines turns out to add some complications, so we’ll deal
with them later.</p>

<p>For an example, let’s start with a simple file: my to-do list for this morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_1.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Looking back at the list, I realize that I forgot something important. Here’s the new one:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>To go from the original to-do list to the new one, I added the line with the
socks. In the format of the original Unix “diff” utility, the patch would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_3.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>The “1a2” line is a code saying that we’re going to add something after line 1 of the
input file, and the next bit is obviously telling us what to insert.</p>

<p>Since this blog isn’t a command line tool, we’ll represent patches with pretty diagrams
instead of flat files. Here’s how we’ll draw the patch above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_4.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Hopefully it’s self-explanatory, but just in case: an arrow goes from left to
right to indicate that the line on the right is the same as the one on the
left. Lines on the right with no arrow coming in are the ones that got added.
Since patches aren’t allowed to re-order the lines, the lines are guaranteed
not to cross.</p>

<p>There’s something implicit in our notation that really needs to be said out
loud: for us, <b>a patch is tied to a specific input file</b>. This is the first point
where we diverge from the classic Unix ways: the classic Unix patch that we
produced using “diff” could in principle be applied to <em>any</em> input file, and it
would still insert “* put on socks” after the first line. In many cases that
wouldn’t be what you want, but sometimes it is.</p>



<p>The best thing about patches is that they can enable multiple people to edit
the same file and then merge their changes afterwards. Let’s suppose that my
wife also decides to put things on my to-do list: she
takes the original file and adds a line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_5.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now there are two new versions of my to-do list: mine with the socks, and my
wife’s with the garbage. Let’s draw them all together:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_6.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This brings us to merging: since I’d prefer to have my to-do list as a single
file, I want to merge my wife’s changes and my own. In this example, it’s
pretty obvious what the result should be, but let’s look at the general problem
of merging. We’ll do this slowly and carefully, and our endpoint might be
different from what you’re used to.</p>

<h2 id="patch-composition">Patch composition</h2>

<p>First, I need to introduce some notation for an obvious concept: the
<em>composition</em> of two patches is the patch that you would get by applying one
patch and then applying the other. Since a “patch” for us also includes the
original file, you can’t just compose any two old patches. If <code>p</code> is a patch
taking the file <code>O</code> to the file <code>A</code> and <code>r</code> is a patch taking <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>, then
you can compose the two (but only in one order!) to obtain a patch from <code>O</code> to
<code>B</code>. I’ll write this composition as <code>pr</code>: first apply <code>p</code>, then <code>r</code>.</p>

<p>It’s pretty easy to visualize patch composition using our diagrams: to compute
the composition of two paths, just “follow the arrows”</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_7.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>to get the (dotted red) patch going from <code>O</code> to <code>B</code>.</p>

<h2 id="merging-as-composition">Merging as composition</h2>

<p>I’m going to define carefully what a merge is in terms of patch composition.
I’ll do this in a very math-professor kind of way: I’ll give a precise
definition, followed by some examples, and only afterwards will I explain
why the definition makes sense.
So here’s the definition: if <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> are two different patches
taking the file <code>O</code> to the files <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively, a <em>merge</em> of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
is a pair of patches <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> such that</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>r</code> and <code>s</code> take <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively to a common output file <code>M</code>, and</li>
  <li><code>pr = qs</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can illustrate this definition with a simple diagram, where the capital
letters denote files, and the lower-case letters are patches going between
them:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_8.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Instead of saying that <code>pr = qs</code>, a mathematician (or anyone who wants
to sound fancy) would say that the diagram above <em>commutes</em>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_9.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And here is an example of something that is not a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_10.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This is not a merge because it fails the condition <code>pr = qs</code>: composing the
patches along the top path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_11.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>but composing them along the bottom path gives</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_12.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Specifically, the two patches disagree on which of the shoes in the final list
came from the original file. This is the real meaning underlying the condition
<code>pr = qs</code>: it means that there will never be any ambiguity about which lines
came from where. If you’re used to using <code>blame</code> or <code>annotate</code> commands with
your favorite VCS, you can probably imagine why this sort of ambiguity would be
bad.</p>

<h2 id="a-historical-note">A historical note</h2>

<p>Merging patches is an old idea, of course, and so I just want to briefly
explain how the presentation above differs from “traditional” merging:
traditionally, merging was defined by algorithms (of which there are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)#Merge_algorithms">many</a>). These algorithms would try to automatically find a good merge; if
they couldn’t, you would be asked to supply one instead.</p>

<p>We’ll take a different approach: instead of starting with an algorithm, we’ll
start with a list of properties that we want a good merge to satisfy. At the end,
we’ll find that there’s a unique merge that satisfies all these properties
(and fortunately for us, there will also be an efficient algorithm to find it).</p>



<p>The main problem with merges is that they aren’t unique. This isn’t a huge
problem by itself: lots of great things aren’t unique. The problem is that we
usually want to merge automatically, and an automatic system needs an
unambiguous answer. Eventually, we’ll deal with this by defining a special
class of merges (called perfect merges) which will be unique. Before that,
we’ll explore the problem with some examples.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with a silly example, in which our merge tool decides to
add some extra nonsense:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_13.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>No sane merge tool would ever do that, of course, but it’s still a valid
merge according to our rule in the last section. Clearly, we’ll have
to tighten up the rules to exclude this case.</p>

<h2 id="a-serious-example">A serious example</h2>

<p>Here is a more difficult situation with two merges that are actually
reasonable:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_14.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Both of these merges are valid according to our rules above, but you need to
actually know what the lines <em>mean</em> in order to decide that the first merge is
better (especially if it’s raining outside). Any reasonable automatic merging
tool would refuse to choose, instead requiring its user to do the merge
manually.</p>

<p>The examples above are pretty simple, but how would you decide in general
whether a merge is unambiguous and can be performed automatically? In existing
tools, the details depend on the merging algorithm. Since we started off with
a non-algorithmic approach, let’s see where that leads: instead of specifying
explicitly which merges we can do, we’ll describe the properties that an ideal
merge should have.</p>



<p>The main idea behind the
definition I’m about to give is that it will never cause any regrets. That is,
no matter what happens in the future, we can always represent the history just
as well through the merge as we could using the original branches. Obviously,
that’s a nice property to have; personally, I think it’s non-obvious why it’s
a good choice as the <em>defining</em> property of the ideal merge, but we’ll get to
that later.</p>

<p>Ok, here it comes. Consider a merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_15.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>And now suppose that the original creators of patches <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>
continued working on their own personal branches, which merged sometime in
the future at the file <code>F</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_16.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>We say that the merge <code>(r, s)</code> is a <em>perfect merge</em> if for <em>every</em> possible
choice of the merge <code>(u, v)</code>, there is a unique patch <code>w</code> so that <code>u = rw</code>
and <code>v = sw</code>. (In math terms, the diagram commutes.)
We’re going to call <code>w</code> a <em>continuation</em>, since it tells us how to continue
working from the merged file. To repeat, a merge is perfect if for every
possible future, there is a unique continuation.</p>

<h2 id="a-perfect-merge">A perfect merge</h2>

<p>Let’s do a few examples to explore the various corners of our definition.
First, an example of a perfect merge:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_17.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>It takes a bit of effort to actually <em>prove</em> that this is a perfect merge;
I’ll leave that as an exercise. It’s more interesting to see some examples
that fail to be perfect.</p>

<h2 id="a-silly-example-1">A silly example</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the silly example of a merge that introduced an unnecessary
line:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_18.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>This turns out (surprise, surprise) not to be a perfect merge.
To understand how our definition of merge perfection excludes merges like this,
here is an example of a possible future without a continuation:</p>

<p><img src="https://jneem.github.io/images/merge_tikz_block_19.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Since our patches can’t delete lines, there’s no way to get from <code>merged</code>
to <code>future</code>.</p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-07-12</p>
        
<p>Let's start by talking about scientific literacy. I'm going to use a weak definition of scientific literacy, one that simply requires familiarity with the Baconian method of inquiry.</p>
<p>I don't want to place an exact number on this issue, but I'd wager the vast majority of the population of "educated" countries scientifically illiterate.</p>
<h2>I - The gravity of the issue</h2>
<p>I first got a hint that this could be a real issue when I randomly started asking people about the theory of gravity. I find gravity to be interesting because it's not at all obvious. I don't think any of us would have been able to come up with the concept in Newton's shoes. Yet it is taught to people fairly early in school.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I found that most people were not only unaware of how Newton came up with the idea of gravity, but not even in the right ballpark. I think I can classify the mistakes made into three categories, which I'll illustrate with an answer each:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>Science as Religion</strong> mistake: Something something, he saw apples falling towards earth, and then he wrote down the formula for gravity (?)</li>
<li>The <strong>Aristotelian Science</strong> mistake: Well, he observed that objects of different mass fell towards Earth with the same speed, and from that he derived that objects attract each other. Ahm, wait, hmmm.</li>
<li>The <strong>Lack of information</strong> mistake: Well, he observed something about the motion of the planets and the moon... and, presumably he estimated the mass of some, or, hmmm, no that can't be right, maybe he just assumed mass_sun &gt;&gt; mass_plant &gt;&gt; mass_moon and somehow he found that his formula accounted for the motion of the planets.</li>
</ol>
<p>I should caveat this by saying I don't count mistake nr 3 as scientific illiteracy, in this case, I think most of us fall in that category most of the time. Ask me how gravity can be derived in principle and I might be able to make an educated guess and maybe (once the observations are in) I could even derive it. But the chances of that are small, I probably wouldn't know the exact information I'd need which can be measured with 17th-century devices. I most certainly don't have the information readily sitting in my brain.</p>
<p>It's mainly failure modes 1 and 2 that I'm interested in here.</p>
<h2>II - And Science said: Let there be truth</h2>
<p>I think failure mode 1 is best illustrated by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+newton+discovered+gravity">first youtube result</a> if you search for "how newton discovered gravity". This failure mode includes two mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not understanding the basis of the actual theory (in this case 'gravity' is presented as "objects fall towards Earth", rather than objects attracting each other proportional to their mass and distance).</li>
<li>Not understanding the idea of evidence as a generator of theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this failure, mode science works more or less like religion. There's a clergy (researchers, teachers, engineers) and there are various holy texts (school manuals, papers, specialized books).</p>
<p>I think a good indication of this failure mode is that people stuck here don't seem to differentiate between "what other humans in authority positions are saying" versus "what we observe in the world" as having fundamentally different epistemic weight.</p>
<p>Good examples here are e.g. young-earth creationists, people the believe the earth was created ~6000 years ago. Most of these kinds of people are obviously not scientists, but some are, a quick google search brings up Duane Gish (Berkely P.hD) and Kurt Wise (professor at a no-name university in Georgia).</p>
<p>However, young-earth creationism is not the only unscientific belief system people have, there are insane conspiracy theories aplenty, from vaccines being brainwashing mechanisms or 5G causing viral infections.</p>
<p>This kind of insanity is usually not represented in people affiliated with scientific or engineer institutions, but I'm unsure it is for the right reasons.</p>
<p>That is to say, assume you think of science as a religion. Your epistemology is based on what other people tell you, you weigh that by their social rank and thus derive what you hold as "truth".</p>
<p>Assume you are a doctor that falls into this category and 70% of your friends tell you "5G towers cause covid-19". Well, then, you could probably start believing that yourself. <em>But</em> keep in mind, it's not the only number of people that matters, the status also matters. If the priest tells you about the word of God that counts 100x as much as the village idiot telling you about the word of God.</p>
<p>Even with this context, if our good doctor's boss tells him "covid-19 infection is caused by an airborne coronavirus that passes from human to human via various bodily fluids dispersed in the air and on objects", then whatever this boss told him would have enough status magnitude to make him set his opinion on the more scientifically correct explanation.</p>
<p>The problem here is that our good doctor would be unable to come up with this explanation on his own, even in a hypothetical, he lacks even the foundational epistemology required to understand how such answers can be derived.</p>
<p>Even worst, our doctor's boos could share his epistemology, all that would be needed is for her boos to have told her the same thing and she would have believed it in an instant.</p>
<p>This Science as a Religion worldview is likely sprinkled through all engineers and scientists. The reason we don't see it is that for it to become obvious, one needs to start believing an obviously insane thing (e.g. young-earth creationism), however, the chance of this happening is fairly low since it would require all their peers to also believe insane things.</p>
<p>As long as "correct" ideas are observed throughout his professional environment, unless he is socially inept, he will only hold the correct idea.</p>
<p>You would need to look at his research or question him on the scientific method or on his epistemology more broadly in order to spot this mistake. Sadly enough, I've yet to find a university that has "scientific epistemology" as a subject on the entrance exam or even as a graduation or employment requirement.</p>
<p>I won't speculate as to how many people who are called scientists and engineers fall into this failure mode. I think there's a gradient between this and failure mode nr 2.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that this failure mode is unobvious <strong>until</strong> a new idea comes along. Then, the real scientists will assume it's probably false but judge it on its merit. The religious scientists will assume it's false because their peers haven't said it's right yet.</p>
<p>This is both an issue in regards to new ideas proliferating and an issue with the scientific consensus. Scientific consensus is valuable if you assume everyone pooled reasoned their way through theory, independent research, and primary source dissection to reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>In a world where 90% of scientists just assume that science works like a religion, a 96%-4% consensus is not a good indicator for implementing policy, it's an indicator that the few real scientists are almost evenly split on the correct solution.</p>
<p>This is bleak stuff, if most scientists were understanding science as a religion then the whole institution would be compromised. Not only would academia have to be thrown in the bin, but all evidence and theory produced for the last half-century would have to be carefully curated and replicated before it can be considered scientifically true.</p>
<p>Surface level intuitions want me to think there's a significant probability this might be the case with certain sub-fields. But my theory of mind and the fact that science seems to keep progressing tells me this is unlikely to be the case in relevant areas.</p>
<h2>III - If there's a fit there's a way</h2>
<p>In short, these are the people that don't understand why a regression being fit on all the data is different from using the same regression to determine correlation strength via cross-validation.</p>
<p>I think most people and most scientists probably fall under the second failure mode, they are not Baconians or Popperians, but rather they are Aristotelians.</p>
<p>Aristotle understood the idea that we can observe the world and we can come up with theories about how it works based on observation.</p>
<p>He lacked was a rigorous understanding of how observations should be undertaken. He was probably unaware of the idea of having similar experimental error standards and replications as the rules by which the validity of data can be compared.</p>
<p>He lacked an understanding of the language of probability which would allow him to formulate these experimental standards.</p>
<p>He lacked an understanding of falsifiability and Occam's razor, he didn't have a rigorous system for comparing competing theories.</p>
<p>In an Aristotelian framework, dropping 3 very heavy and well-lackered balls towards Earth and seeing they fall with a constant speed barring any wind is enough to say <code>FG = G * m1 * m2 / r^2</code> is a true scientific theory.</p>
<p>If things like the constant <code>G</code> and the mass of the ball and the radius of the earth are already known, then the Aristotelian has no issue with declaring the theory correct. He needn't ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you assume this holds for all objects? After all, the only thing we have observed is three objects falling towards Earth. Even more, the balls are too light to observe this effect between them.</li>
<li>Why can this equation not be simpler? I could simplify this equation to only a single term if what you wished to describe is just the fall of objects towards the Earth, which is the only thing your experiment is showing anyway.</li>
<li>Why is dropping 3 balls enough to derive anything? Why are 2 not enough, why aren't 100 needed? Also, why is weight the property in question here and not some other property of the ball? Maybe it works for lead balls but not for copper balls?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will grant I might be straw-manning Aristotle here, he would have been able to ask some of those questions, he just didn't have a rigorous frameworks from which to derive them. He was working from Aristotelian logic and intuition.</p>
<p>This seems to be the kind of failure that most people fall into, and why …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Today’s developers are expected to develop resilient and scalable 
distributed systems. Systems that are easy to patch in the face of 
security concerns and easy to do low-risk incremental upgrades. Systems 
that benefit from software reuse and innovation of the open source 
model. Achieving all of this for different languages, using a variety of
 application frameworks with embedded libraries is not possible.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/multi-runtime-microservice-architecture/" rel="external" target="_blank">blogged</a>
 about “Multi-Runtime Microservices Architecture” where I have explored 
the needs of distributed systems such as lifecycle management, advanced 
networking, resource binding, state abstraction and how these 
abstractions have been changing over the years. I also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZPEIJFJV9k" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spoke</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;“The
 Evolution of Distributed Systems on Kubernetes” covering how Kubernetes
 Operators and the sidecar model are acting as the primary innovation 
mechanisms for delivering the same distributed system primitives.</p>
<p>On both occasions, the main takeaway is the prediction that the 
progression of software application architectures on Kubernetes moves 
towards the sidecar model managed by operators. Sidecars and operators 
could become a mainstream software distribution and consumption model 
and in some cases even replace software libraries and frameworks as we 
are used to.</p>
<p>The sidecar model allows the composition of applications written in 
different languages to deliver joint value, faster and without the 
runtime coupling. Let’s see a few concrete examples of sidecars and 
operators, and then we will explore how this new software composition 
paradigm could impact us.</p>
<h2>Out-of-Process Smarts on the Rise</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes, a sidecar is one of the <a href="http://k8spatterns.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">core design patterns</a>
 achieved easily by organizing multiple containers in a single Pod. The 
Pod construct ensures that the containers are always placed on the same 
node and can cooperate by interacting over networking, file system or 
other IPC methods. And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/" rel="external" target="_blank">operators</a>
 allow the automation, management and integration of the sidecars with 
the rest of the platform. The sidecars represent a language-agnostic, 
scalable data plane offering distributed primitives to custom 
applications. And the operators represent their centralized management 
and control plane.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few popular manifestations of the sidecar model.</p>
<h3>Envoy</h3>
<p>Service Meshes such as Istio, Consul, and others are using transparent service proxies such as <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Envoy</a>
 for delivering enhanced networking capabilities for distributed 
systems. Envoy can improve security, it enables advanced traffic 
management, improves resilience, adds deep monitoring and tracing 
features. Not only that, it understands more and more Layer 7 protocols 
such as Redis, MongoDB, MySQL and most recently Kafka. It also added 
response caching capabilities and even WebAssembly support that will 
enable all kinds of custom plugins. Envoy is an example of how a 
transparent service proxy adds advanced networking capabilities to a 
distributed system without including them into the runtime of the 
distributed application components.</p>
<h3>Skupper</h3>
<p>In addition to the typical service mesh, there are also projects, such as<a href="https://skupper.io/" rel="external" target="_blank"> Skupper</a>,
 that ship application networking capabilities through an external 
agent. Skupper solves multicluster Kubernetes communication challenges 
through a Layer 7 virtual network and offers advanced routing and 
connectivity capabilities. But rather than embedding Skupper into the 
business service runtime, it runs an instance per Kubernetes namespace 
which acts as a shared sidecar.</p>
<h3>Cloudstate</h3>
<p><a href="https://cloudstate.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Cloudstate</a>
 is another example of the sidecar model, but this time for providing 
stateful abstractions for the serverless development model. It offers 
stateful primitives over GRPC for EventSourcing, CQRS, Pub/Sub, 
Key/Value stores and other use cases. Again, it an example of sidecars 
and operators in action but this time for the serverless programming 
model.</p>
<h3>Dapr</h3>
<p><a href="https://dapr.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Dapr</a>
 is a relatively young project started by Microsoft, and it is also 
using the sidecar model for providing developer-focused distributed 
system primitives. Dapr offers abstractions for state management, 
service invocation and fault handling, resource bindings, pub/sub, 
distributed tracing and others. Even though there is some overlap in the
 capabilities provided by Dapr and Service Mesh, both are very different
 in nature. Envoy with Istio is injected and runs transparently from the
 service and represents an operational tool. Dapr, on the other hand, 
has to be called explicitly from the application runtime over HTTP or 
gRPC and it is an explicit sidecar targeted for developers. It is a 
library for distributed primitives that is distributed and consumed as a
 sidecar, a model that may become very attractive for developers 
consuming distributed capabilities.</p>
<h3>Camel K</h3>
<p>Apache Camel is a mature integration library that rediscovers itself on Kubernetes. Its subproject <a href="https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Camel K</a>
 uses heavily the operator model to improve the developer experience and
 integrate deeply with the Kubernetes platform. While Camel K does not 
rely on a sidecar, through its CLI and operator it is able to reuse the 
same application container and execute any local code modification in a 
remote Kubernetes cluster in less than a second. This is another example
 of developer-targeted software consumption through the operator model.</p>
<h2>More to Come</h2>
<p>And these are only some of the pioneer projects exploring various 
approaches through sidecars and operators. There is more work being done
 to reduce the networking overhead introduced by container-based 
distributed architectures such as the data plane development kit (<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">DPDK</a>),
 which is a userspace application that bypasses the layers of the Linux 
kernel networking stack and access directly to the network hardware. 
There is work in the Kubernetes project to create <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753" rel="external" target="_blank">sidecar</a> containers with more granular lifecycle guarantees. There are new Java projects based on GraalVM implementation such as <a href="https://quarkus.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">Quarkus</a>
 that reduce the resource consumption and application startup time which
 makes more workloads attractive for sidecars. All of these innovations 
will make the side-car model more attractive and enable the creation of 
even more such projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/d/multiruntine1.png"><img alt="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" data-original-height="944" data-original-width="1670" height="226" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ajKfxQnN7Eg/Xs1961D9WzI/AAAAAAAAORs/_hu-KhmUN1wsQ8PfeIaNKaHNVyi8-3iYACK4BGAsYHg/w400-h226/multiruntine1.png" title="Sidecars Providing Distributed Systems Primitives" width="400"></a></p><p>Sidecars providing distributed systems primitives</p>
<p>I’d not be surprised to see projects coming up around more specific 
use cases such as stateful orchestration of long-running processes such 
as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) engines in sidecars. Job 
schedulers in sidecars. Stateless integration engines i.e. Enterprise 
Integration Patterns implementations in sidecars. Data abstractions and 
data <a href="https://github.com/teiid/teiid-operator" rel="external" target="_blank">federation</a> engines in sidecars. OAuth2/<a href="https://github.com/louketo/louketo-proxy" rel="external" target="_blank">OpenID</a>
 proxy in sidecars. Scalable database connection pools for serverless 
workloads in sidecars. Application networks as sidecars, etc. But why 
would software vendors and developers switch to this model? Let’s see a 
few of the benefits it provides.</p>
<h2>Runtimes with Control Planes over Libraries</h2>
<p>If you are a software vendor today, probably you have already 
considered offering your software to potential users as an API or a 
SaaS-based solution. This is the fastest software consumption model and a
 no-brainer to offer, when possible. Depending on the nature of the 
software you may be also distributing your software as a library or a 
runtime framework. Maybe it is time to consider if it can be offered as a
 container with an operator too. This mechanism of distributing software
 and the resulting architecture has some very unique benefits that the 
library mechanism cannot offer.</p>
<h3>Supporting Polyglot Consumers</h3>
<p>By offering libraries to be consumable through open protocols and 
standards, you open them up for all programming languages. A library 
that runs as a sidecar and consumable over HTTP, using a text format 
such as JSON does not require any specific client runtime library. Even 
when gRPC and Protobuf are used for low-latency and high-performance 
interactions, it is still easier to generate such clients than including
 third party custom libraries in the application runtime and implement 
certain interfaces.</p>
<h3>Application Architecture Agnostic</h3>
<p>The explicit sidecar architecture (as opposed to the transparent one)
 is a way of software capability consumption as a separate runtime 
behind a developer-focused API. It is an orthogonal feature that can be 
added to any application whether that is monolithic, microservices, 
functions-based, actor-based or anything in between. It can sit next to a
 monolith in a less dynamic environment, or next to every microservice 
in a dynamic cloud-based environment. It is trivial to create sidecars 
on Kubernetes, and doable on many other software orchestration platforms
 too.</p>
<h3>Tolerant to Release Impedance Mismatch</h3>
<p>Business logic is always custom and developed in house. Distributed 
system primitives are well-known commodity features, and consumed 
off-the-shelf as either platform features or runtime libraries. You 
might be consuming software for state abstractions, messaging clients, 
networking resiliency and monitoring libraries, etc. from third-party 
open source projects or companies. And these third party entities have 
their release cycles, critical fixes, CVE patches that impact your 
software release cycles too. When third party libraries are consumed as a
 separate runtime (sidecar), the upgrade process is simpler as it is 
behind an API and it is not coupled with your application runtime. The 
release impedance mismatch between your team and the consumed 3rd party 
libraries vendors becomes easier to manage.</p>
<h3>Control Plane Included Mentality</h3>
<p>When a feature is consumed as a library, it is included in your 
application runtime and it becomes your responsibility to understand how
 it works, how to configure, monitor, tune and upgrade. That is because 
the language runtimes (such as the JVM) and the runtime frameworks (such
 as Spring Boot or application servers) dictate how a third-party 
library can be included, …</p></div></div>

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: [PHP-DEV] Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows</p>
<p>My name is Dale Hirt and I am the project manager for PHP inside Microsoft. <br>
We are not, however, going to be supporting PHP for Windows in any capacity for version 8.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>Hi Dale! <br>
First, let me convey all our appreciation for the work Microsoft has put into supporting PHP on Windows over the years.  Thank you also for letting us know in advance to not expect 8.0 builds.  I guess this decision must have only been made very recently since 8.0.0alpha1 and alpha2 builds were produced already.</p>
<p>I won't say I'm not bummed, of course.  Nevertheless, y'all gotta do what you gotta do.  I'm sure we can work out an alternative by the end of the year.</p>
<p>All the best, <br>

But to the onlooker, they clearly stand apart.&nbsp;</p>    <p>In the latest episode of <em>More&nbsp;with Anna Maria Tremonti</em>, it also becomes clear that Gehry sees his buildings as a way to bring people together,&nbsp;and sees his own role in life as much more than an architect. In a wide-sweeping conversation, he traces his craft back to the days when his grandmother would encourage him to build cities out of&nbsp;wood blocks&nbsp;for the fire — an act of imagination he's adapted for&nbsp;students of today.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em>The following excerpt from their conversation has been condensed for length and clarity. Find the full interview here or on your favourite podcast app.</em></p>  <p><strong>As I listen to you I hear that you are so much more than an architect. That you care&nbsp;about more than the building of buildings.</strong></p>  <p>I do, yeah. Well I grew up that way.</p>  <p>You know my grandfather used to read Talmud to me. I don't think he was&nbsp;sellout religious. He was just interested in the philosophy. And Talmud starts with the word "Why." It's about curiosity. And I think that is really important. You've got to be curious.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Buildings are backgrounds for activity but the activity has to be&nbsp;a life, a thing. It's got to be more than just making money. It's a cultural thing and it brings people together to talk to each other, live together, work together. So, just the building alone is not that relevant.</p>  <p><strong>Do you think that most architects understand that? Most people?</strong></p>  <p>Not most.&nbsp;I don't think so.</p>  <p>Although architects tend to be idealists. They start out very idealistic. They want to make the world better. Most of the architects I know and work with have an idealistic base. They're trying to make a better world.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/frank-gehry.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/frank-gehry.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/frank-gehry.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/frank-gehry.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/frank-gehry.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5491455.1583782068!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/frank-gehry.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>People pass in front of the Frank Gehry designed Guggenheim Museum at dusk in Bilbao.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How important was your family life in creating the man who you are today? Those early days when you were a kid.</strong></p>  <p>Okay, so now you're gonna make me cry. Well my grandparents were great. My grandmother brought the wood blocks home for the fire, for the wood stove. And she would throw them on the floor and make cities with me.</p>    <p>And I don't know why she decided to do that. Architecture wasn't in any part of our family at that time. So that was an&nbsp;important memory.</p>  <p>My father was not educated at all. He probably didn't even go to school. He was living on the streets in New York — Tenth Avenue. His father was a tailor who came from Russia and is actually buried in Toronto. And his name was Frank Goldberg. So there is a Frank Goldberg buried in a cemetery in Toronto — that's my grandfather.</p>  <p>Anyway, so my father ...&nbsp;had a heart attack at 49. He lost everything. And his brother moved him to L.A.</p>  <p>We got here and we were very poor because he had lost everything. But he became a truck driver and I became a truck driver. I was 17 or 18. Now, after he's gone — he died at 63 or something like that — I've seen evidence now that I find in some of the things he left behind, that we never looked at really until recently, and it's pretty clear that he had an artistic bent and that that's what he liked doing.</p>  <p>He would paint toys for people. He would make things.&nbsp;I remember him drawing with me but he never got to see what I started to do. By time I was an architect, he was out of it.</p>  <p><strong>What do you think you would have thought of your work? Would he have been proud of you?</strong></p>  <p>He would be shocked and proud. I think, yeah. I liked that thought.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>So, what advice do you give to your son as he tries to carve his own path?</strong></p>  <p>Just stay curious. Do where your head takes you. And be conscious of the people who are working with you and the people who are you're working for and the importance of what you do in relation to your contribution to what's going on around us.</p>  <p><strong>That sounds like advice you could give to lots of people.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. Well, I'm not holier than thou about it.&nbsp;I know that I just live that way. But there's a lot of different ways to live and still be creative and still be part of the world and still be doing important things. So my way is not the only example.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Well, I think in these times though it's nice to hear you know to connect the work you do and the wider concept of architecture to the idea of humanity and being humane.</strong> <strong>I think it's a really important thing to hear from you.</strong></p>  <p>Yeah. But I think the history of architecture shows that that was prevalent from the beginning.</p>  <p>You know all the great artists of the Renaissance became architects. So Giotto was a great painter, became an architect. El Greco was a great painter, became an architect. Architecture was treated as an art in those times.</p>    <p>After the war here architecture became less of an art and more&nbsp;engineering issues and financial issues. And not that they're not important but that became the driver. Not the humanity of it. And that's why our cities are kind of the way they are I think. And the cities look the same all over the world. You go to Seoul, Korea. It looks like downtown L.A.</p>  <p><strong>Do you see yourself as an artist more than an architect?</strong></p>  <p>Absolutely. I hope so.&nbsp;I think it's the same. They're not mutually exclusive. When I got out of school, I hung out with the artists more than with the architects because I just felt that's where I should be. And I still do.</p>    <div>   <h2>Want to hear the full conversation?</h2>   <p>Listen for free at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/more-with-anna-maria-tremonti/index.html">cbc.ca/more</a>&nbsp;or on your favourite podcast app — including&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/more-with-anna-maria-tremonti/id1494930679">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL3BvZGNhc3RpbmcvaW5jbHVkZXMvbW9yZS54bWw%3D">Google Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/17PsCUS5j6WN1GiqBGDIxn">Spotify</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>After reading an article from <em>Psychology Today <span>by Hal Herzog,</span></em> it got me thinking about the idea of pet-keeping.&nbsp;The article&nbsp;“<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animals-and-us/201006/are-humans-the-only-animals-keep-pets"><em>Are Humans The Only Animals That Keep Pets?</em></a>“, claims that humans are the only animal that keeps members of other species for an extended point of time purely for enjoyment. Herzog points out that while&nbsp;some animals are documented having pets, this behavior almost always happen in captive or semi-captive environment where food and shelter are provided.&nbsp;The author believes that humans are “true” pet owners because the owner-pet relationship occurs in a natural setting and argues that animal pet owners are not “true” pet owners because they do so in captive or semi-captive settings. Thus, Herzog believes that humans are the only animals that keep pets.</p>
<p>Cited in the article is a paper by Izar et al. (2006), on cross-genus adoption of a marmoset by wild capuchin monkeys (link to the paper is below on References). While the paper specifically refers to the behavior as an adoption, Herzog and paper co-author Dorothy Fragaszy think that there is a parallel between the capuchin-marmoset adoption and pet-keeping in humans. However, these capuchins live in a site where food are provided daily. So,&nbsp;Despite the similarities,&nbsp;these capuchins are not “true” pet owners&nbsp;according to Herzog’s definition of pet-keeping,</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Hbo7Ung0Hbg/TC1ORXYQLXI/AAAAAAAABX8/VTgk4NGKO4I/s1600/capuchin+marmoset.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_Hbo7Ung0Hbg/TC1ORXYQLXI/AAAAAAAABX8/VTgk4NGKO4I/s320/capuchin+marmoset.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="320"></a></p>
<p>A young marmoset taking food (cracked palm nut) from its adoptive mother’s (capuchin) hand. Photo&nbsp;by Jeanne Shirley (Izar et al., 2006).</p>
<p>What is a pet and how would you define one? Herzog (2010) defines a pet as a member of other species that are being kept for an extended period of time for enjoyment. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of a pet is “a domesticated animal kept for pleasure rather than utility”. The definition of a pet in Oxford English Dictionary is “a domestic or tamed animal or bird kept for companionship or pleasure and treated with care and affection”.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vet.upenn.edu/FacultyandDepartments/Faculty/tabid/362/Default.aspx?faculty_id=6361798">Dr. James Serpell</a> defines pet-keeping as a leisure activity but not necessarily without function, much like there are function in play or other recreational pursuits (Serpell, 1990). He thinks that pet-keeping is functional in a broad sense but not easily evaluable in economic terms.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Hbo7Ung0Hbg/TC0T9RLNqeI/AAAAAAAABX4/ou8MLJEVT30/s1600/great+ape_cats.jpg"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_Hbo7Ung0Hbg/TC0T9RLNqeI/AAAAAAAABX4/ou8MLJEVT30/s320/great+ape_cats.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="153"></a></p>
<div>
<p>Some primate pet owners include (left)&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)">Koko</a> and (right)&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonda_(orangutan)">Tonda</a>,&nbsp;who both had cats as pets.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to define what a pet is from an animal standpoint, at least in humans, we can agree that a pet can be defined as a companion animal that we treat with affection whose function is to provide us with&nbsp;enjoyment.</p>
<p>Did the behavior of animal domestication evolved into pet-keeping? Is pet-keeping a reflection of human’s nurturing instinct? Or is pet-keeping a reflection of human’s constant need of social interaction, even outside of our own species? What do you think? Well … that’s for another blog post.</p>

  <p>Containers need to communicate with each other and outside world.<br>
Docker has wide network capabilities.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker network? How to use it?</p>

<p>What elements we have in docker network?</p>
<ul>
<li>CNM</li>
<li>libnetwork</li>
<li>drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker network concept is based on open-source design specification called Container Network Model(CNM). CNM assume that network drivers should be pluggable.<br>
Docker CNM implementation is in <code>libnetwork</code> library.</p>
<p>What we can do with docker CNM?</p>
<ul>
<li>single-host bridges</li>
<li>multi-host overlay networks</li>
<li>networks plugged into VLAN’s</li>
<li>ingress networks with load balancing
Also we get auto service discovery for our containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>What elements we have in docker CNM implementation?</p>
<ul>
<li>sandboxes - container network stack - isolated - ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables and DNS config</li>
<li>endpoint - virtual interfaces in containers - veth</li>
<li>networks - virtual switches(bridges) - connect endpoints</li>
</ul>
<p>What drivers are built-in by default into docker(Linux)?</p>
<ul>
<li>bridge</li>
<li>overlay</li>
<li>macvlan</li>
</ul>

<p>By default docker creates one brigde after instalation.</p>
<p>All containers are by default connected to it unless we override it.<br>
To set another non-default network we use <code>--network</code> flag for <code>docker run</code>.</p>
<p>What is the diference between default bridge and user created one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default brigde is less secure - provide less isolation - by default all containers will be connected to it</li>
<li>We can connect/disconnect containers from user defined bridges without restarting containers</li>
<li>Defualt bridge does not have DNS included - we must use IP in such network - on user defined bridge we get DNS(all containers added to bridge network automatically will be added also to DNS) - just connect container to bridge and you can talk with other containers in network by their names(works for named containers with <code>--name</code> at creation time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that all default networks are local - what means that we can’t connect with them containers on multiple docker hosts.</p>

<p>Docker gives us possibility to integrate container network stack into host stack.<br>
In such situation container will not get his own IP address and MAC(neither externally from docker host network, neither internally from network created by docker engine) - he will be reachable as he will be normal software running on our host.</p>
<p>This is good solution if we want to run some software that use network but we want to have full isolation of process(pid), mount(mnt), user and IPC namespaces.</p>
<p>To active such mode we use <code>--network=host</code> parameter to <code>docker run</code>.<br>
In this mode <code>--publish</code> doesn’t work - if service in container listen on port 80 - port 80 on docker host will be taken.</p>

<p>If we want to expose our container to world but it is important for us that container has got own IP and MAC adress from network where docker host is connected, we can use MACVLAN network driver. It allows also to connect to certain VLAN.</p>
<p>It will create for us docker network - all containers connected to this network will be visible in docker host network as they were normal separate from docker host that host them machines.</p>
<p>Remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>with MACVLAN you can easily exhaust IP adresses in your network</li>

<p><strong>Mark Sherman</strong>
<br>
<em>Carnegie Mellon University</em></p>
<p>
Today’s software is largely assembled rather than written, and most of the assembly comes from open source components. The creation of components and their inclusion into applications creates a “supply chain” just like in conventional manufacturing. While physical supply chains have well established chains-of-custody to establish properties like refrigeration maintenance, authenticity or spoilage avoidance, the software supply chain is very much a wild, wild west, filled with vulnerabilities that can be (and are) inadvertently inserted into applications.
</p>
<p>
As supply chain risk and mitigations are being explored by government and academia, a larger attack surface is being uncovered that needs to be addressed. This presentation describes the parts of the software supply chain, how vulnerabilities have been introduced, the growing attack surface from new methods of building and distributing software, and the actions that developers can employ to avoid or mitigate the risks inherent in an assembly-based software development strategy.

	<div>
		
<p>I am doing software development for the last 15 years. Since I heard the term “Full Stack Developer” few years back I had a strong dislike for this term. To most people full stack developer is someone who can write frontend code, build backend APIs, and deploy applications to cloud. They can code in multiple programming languages(JS/Typescript, Golang/Java/C#/Python), knows enough to design and store data in either relational and NoSQL databases, follow DevOps practices (CI, Configuration management, etc.), knows about multiple architecture styles – Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless, and can at least deploy to one public cloud. Along with all this they also know and practice automation testing and can write clean, maintainable code.</p>



<p>In my 15 years of software engineering career I have grown technically by following many hypes and technology movements. It takes year to build proficiency in technologies and you have to keep evolving yourself.</p>



<ol><li>In my first four (2005-2009) years I got introduced to Agile and extreme programming so I started practicing automation testing, refactoring, and continuous integration since the beginning of my career.</li><li>In my next three (2009-2011) years I got associated with software craftsmanship movement so clean code, SOLID principles became part of me.</li><li>Then in the next three years(2011-2014) I got into NoSQL and cloud computing. I was OpenShift technology evangelist for a couple of years.</li><li>Then in the next five+ (2014-till now) got into DevOps, containerisation, functional programming(Scala, Haskell), React/Angular, Microservices, Serverless, and many other.</li></ol>



<p>I didn’t pick all these technologies in a couple of years. It took me 15 years. I followed different movements and I was at the right place at the right time. So, I end up riding these waves. One thing that is true with technologies is that once you have worked and seen plenty of them then most new technologies make sense easily to you. Many new things are just old rehashed stuff.</p>



<p>These days every young engineer I meet say they are a full stack developer. Most organisations are trying to hire full stack developers with 2-4 years of working experience. We are just fooling ourselves. There are even courses on full stack software development. We find new ways to mint money.</p>



<p>You can’t become a full stack developer in a couple of years. It takes years when you have strong interest in technology and work with good mentors on interesting software development projects over time. </p>



<p>If someone ask me today do if I consider myself a full stack developer then my answer will be No. I have strong preference for backend development but I can do other stuff if required.</p>



<blockquote><p>To me being a full stack developer has less to do with technology but it has more to do with learning and open mindset. The mindset needed to get things done and learn stuff on the job and in your free time. You don’t want to be labelled one thing or the another. You have to care about the whole stuff even when you work in one specific area. It takes years of effort to become proficient in a specific technology area. You can become an expert in one specific technology area but at the same time you should care about other pieces of your ecosystem as well.</p></blockquote>



<p>Let me share a small example. Few months back I had to help a team that was building an application with REST APIs written in Java Spring Boot, frontend written in Angular, and deployment on Azure. The team was rushed into development and timelines were very short. So, they end up taking many shortcuts. One of the shortcuts was that they didn’t use pagination. This all worked well during development when team was working with limited data but when customer testing team tested with realistic data application started giving performance and memory issues. Application code was fetching all the data from database doing filtering and transformation in Java process and dumping everything to frontend in the JSON payload.</p>



<p>The team estimated that to fix the 20 API endpoints they would require 20 man days. It would be combination of database , frontend, and backend developers that would get this done. This was a no go for the customer as it would impact project delivery. But when you have developers who only care and know about their areas you can’t do much. There are hand offs and integration points when people divide work along technology boundaries. It also leads to wasted effort.</p>



<p>In my view these are the situations where having full stack mindset is important. You have to know different aspects of your stack and get your hands dirty with them.</p>



<p>To conclude the example I took two days and got the full thing working i.e. database, backend, frontend. And deployed it to Azure using Kubernetes. It does not mean full application has to be built this way. I can quickly make code changes on already written frontend code but if you ask me to create a frontend app from scratch and care about all nitty-gritties of CSS along with the backend development then I might not be effective. There is a cost of context switching. The cost we pay when we switch between different technologies. I am not proficient in fronted development but I am good enough to reason it out and make changes if required.</p>

Our users are e-commerce merchants and most of them accept “Cash on delivery” as an option while accepting orders and this leaves a lot of room for fraud to occur where somebody places an order and selects the payment method as “Cash on delivery” without the intention to actually buy the product.</p><p>In order to fix this we introduced a feature where the customer who places a COD order gets an automated message on WhatsApp to confirm their order via a link.</p><figure id="w-node-c4a1f5223dce-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951c3967fc45b644bd89_23sxkg2VnH0KczPacTa60TpnJXRd675pY-TD7m1i8DzhDDZvosqX5cXv9tXTpgyHrF6Rd_PM_-xv37qWKFQOsc6Bx818rC_OcCfJxhfHC-FojE8HjpC9EXqQL_jVq8DJbeIynX31.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Automated WhatsApp message to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on this link would open this web page</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-11a95fb1ed82-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5f0a951bd3ce595371f24095_FScpPINWKrHotUgTY8aLaV9wlay9dcXXurWkK_Ce-jcsF07e5bxofrU9qjaSspkf5UvCAE40CvgKZ57KouSas0GsPBF_RHbLppjgiOhpGqLN0LbQiVIGd0f7yV9pw9pc2g5t6nEP.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Reactjs web app used to confirm a COD&nbsp;order</figcaption></figure><p>Now this web page would be accessed by the customers that buy from the merchants that use our application, so the traffic to this page could be very erratic, not to mention the fact that it would come from various parts of the world where the users internet connection would also be erratic and vary according to the region.</p><p>Therefore it did not make sense to host this web page the way the rest of our application is hosted.

But the process is only complete if the application is accessible as a CDN. For this you would have to use CloudFront and configure it to use your s3 bucket as the source. A comprehensive documentation for this process is given <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few gotchas here as well. The first one being that you will require an SSL certificate to host your application as <strong>https://</strong>. You can get an SSL certificate easily using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/install-ssl-cloudfront/" target="_blank">AWS Certificate manager</a>. This process becomes even more easy if you are using Route53 to manage your domains and subdomains. Even if you use another provider like Godaddy or Bigrock for your domains, I would highly recommend following <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html#migrate-dns-change-name-servers-with-provider" target="_blank">these steps</a> to plug in your domains to Route53.&nbsp;</p><p>The other gotcha here is once again something to do with reactjs URL routing.

<p>If you’ve spent some time in China, especially as an English teacher, you would probably know a few Tigers, Luckys, or Pizzas. Why do some Chinese people pick “funny” names for themselves?</p>

<p>Here’s my theory: In China, most people share a few common family names and thus distinguish themselves by having unique given names. The opposite is true in Europe and the U.S. – common given names, unique family names. Thus, when Chinese students give themselves English names, they try to pick words that are as unique as possible, similar to how their parents picked their Chinese names.</p>

<h2 id="family-names-unique-in-the-u-s-and-the-u-k">Family Names - Unique in the U.S. and the U.K.</h2>

<p>Below are the three most common family names in China, the U.S., and the U.K., as well as their share of the country’s population. It’s clear that family names are a lot more concentrated in China than in the U.S. or the U.K.</p>

<table>

<h2 id="given-names-unique-in-china">Given Names - Unique in China</h2>

<p>Next, I plot the concentration of given names for the three countries. The U.S. and U.K. data is from administrative records, while the Chinese data is assembled from my various other projects (n=300k). The latter is by no means a representative sample of the country’s population, but I was able to confirm that the broad patterns in this non-representative dataset are similar to those seen in China’s 2010 Census.</p>

<p><img src="https://yiqinfu.github.io/images/cn-names/10.png" alt="10">

<img src="https://yiqinfu.github.io/images/cn-names/100.png" alt="100"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>A fifth of the Chinese population shares just <em>three</em> family names. Thus, parents try to give as distinct a given name as possible to their children. The typical naming process involves opening a dictionary and finding (often esoteric) characters that embody the values the parents wish to impart on the child. For example, the parents may decide that they like the concept of light and shine. In Chinese, any character with the “sun” radical would work as a given name, e.g. 光, 明, 亮, 闪, 皓, 晖, 昭, 璨, 煜, etc. In English, however, the options would be quite limited, and parents in the U.S. and the U.K. typically do not start the naming process with some “values” in mind anyways.</p>

<p>Many Chinese people adopt the “find-a-unique-word” approach when picking their English names, so that’s why you may know a Shimmer Zhang or a Sparkle Wang. The broader trend in the U.S. and the U.K. is towards more and more unique given names, so maybe Shimmers and Sparkles won’t be that odd in a few decades!</p>

Updated 2020-07-15: 

There is a an updated, expanded version of this post available <a href="http://amattn.com/p/crdts_in_a_nutshell.html">here</a>.

</p>

<p>

Updated 2020-07-13: 

Riak is not really a thing anymore, but the post still stands up well as a very simple explanation of CRDTs. If you swap out any mention of Riak with multi-node, multi-region distributed datastore, you will get basically the same value out of the post.
</p>

<p>Every time I talk to someone about Riak, I mention about how difficult it was to get distributed counters working.  Then I mention about how I ended up implementing a impoverished man’s version of CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types).</p>

<p>The usual response is along the lines but doesn’t Riak solve that with their read/write quorum functionality?</p>

<p>The answer is no.</p>

<p>This is a surprising answer to a common misperception of Riak.  So common that at my very first Riak meetup, I asked a variation of the same question.</p>

<p>In a distributed data store such as Riak, you have two basic kinds of inconsistencies that require resolution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Simultaneous Read and Write</li>
<li>Simultaneous Write and Write</li>
</ol>

<p>In case 1, If you are writing a value to a key, that value needs to be replicated to a few other nodes.  This is where the read quorum (for fetches) and write quorum (for stores) come into play: While reading or writing, I must have X number of nodes agree on what the correct value is.  You can set X to be all the nodes to get a strong certainty of getting the most recent value.  If X is 1 then you might give up on getting the latest value in exchange for some improvement to latency.  The typical, balanced and default solution is to set X to be a simple majority of nodes.</p>

<p>In case 2, the write quorum has no practical use.  If you have a 10-node cluster, and some client writes “flub” to nodeA and some other client writes “biggle” to nodeF, then we have something called siblings.  How do you decide who wins?  This is where sibling resolution comes into play.  There are many, many strategies for this.  The simplest involve last-write-wins (which is a good way to lose data if you have a counter).</p>

<p>What happens in practice is that you cannot think about a distributed data store in terms of sets and gets.  You need to approach it more like an operation log.  A counter works well in a distributed system if you are only adding.  Each client simply tags his increment with some arbitrary but unique client ID.  The operation is not get x, then set x+1, but rather <code>counterID:ABC:clientID:XYZ:count:+1</code>.  Since it’s add-only, if you have multiple counters incrementing at once, they will only modify their own clientID entry.  If client <code>PRQ</code> adds 1 to nodeA while client <code>XYZ</code> adds 1, 1 and 1 to nodeF, you would see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    counterID:ABC:clientID:PRQ:count:1
    counterID:ABC:clientID:XYZ:count:3
]
</code></pre>

<p>or posisbly this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    counterID:ABC:clientID:PRQ:count:1
    counterID:ABC:clientID:XYZ:count:1
    counterID:ABC:clientID:XYZ:count:2
    counterID:ABC:clientID:XYZ:count:3
]
</code></pre>

<p>To get the total count of the <code>ABC</code> counter, simply add up all the counts, taking the highest value per clientID. Both of the above examples resolve to 4.  You could eventually whip up some garbage collection to clean up older entries if space is something you care about.</p>

<p>Add-only-counters are great but if you need counters that go up <em>and</em> down, you have to get a little clever.  If you keep two counters, <code>posABC</code> and <code>negABC</code> and subtract, you effectively get a couter that can go in both directions.</p>

<p>And now we have Conflict-free Replicated Data Types:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CRDTs can be thought of as primitive, resolvable operation logs that can be composed into useful data types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a real world operation, you would do lots and lots of finicky housekeeping around compression of the log as high-volume writes start to get expensive in terms of storage.  But hopefully the concept is clearer.</p>

<p>CRDTS are exciting (in the way that only useful mathematical properties are).  The add-only-counter and the add-only-set versions of these are relatively straight-forward.  Some very smart people have created CRDTs for more complex data types like lists, maps and even directed graphs.  Searching for CRDTs should bring you to the work of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/dl.aspx?id=153540">Marc Shapiro</a>.</p>

<p>If you are patient, the very smart people at Basho are working to integrate CRDTs into Riak itself.</p>

<p>But if you really want to learn this stuff go implement a multi-node, write-heavy counter in a three node Riak cluster (make sure allow_mult=true).  I found it to be a great learning experience.</p>

		<p>I just wanted to write this to start the conversation in order to disrupt amateur radio’s status quo, in response to K0NR’s blog, “<em><a href="http://www.k0nr.com/wordpress/2017/11/internet-destroying-amateur-radio/">Is The Internet Destroying Amateur Radio?</a></em>” This was a great analysis by Bob, and it really paints a picture of the current state of the hobby, including the apparent distaste for internet-connected amateur radio technologies.</p>
<p>And also because nobody else has had an article with this title, so why not?&nbsp; Despite being clickbait, the title isn’t wrong. Millennials are definitely killing ham radio, just like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8">they’re killing everything else.</a> Here’s how.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I am 25 years old. Also and this blog is a rant, full of unverifiable anecdotes and wild propositions, probably a few spelling errors, and many incoherent thoughts. Opinions are my own. QRZ OM’s beware.</p>

<p>The Hobbiest Computer movement of the 80s (all of you with a TRS-80) is now the hacker/maker movement, automating life with microcontrollers, tiny computers, and data centers.</p>
<p>Amateur radio is to The Baby Boomer and Generation X’s youth as IOT is to Millennials and Gen Y.</p>
<p>Interest in “talking to people on the radio” is waning; it’s about talking to machines, and enabling machines to talk to us. That’s why the maker movement is such a hit, especially now as commercial entities have also entered the fray with off the shelf IoT devices. I’m thankful for the the ARRL for realizing this critical market, and repping ham radio at many Makerfaires and Hackercons.</p>

<p>China controls hardware development and manufacturing. We (the US (Silicon Valley)) specialize in software. Homebrewing hardware from scratch isn’t going to be a thing in the next 20 years, because the ashes of failed electronic appliances from which many a ham radio Phoenix was born are no longer durable, salvageable, salvageable goods – once dead and broken, they’re trash.</p>
<p>Now is the time of software homebrewing, and the idea of ham radio as a means to an end.</p>
<p>The evidence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heathkit, despite their resurrection, can’t figure their $h!+ out. They just can’t. Other kit companies (like Ramsey) have shut down, as well as Radioshack.</li>
<li>Elecraft stopped making thru-hole kits in favor of assembly projects with pre-populated surface-mount PCBs. Many other outfits stopped kit building entirely, because it’s just cheaper to have China do all of the fab and assembly.</li>
<li>Software defined radio, in general, is dominating the radio communications market, both from a hobbyist perspective (RTLSDR, HackRF), an academic one (GNURadio, USRP) to commercial and military (to name a few: cell phones, airband radios; weather, civil air, and tactical radar systems; radio observatories;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network">&nbsp;MANET</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Tactical_Information_Distribution_System">JTIDS</a>)</li>
<li>The non-traditional sense of ham radio is quickly becoming a centerpiece, if not a regular side-item, of <a href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a>&nbsp;articles, makerspaces, and makerfaires.</li>
</ol>
<p>However,&nbsp; I will admit the <a href="https://heilsound.com/amateur-radio-post/the-pine-board-project/">Ham Nation Pineboard project</a> is particularly popular, and is doing a great thing bringing tubes back into focus and captivating/inspiring viewers to try it themselves, but I’m going out on a limb saying it’s probably most popular with their target demographic…a young person might be following along but it’s not changing the face of the hobby anytime soon. One of the student members of&nbsp; W0EEE (Missouri S&amp;T) is a die-hard tube fanatic, but to everyone else, he’s the tube guy.</p>
<p>Speaking of which – target demographic. The target demographic of every single amateur radio show, podcast, club, media outlet, society, magazine, livestream, or otherwise, is not young people.</p>
<p>The ARRL however, has been making a lot of good strides to engage the new generation of hams (<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-expands-initiative-to-fire-up-collegiate-amateur-radio-clubs">1</a>)(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/arrlhq/">2</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-now-on-snapchat">3</a>)(<a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-represented-at-world-maker-fair-in-new-york-city-school-club-to-exhibit">4</a>), yet still, the ARRL can only do so much to interest younger people, which takes away resources from engaging their demographic core of white male retirees.&nbsp; For example – why no youth editor? I was the last one, before my editor, Khrystyne K1SFA, left the ARRL, which left a hole requiring them to kill the Youth Editor (<a href="http://n0ssc.com/blogs/arrlyouthcolumns">the articles still remain on their website</a>), and The Amateur Amateur (<a href="http://gary-ross-hoffman.com/Ham/index.html">which still exists at his website</a>). But why no top-level Youth Coordinator? Why not a report on the effort of, or a collaboration between, our Section Youth Coordinators in the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/field-organization">ARRL Field Organization Structure</a>? Are we all just relying on <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/carole-perry-wb2mgp-set-to-host-her-30th-hamvention-youth-forum">Carole Perry</a>‘s and the late <a href="http://oralhistory.boulderlibrary.org/interview/oh1264/">Ellie and Rip Van Winkel’s</a>&nbsp;of the ham radio world to inspire and educate young people about ham radio? Surely there’s opportunity for ARRL, as well as every ham radio club out there.</p>

<p>No. From my experience over the last seven years, digital Amateur Radio is not intrinsically exciting to young people, as many have been touting. It is a lot better than voice and CW, but still exists the fact that as an individual, it’s a troubling process to decide where to spend your (mother’s) money – $300 on a DSTAR radio, $100 for a DMR, both full of people talking about how robotic they sound, or $400 for an HF station to do digital data modes, full of canned responses (PSK31) or hardly any response at all (FT8).</p>
<p>These are also communication between people, which begs the titular question posed by K0NR. People-to-people communication is trivial, and although some young hams (me) find it really cool to talk to people beyond shouting distance with the raw elements of a radio station,what’s much more interesting and impactful to the next generation is is the idea of people-to-machine communication. In other words, Digital Voice is dumb, Digital Data is smart, and the only ways to utilize digital data are explicitly NOT provided by the commercial manufacturers of amateur radio(1), but instead by Adafruit, Ubiquiti; HackRF, RFSpace, and USRP; and soon <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">FaradayRF</a>, among others.</p>

<h2>Remote Operating for HF</h2>
<p>Here’s where I disagree with K0NR’s analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, we can’t really stop the impact of new technology. Oh, I suppose the amateur radio community could petition the FCC to restrict [internet assisted] use of ham radio. There could be regulations that limit the use of the internet being interconnected with Part 97 radio operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that remote operating, and other internet-assisted means of ham radio operation, are critical to youth engagement.</p>
<p>RemoteHamRadio is the shining example of where ham radio operating is heading. they have an awesome <a href="http://www.remotehamradio.com/youth/">Youth Program</a>, allowing young people that are:</p>
<p>– 25 years old or younger<br>– A General class or higher license<br>– A member of the ARRL<br>– Interested in or Experienced with in DXing/Contesting</p>
<p>to operate remote online stations for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.remotehams.com/">Remote Hams</a> is a totally free alternative, but it’s up to the host to restrict operation, which is frustrating when you’re clicking through servers, only to find it’s locked by membership to whatever radio club is hosting it.</p>
<p>Finally <a href="http://websdr.org/">WebSDR</a> and <a href="http://sdr.hu/openwebrx">OpenWebRX</a> are always open to everyone to receive tons of spectrum, remotely.</p>
<p>Despite that, it’s ultimately a much MUCH better solution in the short term for young hams to operate remotely, than it is to persuade their mom’s to fork up a relative ton of money for a radio, antenna, a pole if no trees are around…etc.</p>
<p>Because young people do not often have access to the the kind of money an HF radio station requires, I strongly believe to captivate more young people, we need to do more of one of these two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Promote your club’s shack, your own shack to young people.</li>
<li>Put your shack on a remote service provider for others to use when you’re not.</li>
</ol>
<p>For young people to join the hobby, it’s critically important to&nbsp;<strong>bring ham radio where the young people are,&nbsp;</strong>which is, for the most part, the internet.</p>
<p>If I knew this when I was younger, my mom would have been around $900 richer!</p>
<h2>Ham Radio Hackathons</h2>
<p>One thing I’m thinking of&nbsp; starting up are Ham Radio Hackathons. I mentioned it<a href="http://n0ssc.com/posts/560-ham-radio-analysis-paralysis"> in a previous blog</a> which has surprisingly gotten a lot of traction with my <a href="http://n0ssc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/T2miAyF.png">tiny contingent of readers</a>.</p>
<p>A hackathon isn’t a coding competition. It’s explained well in <a href="https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/wtf-is-a-hackathon-92668579601">this Medium article.</a> It goes even further than that, not limited to coders and engineers, but open to thinkers, doers, philosophers, system engineers, math people, teachers, students, artists, stakeholders…anyone with an interest in <strong>solving a problem with technology. </strong></p>
<p>Ham radio has a bunch of problems with technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s far behind the curve. We’re spitting out digital modes faster than K9PG can work a sweep, but compared to what’s already on the shelf, why would anyone bother with ham radio?</li>
<li>When I think about software like Log4OM, LOTW, eQSL, and HRD, I get frustrated. It’s great software, and many volunteer hours have poured into their development, but it’s so feature dense, developed in vacuums, hard to use, buggy, and lacking in UX.&nbsp; A good example of software is Fldigi – it’s fast, and light…hence *<strong>FL*</strong>digi. APRS is really nifty, especially <a href="http://aprs.fi/">aprs.fi</a>, but a person needs too much stuff or really expensive radios to get on it via RF (most people seem to be going direct to APRS-IS anyway) and getting into the development side of it is making me pull my hair out, just starting with the fact it’s based on the Bell 202 modem invented in 1972!!! Are you $#!++!n&amp; me!? I mean, what a fantastic utilization of resources…in 1978. <a href="https://faradayrf.com/">It’s time for something fresh, now.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li>There are dozens of ham radio websites stuck in 1990 (two of them are in K0NR’s blog (<a href="http://www.on4kst.com/index.php">1</a>)(<a href="http://www.pingjockey.net/">2</a>)…I’d&nbsp; almost argue that ham radio is killing the internet!), it seems like every ham radio developer has to repeatedly reinventing the wheel with logging programs, everyone still uses email reflectors, tons of ham radio apps just crash upon startup, the Digital Voice debate (when we should really focus on digital data, breaking through the baudrate limitation, and interlinking everything), the logistical challenges of testing (3 VEs to proctor a test in person, c’mon…that’s not to say I don’t disagree with the lack of practical on-the-air knowledge in the newbie amateur radio generation; however I don’t think that’s not a fault of the amateur, that’s a fault on the lack of elmership to personally show them how it’s done).</li>
<li>What gets us …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Over the past years, I’ve worked in multiple teams adopting very different strategies when it comes to feature flags. I’ve seen the pros and cons of both, and over time, I found myself disagreeing with any fundamentalist position on their use. There is a lot of nuance to this topic, and I think it is worth considering more carefully the various scenarios where feature flags do and do not make sense.</p>



<h2>The Reasons For</h2>



<p>There are a few major scenarios where feature flags make a lot of sense. The first is when it’s used for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="A/B testing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing" target="_blank">A/B testing</a>, where you absolutely do want different behaviors for different users, based on their randomly assigned treatment. I’ve seen this strategy employed extremely well at Amazon where new features are gated by a “feature flag” that is actually controlled by an internal A/B testing framework. The framework randomly exposes some Amazon customers to the new feature, and then monitors their subsequent behavior in order to estimate the business impact of launching the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was initially skeptical, but was soon won over by how easy the framework was to use, and the valuable insights it provided on the benefits (or drawbacks) of certain features. “Flavor of the month” decisions were replaced with real data. And none of this is possible without the use of “feature flags” to dynamically toggle new features.</p>



<hr>



<p>Another great use case for feature flags, is when you’re working on a very complex epic that require many different sub-tasks to be completed in different parts of the system. Sub-tasks that are too numerous and invasive to be done in a single pull-request. </p>



<p>In such cases, trying to keep all these disparate changes in side-branches and coordinating a simultaneous merge and deployment, is a recipe for disaster. It’s far more manageable to gate any disruptive changes behind a master flag, merge and deploy all the sub-commits incrementally, and do a flag-flip once all the pieces are in place.</p>



<hr>



<p>One last use case for feature flags, is when you do not have control over your deployments. For example, consider the Facebook Android app, which contains code contributed by hundreds of different teams, all combined and deployed as a single binary. In such scenarios, performing rollbacks can be infeasible. For practical, political, bureaucratic or even marketing reasons. In such cases, feature flags allow your team to toggle new functionality or mitigate risky changes, without having to rollback or deploy any new binaries.</p>



<h2>Risk Aversion</h2>



<p>The above are all fantastic use cases for feature flags, but I’ve also seen teams get bogged down by policies that overreach in their use. For example, mandating that every single code change should be behind a feature flag, <em>“just in case we made a mistake”</em>.</p>



<p>Risk management should indeed be a priority for all teams. But there are better ways of doing this than relying on feature flags, especially if your team has control over its own deployments. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/04/28/rethinking-software-testing-perspectives-from-the-world-of-hardware/" target="_blank">vast majority of your bugs should be caught by your automated test suite</a> and/or QA process. And the last few stragglers should be handled using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">incremental deployments, production alarms and rollbacks</a>.</p>



<p>Besides, as soon as any problem is detected, the recommendation at places like Google is to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="rollback first and ask questions later (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/reliable-releases-and-rollbacks-cre-life-lessons" target="_blank">rollback first and investigate the problem later</a>. When things are on fire, the last thing you want to do is root-cause the bug and figure out which flag-flip will safely fix the problem. And that may not even fix things – there’s no guarantee that even if your teammate tried to put his changes behind a feature flag, he didn’t inadvertently introduce a bug that cannot be solved by a flag-flip.</p>



<p>Feature flags are no substitute for the ability to do binary rollbacks, and they definitely aren’t a substitute for having a great automated test suite and a robust QA process. If you’re relying on feature flags to remedy production bugs, you should stop and evaluate your team’s practices. Risk aversion is often a smell of your team <a href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time (opens in a new tab)">entering into a doom loop which will only get worse and worse with time</a>.</p>



<h2>Death By Feature Flags</h2>



<p>You may be wondering at this point why we shouldn’t use feature flags anyway. After all, <em>“defense in depth” …</em> and it never hurts to have more fine-grain flexibility right?</p>



<p>While feature flags are great in some cases, we should also keep in mind their costs. Software engineering is primarily an exercise in managing complexity. And each feature flag immediately doubles the universe of corner cases that your programmers have to understand, and your code is required to handle. <em>“But what would happen if Foo is enabled, Bar is disabled, and we do independent A/B tests on Baz and Kaz on the same day?”</em> In my experience, this combinatorial explosion in complexity can and <strong>will</strong> lead to bugs. Not to mention slowing down the speed at which your team can make any changes.</p>



<p><em>“But these feature flags are only temporary. You should be removing them as soon as possible!”</em></p>



<p>Sure, and we should also not allow our tech debt to accumulate and we should follow every single best-practice religiously. Unfortunately, this never happens in any corporate environment. Even in great teams, tech debt often gets de-prioritized in the face of new requests. Newcomers to the team or those on their way out, aren’t always disciplined enough to clean up their flags after a successful rollout. And sometimes, these tasks simply slip through the cracks and get forgotten.</p>



<p>There is no better illustration of this than the KCG debacle where a financial firm lost half a billion dollars and almost went bankrupt in 30 minutes, partly due to dead code that was behind a feature flag.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/blog/bug-day-460m-loss"><em>The cause of the failure</em></a><em> was due to multiple factors. However, one of the most important was that a flag which had previously been used to enable Power Peg… Power Peg had been obsolete since 2003, yet still remained in the codebase some eight years later.</em></p><p><em>In 2005, an alteration was made to the Power Peg code which inadvertently disabled safety-checks which would have prevented such a scenario. However, this update was deployed to a production system at the time, despite no effort having been made to verify that the Power Peg functionality still worked</em></p></blockquote>



<hr>



<p>Feature flags are a powerful tool that can help you experiment with new features, manage the rollout of complex epics, and mitigate the problems associated with not controlling your team’s deployments. </p>



<p>But they come at a significant cost, in the form of code complexity, tech debt, slower development speeds, and inevitably, bugs. </p>



<p>As tempting as it may be, there is no silver bullet here. Weigh the pros against the cons, and use this tool judiciously when it makes sense to do so.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://jacob.jkrall.net/ps2-on-65c02">PS/2 keyboard on a 65C02 breadboard computer</a></h3>
        <p><img src="https://jacob.jkrall.net/image/2020/ps2_hero.jpg" alt="A 6502-based breadboard computer with a PS/2 keyboard"></p>

<p>I’ve been following Ben Eater’s series on
<a href="https://eater.net/6502">building a 6502 computer on a breadboard</a>.
Once I got the 65C22 VIA working with a bigger 4-line x 20-character
LCD display, I wondered if I could interface the computer directly
with an external keyboard. The IBM Personal System/2 (PS/2), released
in 1987, had what became a very commonly used keyboard and mouse
connector, which uses some convenient electrical signals for
interfacing with even-more-ancient technology like the
WDC 65C02 and 65C22 this breadboard computer is based on.</p>

<h2 id="physical-layout">Physical layout</h2>
<p>Electrically, PS/2 is very simple: power, ground, clock, and data.
The clock is driven by a microcontroller inside the keyboard, at a
rate around 10-16.7 kHz. The data line is valid when the clock is low.
Data and clock are open-collectors, so they can be connected directly to
the computer with pullup resistors.</p>

<p>I acquired a PS/2 connector and soldered four wires to the correct pins.
+5V on power, 0V on ground, and the keyboard flashed its three status lights
so I know I didn’t short it out or install the pins backwards. That’s good.</p>

<p><img src="https://jacob.jkrall.net/image/2020/ps2_solder.jpg" alt="PS/2 connector soldered to four wires"></p>

<p>I connected the PS/2 clock wire to <code>NMIB</code> (pin 6 on the DIP-40 W65C02S),
and tied it to the 5V rail using a 1kΩ pull-up resistor.
Because I was making hardware changes anyway, I also added a pushbutton
to <code>IRQB</code> (pin 4 of the W65C02S) for an easy way to trigger a second
kind of interrupt. (It helped a lot when debugging - in the interrupt
service handler, I could print whatever info I wanted.)
<img src="https://jacob.jkrall.net/image/2020/ps2_clk.jpg" alt="PS/2 Clock line tied to 65C02S NMIB"></p>

<p>Similarly, the data line is tied to <code>PA0</code> (pin 2 of the 40-pin W65C22)
with a 1kΩ pull-up resistor as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://jacob.jkrall.net/image/2020/ps2_data.jpg" alt="PS/2 Data line tied to VIA PA0"></p>

<h2 id="6502-interrupts">6502 interrupts</h2>
<p>The two interrupt pins on the 6502 are used slightly differently.
The non-maskable interrupt (<code>NMIB</code>) is edge-triggered, which generally
means only one interrupt source can use it. But that’s great for PS/2,
since we only want to interrupt on each clock signal once.</p>

<p>The interrupt request (<code>IRQB</code>) is level-triggered: the processor will
generate interrupts as long as interrupts are enabled and the input is low.
This means it’s much easier to service multiple devices, but there has to
be some way to clear the interrupt on the other end - and we don’t really have
that ability on the PS/2 bus, so it’s not a good choice, unless we want
to add some glue logic. That sounds expensive, and I don’t have a lot of
space left on my breadboard.</p>

<h2 id="using-some-nicer-vasm-flags">Using some nicer <code>vasm</code> flags</h2>
<p>The WDC65C02S supports some additional opcodes, so I’m going to let vasm
understand those with the <code>-wdc02</code> flag. I also added <code>-chklabels</code>, <code>-wfail</code>,
and <code>-x</code>. These warn when a label matches a mnemonic/directive, return an
error code on warnings, and show an error when referencing an undefined
symbol, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="do-nothing-interrupts">Do-nothing interrupts</h2>
<p>First, define two no-op interrupt handlers, <code>nmi</code> and <code>irq_brk</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>irq_brk:</span>
  <span>rti</span>

<span>nmi:</span>
  <span>rti</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Set up the vectors for each of them - this replaces the <code>.org $fffc</code>
from Ben Eater’s video:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>.</span><span>org</span> <span>$fffa</span>
  <span>.</span><span>word</span> <span>nmi</span>
  <span>.</span><span>word</span> <span>reset</span>
  <span>.</span><span>word</span> <span>irq_brk</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In our reset handler, we will need to enable interrupts with</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>cli</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, it’s time to declare and initialize some memory. First,
name four bytes in the zero-page:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>KEY_BUF_X</span> <span>=</span> <span>$00</span>
<span>KEY_READ_X</span> <span>=</span> <span>$01</span>
<span>PS2_BIT_NUMBER</span> <span>=</span> <span>$02</span>
<span>PS2_NEXT_BYTE</span> <span>=</span> <span>$03</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The actual values aren’t important -
they’re pointers to bytes in the first 256B of RAM.</p>

<p>The first two, <code>KEY_BUF_X</code> and <code>KEY_READ_X</code> are offsets into a
256-byte circular array. Let’s name that array:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>KEY_BUF</span> <span>=</span> <span>$0200</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The second two variables are used for decoding the PS/2 byte. For now,
let’s initialize them all to zero in the <code>reset</code> handler.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>stz</span> <span>KEY_BUF_X</span>
  <span>stz</span> <span>KEY_READ_X</span>
  <span>stz</span> <span>PS2_BIT_NUMBER</span>
  <span>stz</span> <span>PS2_NEXT_BYTE</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>All of this does nothing, but we’ve reserved all the space in RAM
needed to decode the raw PS/2 byte stream.</p>

<h2 id="handling-the-interrupts">Handling the interrupts</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, the PS/2 clock rate is between 10-16.7 kHz, and the
data line is only valid for the low half of the clock cycle.</p>

<p>My computer has a 1MHz clock, so that means we have 1M/16.7k = 59.88 cycles
to completely handle the NMI. And the data is only valid in the first half.</p>

<p>The WDC65C02 takes 6 (or 7?) cycles to process an interrupt, and can only
process an interrupt once the previous instruction has completed, so
we may already be 12 or 13 cycles in by the time we start the very first
instruction of the interrupt handler!</p>

<p>We’ll read PORTA from the 65C22 VIA, and need to use some bitmasking to get
the first bit. It would be very convenient if the high bit were set, instead
of the low bit, but I’m already using <code>PA7</code> for the <code>E</code> pin on the LCD, and
don’t want to break compatibility with Ben’s code just for convenience.</p>

<p>So, during the interrupt routine, I’ll rotate <code>PA0</code> into the <code>PA7</code> position,
and then mask it out.</p>

<p>Define the <code>PA7</code> bit mask:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>KEY_DATA</span> <span>=</span> <span>%10000000</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And update the NMI handler to write the PS/2 bit into <code>KEY_BUF</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>nmi:</span>
  <span>pha</span> <span>; preserve A register</span>

  <span>lda</span> <span>PORTA</span> <span>; the data bit is in the low bit of A</span>
  <span>ror</span>       <span>; the data bit is in the carry flag</span>
  <span>ror</span>       <span>; the data bit is in the high bit of A</span>
  <span>and</span> <span>#KEY_DATA</span> <span>; all other bits have been cleared</span>


  <span>; store A in KEY_BUF[KEY_BUF_X]</span>
  <span>phx</span>
  <span>ldx</span> <span>KEY_BUF_X</span>
  <span>sta</span> <span>KEY_BUF</span><span>,</span><span>x</span>
  <span>inc</span> <span>KEY_BUF_X</span>

  <span>; restore X,A in correct order</span>
  <span>plx</span>
  <span>pla</span>

  <span>; complete the interrupt</span>
  <span>rti</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="decoding-the-bitstream">Decoding the bitstream</h2>
<p>Decoding a PS/2 bitstream takes a few more cycles than we can afford
in our non-maskable interrupt handler. So, the handler is wasteful
and writes the bit samples as bytes in a 256-byte circular buffer.</p>

<p>In our main loop, we can chase after the bitstream using a simple
state machine.</p>

<p>The states are defined by the number of bits we’ve seen.</p>

<p>First bit (state 0) is a start bit.
It’s followed by eight data bits (states 1-8), least-significant-first.
Then, there’s a parity bit (state 9).
Then, there’s a stop bit (state 10).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>loop:</span>

<span>ps2_check_bit:</span>

  <span>jmp</span> <span>loop</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="reading-scan-codes">Reading scan codes</h2>
<p>PS/2 does not send ASCII, it sends scan codes. Most PS/2 keyboards
use the “Set 2” codes. The characters we are concerned with send a
one-byte “make” code when the key is pressed (and a few times per
second while the key is held), and a two-byte “break” code when the
key is released.</p>

<p>A nice abstraction would be to decode these scancodes into a buffer,
which would allow us to do line editing and so forth, but I’m just
going to print all the characters I recognize directly to the LCD.</p>

<p>In <code>ps2_stop_bit</code>, add a</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>jsr</span> <span>print_ps2_key</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and let’s go implement that now.</p>

<p>First, we need to create a map for the PS/2 scan codes. You can
sort of see how the key matrix is wired in the keyboard.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>.</span><span>align</span> <span>8</span>
<span>ps2_scan_codes:</span>
  <span>;       0123456789ABCDEF</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"??????????????`?"</span> <span>; 0</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"?????Q1???ZSAW2?"</span> <span>; 1</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"?CXDE43?? VFTR5?"</span> <span>; 2</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"?NBHGY6???MJU78?"</span> <span>; 3</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"?,KIO09??./L;P-?"</span> <span>; 4</span>
  <span>.</span><span>asc</span> <span>"??'?[=?????]?</span><span>\</span><span>??"</span> <span>; 5</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, add another byte to the zero page so we can ignore break codes:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm">  <span>PS2_IGNORE_NEXT_CODE</span> <span>=</span> <span>$04</span>

  <span>; ... in `reset`:</span>
  <span>stz</span> <span>PS2_IGNORE_NEXT_CODE</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, let’s implement the <code>print_ps2_key</code> subroutine:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nesasm"><span>print_ps2_key:</span>
  <span>; if we received #$F0 previously, ignore this byte</span>
  <span>bit</span> <span>PS2_IGNORE_NEXT_CODE</span>
  <span>bmi</span> <span>code_ignored</span>

  <span>; A is scan code.</span>
  <span>; see if we got a break code</span>
  <span>cmp</span> <span>#$F0</span>
  <span>beq</span> <span>ignore_next</span>

  <span>; Bounds check ps2_scan_codes</span>
  <span>cmp</span> <span>#$5F</span>
  <span>bpl</span> <span>too_high</span>

  <span>; index into ps2_scan_codes</span>
  <span>tax</span>
  <span>lda</span> <span>ps2_scan_codes</span><span>,</span><span>x</span>
  <span>jsr</span> <span>print_char</span>
  <span>rts</span>

<span>too_high:</span>
  <span>rts</span>

<span>ignore_next:</span>
  <span>lda</span> <span>#$FF</span>
  <span>sta</span> <span>PS2_IGNORE_NEXT_CODE</span>
  <span>rts</span>

<span>code_ignored:</span>
  <span>stz</span> <span>PS2_IGNORE_NEXT_CODE</span>
  <span>rts</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There’s still a ton more work to do, like Shift, Backspace, arrow keys
and even outputting lines to the correct place on the screen. Like I
mentioned above, it would probably make more sense to store these ASCII
codes in a line buffer, or whatever suits your application’s purpose.
You could even use another circular buffer with chasing pointers.</p>

<p>But hey, at least we can say <code>HELLO, WORLD,</code> and that’s what matters.</p>

<h2 id="postscript-1-day-later">Postscript (1 day later)</h2>
<p>Fairly frequently, I saw extraneous NMIs. Since I’m not doing any
error checking on the stop/start/parity bits, this would appear as a
shifted bit in the byte stream. The first thing I changed was using
a 1kΩ resistor on the NMI pin instead of 1MΩ. I thought
the higher resistance was causing the voltage to rise too slowly.
It certainly helped, but I still could rarely type a full 80-character
page of text without seeing a desynchronization. I tried using a
faster 1.8432 MHz oscillator, to see if my interrupt code was too slow,
but that neither made sense, nor fixed the issue. (A 7.3728 MHz
oscillator was too fast for the existing LCD code. Needs <code>NOP</code>s.)
Finally, I wondered if the additional power demanded by the keyboard
(and its long cable) was still causing voltage drops.
I added another 10µF capacitor to the power rails,
near the PS/2 power wires, and now it is much better.
I still see desynchronization if I mash on the keyboard, but it’s
waaaaay more usable than it was.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
          <p><span></span> read
          </p>
          <a name="topofpage"></a>
          <p>I have been thinking about brand loyalty for a while now and I thought I’d share some rough thoughts about this. Nothing ground breaking, but one that I think most businesses can begin to apply if they have the right tools. Let’s start with the <em>Loyalty</em></p>

<h3 id="loyalty">Loyalty</h3>
<p>Brand loyalty is hard to build, especially in the face of increasing competition. Why should a person stick to a brand? While exceptional customer service is great and one that all business should take seriously, in most cases, it may not be enough. 
People will begin to want more if exceptional customer service becomes  the common denominator(in an ideal world).</p>

<p>So how else do you keep people coming back? I will suggest rewarding their behaviour and create a <em>cool</em> factor in the process. This both helps the people feel great about their choices and benefits the brand too.</p>

<p>Prints, radio, TV and in recent times, online advertisement have all been effective marketing tools. While there’s nothing generally wrong with these mediums, I, as a customer, will appreciate a tangible reward as a way of marketing. It could be as simple as shopping vouchers. I strongly believe there’s a high likelihood of another person seeing this and wanting a piece of the action.</p>

<p>But today, I will propose another form of reward; experiences. Give people experiences as a form of reward. I strongly believe people rarely forget experiences, especially if it makes them feel good about themselves.</p>

<h3 id="aspiration">Aspiration</h3>
<p>Most people, if not everyone is aspirational. It’s inherently a human nature to aspire to something; social class, economic status, security, etc. We are always looking forward to the next level and this is perfectly okay.</p>

<p>Brands who are looking to build mindshare for a long time, especially within a certain income class should position themselves as aspirational brands. Little wonder why people begin to feel “cool” with themselves the moment the snag their first Apple product; iPhone, Watch, Mac, iPad. It’s the cool factor and satisfaction that these products give.</p>

<h3 id="mechanics-of-the-reward-system">Mechanics of the reward system</h3>
<p>In this case, these brands can use the loyalty/rewards system to build their own cool. For example, if every time you shopped at a certain location or make a certain transaction with some organisation you get a point, these organisations can now begin to segment its user base based on point. Let’s take a case simple scenario here.</p>

<p>Customers with a certain amount of points will qualify for Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. These points can now be converted for different things, in this case, I will suggest experiential. Bronze member can get a full body massage at a spa or a one-month gym membership, Silver members can get a one-month gym membership, Gold Members can get both a full body massage and a one-month gym membership. The platinum members can, on the other hand, get a full body massage, a one-month gym membership and a private networking event with other platinum members once a month for a quarter.</p>

<p>As you begin to use these offers, you fall to a certain level, if a Bronze member uses their spa points, they fall to level zero, when a Silver member use either of their offers, they fall to Bronze and can work their way back up. When a Gold member use one of their offers, they fall to the Silver level, they can choose to build back their points and stay as Gold members or even progress to the Platinum membership band. Platinum members don’t fall, they maintain that status for as long as they want, but the moment they activate/use an offer they have 6 months to use the benefits or risk losing it.</p>

<p>The business can then change the rewards on a yearly basis. It is one way to keep the users hook, especially when the rewards will always come as a surprise.</p>

<p>This actually explain why I go to SPAR for groceries instead of ShopRite.</p>

<h3 id="cross-marketing">Cross Marketing</h3>
<p>The great things about the offers are that it forms an opportunity for cross-marketing for all the participating businesses. People who go to the gym can suddenly discover that brand X will offer free gym membership if they signed up for their services and the same goes for the spa. The gym and spa can now have opportunities to market to new potential customers. A win-win for everyone.</p>

<h3 id="brand-equity">Brand equity.</h3>
<p>Brand equity is a really big deal. People associate themselves with brand names than the actual product themselves. Little wonder why people will be quick to remind you that they are wearing Gucci than talk about the feel of the cotton fabric. You almost can’t place value to it. And as people watch close friends and allies begin to associate with the cool of your brand, they will want the same for themselves.</p>

<p><span>In today’s world of plug-and-play peripheral devices, it is difficult to understand the fundamentals of what is happening at the lower levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the computer connect to the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does it communicate with the device?<span>&nbsp; </span>How does the software make the device do its magic?</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Eric Rangell and I was a teenager in the 1980s.<span>&nbsp; </span>My first computer was an Apple //e in 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before my family got a computer, I learned Basic programming from my brother’s college textbook and practiced writing programs on paper for a year before the Apple found a home in my brother’s room.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the limited computer time I had, I practiced coding, debugging, and refining my programs until they did what I wanted.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Apple ][ series of computers was designed so that owners could learn everything about how their machines worked if they took the time to study the available documentation and experiment with the machine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today, early Apple computers can help young people grasp the fundamentals of how a computer works, and that will help them as they progress in their studies and careers.</span></p>
<p><span>In this article I will walk through a simple project that can be built using an Apple ][ series computer that has an internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>It uses one of the Annunciator digital outputs to send MIDI data to a MIDI instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The process of building it and persisting through any problems you encounter will give you a sense of mastery and enjoyment, give you a tool to express your creativity, and challenge you to continue tinkering with the project as you learn more advanced computer science concepts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Parents and teachers are encouraged to learn how to build this project and help children work through it as they build an electronic device, write simple programs in Basic to control the device, and imagine additional applications that can use the device.</span></p>
<p><span>MIDI can play notes and music on keyboard synthesizers, as well as send commands to modules which control music playback, drum patterns, and even lighting.<span>&nbsp; </span>MIDI uses a very simple communication protocol to send binary messages to instruments.<span>&nbsp; </span>There really is nothing magical about it – the computer is just sending bytes which represent commands such as “Play a middle C”, “Stop playing the middle C”, “Change the instrument sound to Violin”, “Change the volume”.<span>&nbsp; </span>The objective of this project is for the student to understand how the computer varies voltage levels on an output port using specific timings according to a protocol that the musical instrument receiving the data understands.<span>&nbsp; </span>By building the interface from scratch, the student knows that the data is traveling on wires that they connected, and controlled by software that they wrote, using a driver program that is conceptually easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start building the interface, read this entire article and gather the parts you need.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many modern musical instruments have USB interfaces for MIDI.<span>&nbsp; </span>Look for older synthesizer keyboards with the round 5 pin DIN MIDI sockets, or USB MIDI interfaces that have the round connectors.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may need a MIDI coupler in order to connect a MIDI cable to one of those interfaces.</span></p>

<p><span>Before you proceed any further, you want to make sure all wires are properly connected and that the signals from the Apple are reaching the breadboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>While there are only 3 pins needed to build the MIDI interface project, take the time to test the additional signals available on the Internal Game I/O socket.<span>&nbsp; </span>All pin numbers below refer to pin numbers on the Internal Game I/O socket.</span></p>

<p><span>1. Test the voltage between +5V (pin 1) and GND (pin 8).<span>&nbsp; </span>Use a multimeter to verify that the voltage level coming to the breadboard is at least +5 volts. The red wire connects pin 1 to the side holes for Power and the green wire connects pin 8 to side holes for Ground. Connect the probes of the multimeter to the Power and Ground of the breadboard, and set the dial to measure voltage.</span></p>

<p><span>You can also test the logic of the </span><span>Annunciators using a Digital Logic Probe, as shown left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Connect the probe terminals to the +5V and GND signals on the breadboard, then touch the tip of the probe to the Annunciator pin.<span>&nbsp; </span>The photos below show how the Digital Logic Probe responds when it detects logical HIGH and logical LOW voltages on Annunciator 0.</span></p>




<p><span><b>Inverters and Buffers</b></span></p>
<p><span>The MIDI specification defines the MIDI OUT Circuit as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>The signal from the transmitting device (labeled UART in the diagram below-left) passes through 2 inverters, then a 220 Ohm resistor, and is sent to Pin 5 on the circular 5 pin DIN connector labelled MIDI OUT.<span>&nbsp; </span>The +5V signal is sent through a 220 Ohm resistor to Pin 4 of the MIDI OUT connector.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pin 2 is connected to Ground, and the shield of the MIDI cable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pins 1 and 3 are not connected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Polarity matters because a MIDI cable will connect your MIDI OUT port to the MIDI IN port of a musical instrument.<span>&nbsp; </span>The signals sent on your MIDI OUT port need to drive a phototransistor inside an opto-isolator in the MIDI IN circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the signal from the UART is negative, the current loop is completed and the opto-isolator receives the signal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Communication is established by following a timing protocol for flipping the signals to represent the bits and bytes of MIDI messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this project we will control the timing of the messages with the Apple’s 6502 timing, to illustrate that there is nothing magical going on – if we get the timing right and follow the protocol, we will successfully communicate with a MIDI instrument.</span></p>

<p><span>Inverters change the input signal from HIGH to LOW, or LOW to HIGH.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, two inverters will leave the input signal unchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two inverters form a buffer, which ensures that the signal does not get degraded if voltage fluctuates due to additional loads on the circuit.<span>&nbsp; </span>While it may be possible to drive the signal directly from the Apple without using the buffers, that introduces an element of uncertainty that can make your device unreliable under certain conditions.<span>&nbsp; </span>So initially we will build the circuit with two inverters (following the MIDI spec), and then test modifying it to use only one inverter (by logically inverting all the signals sent by the driver software).</span></p>

            <p>In a world where the value of time is steadily increasing, building applications that users can interact with in real-time has become a norm for most of the developers. Most of the applications we see today, whether they are mobile, desktop, or web applications, have at least a single real-time feature included. As an example, real-time messaging and notifications are two of the most commonly used real-time features used in applications.</p>
<p>In this article, we are introducing you to the development of real-time applications using Node.js by building a real-time chat. Though the article will focus on this specific use-case, the concepts here taught can apply to other scenarios.</p>
<p>In fact, Node is one of the best programming languages out there to build real-time applications due to its event-driven and asynchronous nature. Before diving into building a real-time application head-first, we’ll see what kind of real-time applications we can build using Node.js.
If you want to know more other areas where Node.js excels or simply falls short, read my article <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-05-27-when-you-should-and-should-not-use-nodejs-for-your-project/">When You Should and Shouldn’t Use Node.js for Your Project</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-real-time-applications-used">Where are Real-time Applications Used?</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, messaging and notification delivery are two of the most common use cases for real-time applications. But we can use real-time applications for a myriad of other purposes. Let’s see what they are.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="real-time-messaging">Real-time Messaging</h3>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the use of real-time messaging applications, especially in mobile devices, in the form of Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, and numerous other messaging applications. However, real-time messaging is used not limited to purely messaging applications. We see real-time messaging features in on-demand taxi apps, delivery apps, and collaborative platforms.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-notification-delivery">Real-time Notification Delivery</h3>
<p>Enabling real-time notifications has proved to be a game-changer when it comes to increasing user engagement with applications. For this reason, you would hardly see a modern application that does not deliver notifications in real-time to its users.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="live-streaming">Live Streaming</h3>
<p>Live streams that users can interact with in real-time are becoming more and more popular after social media platforms integrated live video streams to their applications. Instagram and Facebook live video streaming features are the best examples of this.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="real-time-tracking">Real-time Tracking</h3>
<p>With the introduction of popular taxi and delivery applications, like Uber and Amazon, tracking the progress of users’ taxi rides or deliveries in real-time has become an essential requirement. Their real-time progress updates increase the usability and reliability of these applications.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="iot-devices">IoT Devices</h3>
<p>Real-time features are essential for IoT devices. Data captured by the sensors placed in IoT devices are transmitted, processed, and displayed to the end-users with a minimum delay. Since most of the inputs captured by these devices, like temperature and lighting, constantly change with the time, applications working with IoT devices should be able to receive and send data in real-time.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-can-we-build-real-time-applications">How can We Build Real-time Applications?</h2>
<p>Is building a real-time application different from building a normal web application? The answer is, yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of a messaging application where users can send messages in real-time. These messages should appear on the other users’ application as soon as the messages are sent. If we implement this application like a normal web application, where only the client can initiate requests to the server to receive data, the user has to either refresh the web page regularly to see the newest messages or the client-side should send AJAX requests to the server in short time intervals to retrieve the newest messages. The former of the two is not very user friendly and the latter is a waste of application resources. Then, clearly, we must have a different method to build real-time applications that makes better sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WebSocket provides the solution we need. WebSocket is a communication protocol that allows both the client and server to initiate communication. In other words, with WebSocket, the server can send data to the client any time without the client having to request data first. In the case of the previous messaging application, we can use WebSockets to instantly send messages to all the users through the server. We can use the WebSocket API to communicate using WebSockets when building applications.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="socketio">Socket.io</h2>
<p>However, when implementing a real-time application using Node, we don’t have to directly use the WebSocket API. Instead, Javascript and Node.js library Socket.io,&nbsp; which is an API to the WebSocket API, provides a much simpler implementation of WebSockets for us to use. In this tutorial, we will be using Socket.io to create and manage WebSocket connections between the client and the server.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="building-a-real-time-chatroom-with-nodejs">Building a Real-time Chatroom with Node.js</h2>
<p>Now that we have covered the background on real-time application development, we can start creating our own real-time application. In this tutorial, we are going to build a simple chatroom that users can use to communicate with other connected users. Any number of users can connect to the chatroom and the messages one user sends become instantly visible to all the users connected to the chatroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our simple chatroom is going to have the following set of features.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the username of the user</li>
<li>Send messages</li>
<li>Show if another user is currently typing a message</li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, now that we have our requirements, let’s start building up the environment and setting up the structure</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="setting-up-application-environment">Setting up Application Environment</h2>
<p>First, create a new directory for the application. Then, run <code>the npm init</code> to set up the <code>package.json</code> file. Make sure that, at this step you assign <code>app.js</code> as your main script, if you didn’t , don’t worry, you can always change it in your <code>package.json</code> at a later point.</p>
<h3 id="install-dependencies">Install dependencies</h3>
<p>In this tutorial, we are using the express, ejs, socket.io, and nodemon packages to build the application.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Ejs is a popular JS template engine</li>
<li>We discussed the use of socket.io earlier</li>
<li>Nodemon is a package that restarts the server every time we make a change to the application code. It eliminates the need to manually stop and start the server every time we make a change. Unlike the other packages, we install nodemon as a development dependency since we use it only for development purposes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Install express, ejs, and socket.io using the following command.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm install express ejs socket.io --save
</code></pre></div><p>Install nodemon as a development dependency using this command.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">npm install nodemon --save-dev
</code></pre></div><p>To start the application with nodemon, we should add a start script to our package.json file.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon app.js",
 },
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we can start the application by running the following command on the command-line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it fails, don’t worry, it’s basically because we don’t have any code file yet.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-the-application-structure">Set up the application structure</h3>
<p>With all the dependencies which will need for this project installed, let’s build app the project structure. For that you’ll need to create a few directories and for now, one file called <code>app.js</code>. Let’s get that done so that your app structure looks as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">|--app.js
|--views
|--node_modules
|--package.json
|--public
   |--css
   |--js
</code></pre></div><p>I think the structure is pretty clear, but let’s quickly go over it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app.js</code>: file we will use to host our server-side code</li>
<li><code>views</code>: folder containing the views (ejs)</li>
<li><code>node_modules</code>: where we installed our dependencies</li>
<li><code>package.json</code> npm configuration file</li>
<li><code>public</code>: directory we will use to store our assets, like css files, javascript files (for the client side), and images.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="first-steps-building-the-server">First steps building the server</h2>
<p>The first we need to do before we even consider doing the real-time connections is to get <code>express</code> up and running, for that, let’s open our <code>app.js</code> file and paste the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'express'</span>)
<span>const</span> <span>socketio</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span>(<span>'socket.io'</span>)
<span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span>()

<span>app</span>.<span>set</span>(<span>'view engine'</span>, <span>'ejs'</span>)
<span>app</span>.<span>use</span>(<span>express</span>.<span>static</span>(<span>'public'</span>))

<span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'/'</span>, (<span>req</span>, <span>res</span>)=&gt; {
    <span>res</span>.<span>render</span>(<span>'index'</span>)
})

<span>const</span> <span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>app</span>.<span>listen</span>(<span>process</span>.<span>env</span>.<span>PORT</span> <span>||</span> <span>3000</span>, () =&gt; {

</code></pre></div><p>Once we have <code>express</code> configured and using <code>ejs</code> as template system, we can start working on the sockets.io initialization. For that add the following code at the end of your <code>app.js</code> file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>//initialize socket for the server
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>io</span> <span>=</span> <span>socketio</span>(<span>server</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>The code is pretty straight forward, we are initializing <code>socket.io</code> from our <code>server</code> connection (express) and then we set up an even using <code>io.on()</code> which will be triggered every time a new connection to the socket gets established.</p>
<p>If you now run your server with <code>npm start</code> you will be able to receive new socket connections. So let’s start building our front-end.</p>

<h2 id="building-our-front-end">Building our front-end</h2>
<p>We won’t spend much time making our front-end look amazing, but we will explain how the connection to the server works, how to <code>emit</code> and <code>capture</code> socket events and we will apply all of that into our chat example.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating a template into our views folder, for that create a <code>index.ejs</code> file and paste the following code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I was always interested in the RF world, the fact that we are surrounded by an infinite amount of invisible waves that carry information is intriguing. A lot has changed over the years, the technology advanced and today you can easily dive into the electromagnetic realm without fiddling with mountains of equipment and burning your pocket.</p>
<p>In this post we’ll explore using RTL-SDR to read live temperature and humidity stats from cheap 433.92Mhz modules, feeding them to InfluxDB using rtl_433, MQTT and Telegraf on a Raspberry Pi (but any Linux based device can work)</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR</a></strong></p>
<p>The definition of SDR is “Software Defined Radio”, it’s a radio-communication system where instead of using components that were traditionally implemented in hardware - software is used, allowing greater flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>RTL-SDR is a high quality USB dongle (but relatively cheap at ~$25) that can be used to scan and receive radio signals from 500Khz (24Mhz for the device I used) up to 1.75Ghz. It was designed and built by the awesome dudes over at <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">RTL-SDR.com</a> based on DVB-T TV tuner dongles. I ordered <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011HVUEME/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B011HVUEME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rsv0f-20&amp;linkId=b3bd3c48a6a7e921144609cb59359f0e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> kit which included two modular dipole antennas.</p>

<p>Almost any RF based wireless thermometer / humidity sensor is probably readable by <code>rtl_433</code>. Since we’re talking about cheap hardware you can’t really get any assurances, checking the RF frequency is probably enough - if it says 433.92Mhz, you are 99% good. I’ve used <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33006820989.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1b754c4dDEUyyf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my indoor sensor and <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000872896502.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.419a4c4duApRRx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this</a> as my outdoor, for monitoring my garden soil humidity level and outdoor temperature</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://cubicsdr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">CubicSDR for MacOS</a></strong></p>
<p>This is an awesome free open-source software for SDR. It wasn’t easy finding one for MacOS, most of the commonly-used projects are made for Linux and Windows. It’s not really required for decoding 433.92Mhz signals, but I wanted to get my hands dirty and look on live RF, it’s pretty neat (and of course to test the device is actually working!)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">rtl_433</a></strong></p>
<p>An amazing project that can be used to decode a variety of RF-based devices on various frequencies (433.92 MHz, 868 MHz, 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands). This is the software that does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mosquitto</a></strong></p>
<p>Very simple MQTT server and client implementation, we’ll be using that as the output of rtl_433 and input of Telegraf to stream the metrics to a remote InfluxDB instance.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Telegraf</a></strong></p>
<p>Agent for collecting and writing metrics. It will subscribe to our MQTT queue, parse and transmit the metrics to InfluxDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-signal">Getting a signal</h2>
<h3 id="connecting-the-antennas">Connecting the antennas</h3>
<p>Let’s start by quickly testing our shiny RTL-SDR receiver, I’ve used the two short 5cm dipole telescopic antennas for this test, you should definitely read <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/using-our-new-dipole-antenna-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">this great guide</a> that the awesome dudes over at rtl-sdr.com wrote on using the provided antennas. The antenna used is critical for getting high-quality signal in some cases. For our radio FM test any antenna will probably suffice, but if you want to receive <a href="http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">weather satellite signal running on 137Mhz</a>, you’ll have to be more specific.</p>
<p>Hopefully you’ve ended up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id="listening-to-radio">Listening to radio</h3>
<p>Now you can connect the dongle to your usb port, launch CubicSDR, choose “Generic RTL2832U OEM” and hit “Start”, you can ignore the extra settings you see on the right for now. You should see a pretty moving signal heatmap, you can change the center frequency by hovering over it and tapping space (the key), I chose a local FM radio station that is broadcasting on 88Mhz (FM).</p>
<p>Now your bandwidth setting should be set to 200Khz, you should get a nice signal and when you hover your mouse over it the band will “encapsulate” the signal, click and you should start hearing radio!</p>
<h3 id="checking-frequency-43392mhz">Checking Frequency 433.92Mhz</h3>
<p>Let’s get ready to use <code>rtl_433</code> by looking at the frequency and making sure there are devices there. Usually they will transmit information in 30 second bursts, you can change the center frequency to 433.92Mhz and check that you see data. Near the end of the video above you can see the signal bursts when I switch to 433.92Mhz</p>

			<p>I <a href="https://dormin.org/2020/01/22/the-opium-war-the-war-on-for-drugs/">read and reviewed</a> Oliver Platt’s <strong>Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age </strong>over a year ago, and I haven’t been able to get one small story from the book out of my head.</p>
<p>In 1793, the British government launched the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macartney_Embassy#Voyage_to_China">Macartney Embassy</a>, the nation’s first formal diplomatic mission to China. A few ships led by statesman George Macartney set sail from Portsmouth, England, traveled down to Rio de Janeiro, then around the southern tip of Africa, across the bottom of the Indian Ocean, up through Indonesia, along the Chinese coast, to finally arrive at Beijing. The whole journey took ten months, and the diplomats played cards, drunk tea, looked out for exotic wildlife, and watched crew whippings to forget about being bored out of their minds.</p>
<p>While in the middle of the Indian Ocean, the crew spotted a tiny volcanic island. To their surprise, there were two men on the land desperately waving a makeshift flag in the air to get the crew’s attention. Macartney assumed the men were shipwrecked sailors, and he quickly ordered the ships to stop to lend assistance.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/fc/c3/86fcc396e86c427a43f8f395be187eb3.jpg" alt="Wanna Run and Hide Big Time? Travel to 6 of the World's Remotest ..." width="884" height="585"></p>
<p>On the island, the crew found five men – three Frenchmen and two Americans (from Boston). Surprisingly, they were not shipwrecked, but were living on the island voluntarily under contract with a French merchant company. Their jobs were to harvest seal pelts to sell in Canton, China. They had been alone on the island for <em>six months</em> and had wracked up <em>8,000</em> seal pelts, and they still had another <em>year</em> to go on the contract before the merchant company picked them up.</p>

<p>This seemingly deserted 21-square-mile spit of land, was actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele_Amsterdam">Amsterdam Island</a>, one of the most remote pieces of land on earth, located more than 2,000 miles from the nearest continent. The hunters had managed to create a makeshift village of stone huts and dirt paths on the opposite side of the island from the hunting grounds. But aside from that, there was no settlement, no port, and no other trace of human contact.</p>
<p>Platt doesn’t say why the seal hunters waived the ships down in the first place, but I’m guessing they did so out of boredom. It turns out the hunters didn’t actually need any help or anything else, so after a short but unspecified amount of time (maybe a day at most?), Macartney and the diplomatic mission sailed on.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Orthographic_projection_centred_over_Ile_Amsterdam.png" alt="Orthographic projection centred over Île Amsterdam." width="595" height="594"></p>
<p>That’s insane. The whole situation was insane. Those people were insane. The more I think about this, the more insane it gets.</p>
<p>Five men agreed to live on a deserted 21-square-mile island in one of the most remote places on earth for 1.5 years. Platt doesn’t say whether/how often these men were resupplied during their 1.5-year contract, but given the expense of shipping at the time and the remoteness of the island, I’m guessing they were never resupplied after being dropped off. So they had no man-made goods besides what they initially brought, no housing besides what they made, no toilets or plumbing, and no correspondence with the outside world. They probably only had whatever alcohol and food they brought along except maybe what could be harvested from a small garden and a few animals (though Platt doesn’t mention either). Also, no medical care, so any significant injury could have resulted in death.</p>
<p>And what did these guys do all day on this tiny island in the middle of nowhere? They <em>clubbed and skinned seals</em>… and a lot of them. Let’s do some basic math:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8,000 seals/180 days = 44.44 seals per day</p>
<p>44.44 seals per day/5 men = 8.89 seals per man/per day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So each of these five men woke up every day to bludgeon nine seals to death with clubs (feel free to Google “clubbing seals” for images I don’t want to put here). Then to get the pelts, they skinned these nine seals, which surprisingly only takes about six minutes each according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J47VOCLdFYw&amp;t=524s">this NSFW video</a> (2:52-8:40). And then… that was it for the day. I guess they just lounged around the rest of the time and shot the shit until nightfall.</p>
<p>That’s what these men did. Every day. For 1.5 years, or 18 months, or 548 days. With no human contact beyond the other four men on the island, and I guess the very occasional passing ship. And with no women. And with no technology, amenities, luxuries, or entertainment except what they initially brought. They just got up each day, bludgeoned and skinned nine seals, and then sat around on a deserted island. For 548 days. VOLUNTARILY.</p>
<p>And keep in mind that the five hunters could fail. Any man could get injured and die without medical attention. The trading company could default on the contracts and refuse to pay what was owed. The company could go bankrupt and just not bother picking them up. Slavers from south-east Asia could swing by and make their lives an even worse hell. If the work was commission-based, I wonder if any of the hunters were tempted to murder other ones to claim their pelts…</p>
<p>EDIT – I forgot to mention that it would take about&nbsp;<em>six months&nbsp;</em>for the five men to sail to the island from France, and then another <em>six months </em>to get back to France. So add another year to the isolation for a full accounting of the costs.</p>
<p>I can’t wrap my mind around it. The isolation, the microscopic social circle, the brutal work, the barren terrain, the risk, the long time-frame… it all seems perfectly calculated to make a man go insane.</p>

<p>How much money would you have to be paid to accept their contract? That is, to live on a 21-square-mile island in one of the most remote places on earth, with no contact with the outside world, no amenities except what you initially bring, with four other men (or women if you’re a woman) for 1.5 years to kill and skin seals all day? What would you have to gain to sacrifice that much quality-of-life for that long?</p>
<p>My answer – To agree to such a contract, I think I would need to be financially secure for most or all of the rest of my life. I wouldn’t need to be able to retire to a mansion and a yacht, but I would need to have enough money to at least coast by comfortably on savings + investments for the rest of my years. That would be my price to sustain a rock-bottom quality-of-life, to perform a nauseating job, and to basically sacrifice 1.5 years of my life. I say this as a 28 year old with honestly not that well-developed of a social life.</p>
<p>While the misery of the island life would be bad enough, the biggest cost in my mind is the time, which is something I can’t buy back, especially <em>youthful</em> time. By accepting the contract, I would miss out on 1.5 years of friends, family, romance, sex, entertainment, the entire range of ordinary life experiences, etc. I value that opportunity cost in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>If I absolutely HAD to put a solid price on how much I would have to be paid to go on this expedition, I think I’d say… $2-4 million. Or at least that’s my current price. If I was 40+ years old and time would feel like it moved faster, and if I had no family, my price would come down considerably.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Killing_fur_seals%2C_St_Paul_Island.jpg" alt="Seal hunting - Wikipedia"></p>
<p>How much did the hunters earn for their contract? I don’t know, Platt doesn’t say.</p>
<p>But I’m going to do some research to make an <em>extremely rough</em> estimate. If the hunters collected 8,000 pelts in six months, they should have ended up with 20,000 pelts at the end of their 1.5 year contract. I don’t know if they were paid a lump sum or commissions or something, else, but let’s try to see how much 20,000 seal pelts were worth in the 1790s:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>James L. Clayton’s <a href="http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/40/v40i04p210-220.pdf">“The Growth and the Economic Significance of the American Fur Trade, 1790-1890”</a> puts the price of an Alaskan seal pelt at $5.26 in 1870, and $35.47 in 1890. By <a href="https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1860?amount=35.47">admittedly extreme rough inflation adjustments</a>, those prices in 2020 dollars are $102.95 and $999.37. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any prices from earlier years.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Also from Clayton, between 1870 to 1890 the Alaskan Commercial Company (which had a government-granted near-monopoly on the seal fur trade) harvested over 1,800,000 fur seals at an estimated profit of $18,754,000, or $10.42 per pelt ($293.59 in 2020 when converting from 1890 dollars).</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Callum Roberts’s<strong> <a href="https://books.google.es/books?id=kPUdwlxmda0C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=seal+pelt+prices+1800&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Aa0EFhA0gv&amp;sig=ACfU3U0W376VC1981CgNSgvKgIErob6ZKg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijubrYyL7qAhVHzBoKHZQDDzYQ6AEwCnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=price&amp;f=false">Unnatural History of the Sea</a></strong> says that the over-hunting of seals in the early 1800s collapsed the population to the point where hunters stopped going out to look for seals. Rather, ships would engage in fishing or whaling, but might stop and hunt seals if they were lucky enough to find them. Roberts gives an example of a “fortunate ship” in 1848 getting 7,510 seal pelts in a single outing.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Roberts also says that annual seal production in Alaska (one of the biggest seal producing regions in the world) in the 1860s was 30,000-40,000. After America purchased Alaska, production would increase to 100,000 per year in the 1870s and onward.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_hunting">Wikipedia article on seal hunting</a>: “In 1778, English sealers brought back from the Island of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_Island">South Georgia</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_Strait">Magellan Strait</a>&nbsp;area as many as 40,000 seal skins and 2,800&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_seal">elephant seal</a>”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Not as relevant, but Wikipedia also explains that seal pelt prices today are extremely low because seal fur has been outlawed or heavily regulated in much of the world: “Pelt prices were about [Canadian]$21/pelt in 2010, which is about twice the 2009 price and about 64% of the 2007 price.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above bullet points, 20,000 pelts in 1794 (when the contract ended) were definitely worth a fortune. In 1.5 years, the five seal hunters on Amsterdam Island would produce almost three times as many pelts as a good ship haul in 1848, 2/3rds-1/2 as many pelts as the entire annual production of the Alaskan seal industry in the mid-1800s, and about 1/5<sup>th</sup> the annual production of the Alaskan seal industry in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only prices I have come from 80 and 100 years after 1794, and they’re for Alaskan seal pelts rather than south-Indian Ocean seal pelts, so take this with a colossal grain of salt, but if the prices ARE comparable, then the Amsterdam Island 20,000 seal pelt haul was worth between $2,059,000 and $19,987,400 in inflation-adjusted 2020 USD.</p>
<p>That’s just raw market value. The profit …</p></div></article></div>

It enables interoperability between existing standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dante</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RAVENNA</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-LAN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q-Lan</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livewire_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Livewire</a>.</p>



<h3>Information about AES67</h3>



<p>So how does AES67 actually work? The AES67 Wikipedia page and the AES67 draft from 2017 are a good point to get an overview:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67">Wikipedia Page on AES67</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">AES Standard draft (2017)</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190711055709/http://www.aes.org/standards/comments/drafts/aes67-r-171107-draft-rev-cfc.pdf">archive</a></li></ul>



<p>In summary AES67 consists of three major, already existing standards. The first is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1588-2008.html" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as defined by IEEE 1588-2008</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_Time_Protocol" target="_blank">Precision Time Protocol on Wikipedia</a>) for clock synchronization. The second is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550" target="_blank">Real-time Transport Protocol</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) with 24-bit PCM as the default audio format transmitted via multicast. The third is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566" target="_blank">Session Description Protocol</a> with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2974" target="_blank">Session Announcement Protocol</a> as the transport protocol for session discovery. I suggest to take a look at the standards (sadly IEEE 1588-2008 is behind a paywall) if you want to know how they work, as I won’t be explaining any details here.</p>



<h3>Implementations of the standards</h3>



<p>As the mentioned important standards for AES67 already exists longer than AES67 itself. We do not necessarily need to implement them, as there are already good working implementations out there.</p>



<h4>RTP</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> (also implements PTP and SDP): Open source multimedia framework</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/irtlab/rtptools" target="_blank">rtptools</a>: “set of small applications that can be used for processing RTP data”</li></ul>



<h4>PTPv2</h4>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net/">linuxptp</a>: Implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTPv2) for Linux</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ptpd/ptpd">ptpd/ptpd</a>: Precision Time Protocol daemon</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/philhartung/node-ptpv2" target="_blank">philhartung/node-ptpv2</a>: Javascript implementation of PTPv2</li></ul>

<h3>Open source software</h3>



<p>Even though AES67 has been around for 6 years, there is not a lot of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;q=AES67&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories" target="_blank">open source software for AES67</a> out there. Open source projects that are related to AES67 which I find most interesting are (in no particular order):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">WireGuard</a> is a next generation, cross-platform VPN technology created by Jason A. Donenfeld that has quickly become a popular alternative to the beefy, complex IPSec and SSL VPN solutions used for years. As a testament to its success it has <a href="https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2020-March/005206.html" target="_blank">recently been merged into the Linux Kernel as of v5.6</a>. It is also available as a kernel module or as a user space application written in <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/" target="_blank">Go</a> or <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-rs/about/" target="_blank">Rust</a>. If you are new to WireGuard I recommend checking out the <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#conceptual-overview" target="_blank">conceptual overview</a> as this will be helpful for following along through the rest of the post.</p>

<p>One of the genius parts of WireGuard is its concept of <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/#cryptokey-routing" target="_blank">crypto-key routing</a>. Crypto-key routing defines an association between a public key, and a list of IP addresses (Allowed IPs). The list of IP addresses permits (inbound) and routes (outbound) packets inside of a WireGuard tunnel. This association encompasses the total <em>minimum</em> configuration for a peer, there is no static peer endpoint IP address <em>required</em> from a tunnel validation standpoint. This allows for built-in IP roaming on both sides, assuming peer addresses don’t change simultaneously OR there is a reliable means for signaling when they do.</p>
<p>The DNS can be leveraged to support dynamically addressed peers as various WireGuard utilities will resolve DNS names when configuring a peer, and there are <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/reresolve-dns" target="_blank">supporting scripts</a> that can be used to periodically re-resolve peer addresses. Awesome! This sounds promising… however:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if both peers are behind a NAT that we don’t control? i.e. no static port-forwarding.</li>
<li>How can we discover not only IP addresses but ports? The existing utilities do not support this.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post we will set out to establish a WireGuard tunnel between dynamically addressed peers that are both sitting behind a NAT. One of the primary goals for achieving this is to stick with WireGuard in its purest form, the code that now ships with the Linux Kernel. We do not want to compromise it in any fashion to achieve our goals, although we could get very creative with its user space implementation.</p>

<p>Some of you may be thinking why not use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke%E2%80%93hub_distribution_paradigm" target="_blank">hub-and-spoke model</a>? Surely we can just create tunnels from Alice and Bob to a statically addressed, NAT-free central hub. Alice and Bob can route through the hub.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal/hub_spoke.png" alt="hub_spoke"></p>
<hr>
<p>This is a totally valid approach and one that is widely used today. However, for our use case we are not interested for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>With many peers a hub becomes a vertical scaling bottleneck. (think IoT, connected cars, robotics, etc.)</li>
<li>Sending all of our data through the hub may be costly.</li>
<li>The hub may introduce considerable latency between peers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we’ve outlined the problem, it’s time to dive in. If we are going to establish a WireGuard tunnel directly between Alice and Bob we need to be able to traverse the NATs in front of them. Since WireGuard works over UDP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching" target="_blank">UDP hole punching</a> is our best bet for accomplishing this.</p>
<p>UDP hole punching exploits the fact that most NATs are lenient when matching inbound packets against existing “connections”. This allows us to re-use port state for punching our way back in. If Alice sends a UDP packet to a new host, Carol, and Bob has knowledge of the outbound source IP and port Alice’s NAT used during translation, Bob can reach Alice by sending a UDP packet towards this IP:port pair (<code>2.2.2.2:7777</code> in the illustration below).</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal/hole_punch.png" alt="hole_punch">
<em>* Our hole punching example describes a full-cone NAT. There are limitations with other, less common NAT types where this method does not work</em>.</p>
<hr>

<p>So we now know how UDP hole punching works. Great, but that still leaves us with open questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does Alice discover her external IP:port?</li>
<li>How does Alice communicate this to Bob?</li>
<li>How do we make this work in the context of WireGuard?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389" target="_blank">RFC5389</a> Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) defines a protocol to answer some of these questions. It’s a lengthy RFC, so I’ll do my best to summarize. It’s important to note that STUN is not a drop-in solution to the problem we are trying to solve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STUN by itself is not a solution to the NAT traversal problem. Rather, STUN defines a tool that can be used inside a larger solution.  The term “STUN usage” is used for any solution that uses STUN as a component.</p>
<p>— <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RFC5389<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal/stun.png" alt="stun"></p>
<hr>
<p>STUN is a client/server protocol. In the example above Alice is acting as the client and Carol is the server. Alice sends a STUN Binding request to Carol. When the Binding request passes through Alice’s NAT, the source IP:port gets rewritten. Once Carol receives the Binding request, she copies the source IP:port from the layer 3 and layer 4 headers into the payload of the Binding response and sends it to Alice. The Binding response passes back through Alice’s NAT at which point the destination IP:port gets rewritten, but the payload remains untouched. Alice receives the Binding response and becomes aware her external IP:port for this socket is <code>2.2.2.2:7777</code>.</p>
<p>As previously pointed out, STUN is not a complete solution. STUN provides a mechanism for an application to understand its external IP:port when behind a NAT, but STUN does not provide a method for signaling this to interested parties. If we were writing an application from the ground up that required NAT traversal capabilities, STUN is a component we should consider. We are not writing WireGuard, it already exists, and its not something we can modify (see goal about leaving its source untouched). So where does that leave us? We can certainly take some concepts from STUN and use them to achieve our goal. We clearly need an external, statically addressed host for discovering UDP holes that we can punch through.</p>

<p>Back in August 2016, the creator of WireGuard, shared a <a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/tree/contrib/nat-hole-punching" target="_blank">NAT hole punching PoC/Example</a> on the <a href="https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2016-August/000372.html" target="_blank">WireGuard mailing list</a>. Jason’s example contains a client and server application. The client is intended to be run alongside WireGuard, and the server runs on the statically addressed host for IP:port discovery. The client uses a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/raw.7.html" target="_blank">raw socket</a> for communicating with the server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/* We use raw sockets so that the WireGuard interface can actually own the real socket. */</span>
sock <span>=</span> socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_UDP);
<span>if</span> (sock <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>) {
	perror(<span>"socket"</span>);
	<span>return</span> errno;
}
</code></pre></div><p>As pointed out in the comment, WireGuard owns the “real socket”. By using a raw socket the client is able to spoof the source port used by WireGuard when communicating with the server. This ensures the source IP:port seen at the server will map back to the WireGuard socket on the NAT when punching back in.</p>
<p>The client uses a <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/filter.txt" target="_blank">classic BPF filter</a> on its raw socket for filtering replies from the server destined to the WireGuard port:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>apply_bpf</span>(<span>int</span> sock, uint16_t port, uint32_t ip)
{
	<span>struct</span> sock_filter filter[] <span>=</span> {

		BPF_STMT(BPF_RET <span>+</span> BPF_K, <span>-</span><span>1</span>),
		BPF_STMT(BPF_RET <span>+</span> BPF_K, <span>0</span>)
	};
	<span>struct</span> sock_fprog filter_prog <span>=</span> {
		.len <span>=</span> <span>sizeof</span>(filter) <span>/</span> <span>sizeof</span>(filter[<span>0</span>]),

	};
	<span>if</span> (setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, <span>&amp;</span>filter_prog, <span>sizeof</span>(filter_prog)) <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>) {
		perror(<span>"setsockopt(bpf)"</span>);
		exit(errno);
	}
}
</code></pre></div><p>The data communicated between the client and server is defined in the <code>packet</code> and <code>reply</code> structures:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> {
    <span>struct</span> udphdr udp;
    uint8_t my_pubkey[<span>32</span>];
    uint8_t their_pubkey[<span>32</span>];
} __attribute__((packed)) packet <span>=</span> {
    .udp <span>=</span> {
        .len <span>=</span> htons(<span>sizeof</span>(packet)),
        .dest <span>=</span> htons(PORT)
    }
};
<span>struct</span> {
    <span>struct</span> iphdr iphdr;
    <span>struct</span> udphdr udp;
    uint32_t ip;
    uint16_t port;
} __attribute__((packed)) reply;
</code></pre></div><p>The client works by iterating over the configured WireGuard peers (<code>wg show &lt;interface&gt; peers</code>) and sending a <code>packet</code> to the server for each one. The <code>my_pubkey</code> and <code>their_pubkey</code> fields are populated appropriately. When the server receives a <code>packet</code> from the client, it performs an upsert of an <code>entry</code> against an in-memory table of peers keyed by public key, using the <code>my_pubkey</code> field. It then performs a lookup against the same table using the <code>their_pubkey</code> field. If an <code>entry</code> is found from the second lookup, the peer’s IP:port are sent in a reply to the client. When a reply is received by the client, the <code>ip</code> and <code>port</code> fields are unpacked and the peer’s endpoint address is configured (<code>wg set &lt;interface&gt; peer &lt;key&gt; &lt;options...&gt; endpoint &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>The entry structure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> entry {
	uint8_t pubkey[<span>32</span>];
	uint32_t ip;
	uint16_t port;
};
</code></pre></div><p>The IP and port fields in the <code>entry</code> structure are populated from the IP and UDP headers in the packet received from the client. Each time a client requests the IP and port information for a peer, its own IP and port information is refreshed in the peer table.</p>
<p>The example client and server applications are great examples for how WireGuard can be part of a UDP hole punching solution. We know its possible, so let’s build on this knowledge and move closer to something that is more suited for the real world. Specifically, let’s aim to do this in a way that is cross-platform and does not require a custom wire protocol for IP:port discovery. Our solution should be as simple as possible. Opening a raw socket may not be possible on all of our peers, and we may not be able to leverage BPF filters, either. A custom wire protocol is difficult to debug without custom debugging tools, so let’s use something that is mature with existing, widespread tooling.</p>

<p>In the previous section we explored an example client that used Linux-specific networking features to spoof packets from the socket owned by WireGuard. Instead of building a custom application around WireGuard to open and observe IP:port mappings on a NAT, let’s just use WireGuard. WireGuard tunnels are extremely lightweight, we can simply build a tunnel to our statically addressed peer for IP:port discovery.</p>

<p><i>July 31, 2018</i></p>


<p>
A few persons have asked me about the relative performance
of Julia's native matrices with <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/integers-and-floating-point-numbers/#Arbitrary-Precision-Arithmetic-1">BigFloat</a> elements and <a href="http://arblib.org/">Arb</a> matrices available through <a href="http://nemocas.org/">Nemo.jl</a>.
Unlike machine-precision matrices which build on BLAS technology, BigFloat matrices in Julia use generic code that has not been optimized specifically for BigFloat elements, so we can expect Arb's specialized C implementations to be faster. But by how much?
</p>

<p>
In this blog post, I provide some quick benchmarks done with Nemo 0.8.5 in Julia 0.6.4. 
We take the test matrix $A$ to be the DCT-II matrix of size $N$. This matrix can be constructed as follows as a Julia BigFloat matrix and as a Nemo Arb matrix:</p>

<pre>setprecision(256)
N=10; A = [j == 0 ? 1/sqrt(BigFloat(N)): cos(j*(k+0.5)*BigFloat(pi)/N) * sqrt(BigFloat(2)/N) for j in 0:N-1, k in 0:N-1];
</pre>

<pre>R = ArbField(256)
N=10; A = matrix(R, [j == 0 ? 1/sqrt(R(N)): cos(j*(k+0.5)*R(pi)/N) * sqrt(R(2)/N) for j in 0:N-1, k in 0:N-1]);
</pre>

<p>For these benchmarks, the precision is set to 256 bits, which is the default BigFloat precision in Julia.
The relative performance will be slightly different with higher or lower precision.
I only run the benchmarks with real matrices to keep things brief; complex matrices are about 3-4 times
slower than real matrices with either BigFloat or Arb, so the relative performance
figures should be similar.</p>

<h2>Matrix multiplication</h2>

<p>We time computing <tt>A * B</tt> where <tt>B = transpose(A)</tt>.</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>$N$</th> <th>Julia BigFloat</th> <th>Arb</th> <th>Speedup</th></tr>
<tr><td> 10 </td> <td>0.000310 s</td> <td>0.000112 s</td> <td>2.77</td></tr>
<tr><td> 30 </td> <td>0.00940 s</td> <td>0.00243 s</td> <td>3.87</td></tr>
<tr><td> 100 </td> <td>0.649 s</td> <td>0.0934 s</td> <td>6.95</td></tr>
<tr><td> 300 </td> <td>23.645 s</td> <td>1.151 s</td> <td>20.54</td></tr>
<tr><td> 1000 </td> <td>924.843 s</td> <td>24.606 s</td> <td>37.59</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
Not surprisingly, the <a href="http://fredrikj.net/blog/2018/06/the-arb-matrix-reloaded/">clever matrix multiplication code in Arb</a>
(which uses FLINT behind the scenes)
is leaps and bounds faster than Julia's generic code doing classical matrix multiplication over BigFloats.</p>

<h2>Inverse</h2>

<p>We time computing <tt>inv(A)</tt> which is equivalent to solving the system $AX = I$ in both Arb and Julia.</p>

<p>The overhead inflicted by tracking error bounds in Arb is negligible for matrix multiplication.
However, linear solving switches from straightforward LU factorization to a significantly more
expensive algorithm
using preconditioning
to prevent the error bounds from blowing up exponentially with $N$.
Arb 2.14 introduced separate "approx" functions for
performing a few operations (including LU factorization and solving) <i>without error bounds</i>. 
These functions may be useful as drop-in replacements for the usual numerical Julia functions
when heuristic error estimates are sufficient.
Wrappers for these functions are not yet implemented in Nemo, but it is easy
to write such functions manually in Julia. Here is a wrapper for in-place approximate solving,
and a corresponding approximate matrix inverse function:
</p>

<pre>function approx_solve!(z::arb_mat, x::arb_mat, y::arb_mat)
  r = ccall((:arb_mat_approx_solve, :libarb), Cint,
              (Ref{arb_mat}, Ref{arb_mat}, Ref{arb_mat}, Int),
              z, x, y, prec(base_ring(x)))
  r == 0 &amp;&amp; error("Matrix cannot be inverted numerically")
  nothing
end

function approx_inv(x::arb_mat)
  y = one(parent(x))
  approx_solve!(y, x, y)
  return y
end
</pre>

<p>The table compares performance separately for the rigorous and approx versions:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>$N$</th> <th>Julia BigFloat</th> <th>Arb</th> <th>Speedup</th> <th>Arb (approx)</th> <th>Speedup (approx)</th></tr>
<tr><td> 10 </td> <td>0.000308 s</td> <td>0.000250 s</td> <td>1.23</td> <td>0.000205 s</td> <td>1.50</td></tr>
<tr><td> 30 </td> <td>0.00983 s</td> <td>0.00868 s</td> <td>1.13</td> <td>0.00400 s</td> <td>2.46</td></tr>
<tr><td> 100 </td> <td>0.786 s</td> <td>0.287 s</td> <td>2.74</td> <td>0.111 s</td> <td>7.08</td></tr>
<tr><td> 300 </td> <td>29.018 s</td> <td>4.372 s</td> <td>6.64</td> <td>2.378 s</td> <td>12.20</td></tr>
<tr><td> 1000 </td> <td>1641.659 s</td> <td>84.715 s</td> <td>19.38</td> <td>51.168 s</td> <td>32.08</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>The rigorous algorithm in Arb is barely faster for small $N$ but eventually picks up steam. The approximate version performs even better.</p>

<h2>Matrix exponential</h2>

<p>We time computing <tt>exp(A)</tt> with Arb (note that this gives the matrix exponential and not the elementwise exponential like <tt>exp</tt> applied to a normal Julia array).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Julia's matrix exponential function <tt>expm</tt> does not work with <tt>BigFloat</tt> matrices,
and I'm not aware of any other Julia package that offers such a function except for <a href="http://mpmath.org/">mpmath</a> via PyCall.
So, here is a totally lopsided comparison to <tt>mpmath.expm</tt> (also with 256-bit precision) to have
a point of reference.</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>$N$</th>  <th>mpmath</th>  <th>Arb</th> <th>Speedup</th> </tr>
<tr><td> 10 </td> <td>0.175 s</td>  <td>0.00236 s</td> <td>74.1</td> </tr>
<tr><td> 30 </td> <td>3.762 s</td>  <td>0.0456 s</td> <td>82.5</td> </tr>
<tr><td> 100 </td> <td>145.82 s</td>  <td>1.334 s</td> <td>109.3 </td> </tr>
<tr><td> 300 </td> <td></td>       <td>16.600 s</td> <td></td> </tr>
<tr><td> 1000 </td> <td></td>       <td>337.495 s</td> <td></td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Arb matrices are likely to be slightly faster than Julia's native BigFloat matrices in general, just due to having much less garbage collection and memory allocation overhead.
In addition, Arb matrices are likely to be <i>much</i> faster for large dimensions due to using algorithms based on fast matrix multiplication.
</p>

<p>Should you be using Nemo's Arb matrices instead of BigFloat matrices when 53-bit doubles don't cut it?
If rigorous error bounds are useful, then the answer should be obvious!
Otherwise, the short answer is that it depends.
The benchmark results speak for themselves, but here are two more points to consider:
</p>

<ul>
<li>In practice, Arb may perform worse if the error bounds in ball arithmetic are much more pessimistic than the actual numerical error so that higher precision has to be used. In such scenarios (assuming that rigorous error bounds are not necessary), a perfectly viable alternative to using BigFloats is to work with Arb matrices where one just sets the radii to zero and uses approx methods where available.</li>
<li>Arb matrices currently provide relatively limited functionality (arithmetic, LU factorization, nonsingular solving, inverse, determinant, characteristic polynomial, exponential, and a few more functions) while the Julia standard library has a much wider range of functions (however, not all functions support BigFloats).</li>
</ul>

			<p><span>C</span>onsider Data, the android from <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>. Suppose he finds himself on a hostile planet, surrounded by aliens that are just about to dismantle him. In a last-ditch effort to survive, he quickly uploads his artificial brain onto the Enterprise computer. Does Data survive? And could he, at least in principle, do this every time he’s in a crisis, so that he’d be immortal?</p><p>It is common to assume that an AI could achieve immortality by creating backup copies of itself and thus transfer its consciousness from one computer to the next. This view is encouraged by science-fiction stories. But is it right?</p><p>The question I am asking is whether an AI could achieve what we might call “functional immortality,” uploading and downloading backups long enough to witness the Big Crunch or even be a spectator in the heat death of the universe, the biggest event of them all.</p><blockquote><p>A program, like a mathematical equation, is not a concrete thing that exists in space or time.</p> </blockquote><p>There has been a good deal of discussion concerning the promise and peril of superintelligent AI, a hypothetical form of AI that is smarter than normal humans in every respect: scientific reasoning, mathematical abilities, and more. Science fiction has long depicted superintelligent AIs as being superbeings in another respect as well. Unlike unenhanced humans, who succumb to biological senescence, AIs can achieve functional immortality through uploading and downloading their program. Inching toward omniscience and immortality, AIs become almost Godlike.<br></p><p>Uploading efforts like Data’s will not do the trick, however. Notice that there is an ambiguity as to whether the expression “AI” refers to a particular AI or to a type of AI program. Consider that the expression “the Tesla Model 3” could mean the particular Tesla in your driveway or it could mean the type of car (i.e., the make and model). The type would endure even after your car was dismantled and destroyed. In a similar vein, we can distinguish the particular AI, Data, from the type of program he runs (the Data program, if you will).</p><div>

</div><p>When we are asking about Data’s survival in the above example we are asking about whether this concrete, particular android, Data, can survive until the end of the universe. Data is a particular AI, and as such, he is vulnerable to destruction, just like we are. There may be other androids of this type, but their existence does not ensure the survival of Data, it just ensures that there are other androids that have Data’s <i>type</i> of program.</p><p>Here, one might object that if you copy Data’s program precisely, you haven’t merely made a copy of the Data program—you’ve somehow actually made Data himself, all over again. Data’s mind and consciousness transfer. (Here, I am assuming, for the purpose of discussion, that AIs could, at least in principle, be a conscious being and have a mind, an issue I question in my book <i>Artificial You</i>.)</p><p>This objection relies upon a certain assumption about the nature of the self or mind: the position that the mind (or self) is a software program. You might think that just as you can upload and download a computer file, your mind or self is just a program, and it too can be uploaded and downloaded.</p><blockquote><p>After all, we can tell, by introspecting, that moments pass for us—we are temporal beings.</p> </blockquote><p>This view is deeply mistaken. A program, like a mathematical equation, is not a concrete thing that exists in space or time. Nor does it cause events in the world. It is what philosophers call an “abstract entity.” Of course, an equation or software program can be written down, so you might assume that it is in space and time, but this is to confuse the equation or program (a type) with a mere inscription of it (as philosophers say, a “token”). The inscription is on the page, but the equation or program is not.<br></p><p>It would be very odd if selves and minds turned out to be abstract entities like numbers and programs. After all, we can tell, by introspecting, that moments pass for us—<a href="http://nautil.us/issue/80/aliens/it-may-not-feel-like-anything-to-be-an-alien" target="_blank">we are temporal beings</a>. And our actions cause events in the spatiotemporal world. Abstract entities don’t do anything, and they aren’t anywhere.</p><p>So where does all this leave us? There Data is, on a hostile planet, surrounded by aliens that are about to destroy him. He quickly uploads his artificial brain onto a computer on the Enterprise. Does he survive or not?</p><p>In my view, we now have a distinct instance (a token) of the type of mind, <i>Data</i>, being run by the Enterprise computer. We could ask: Can that particular instance or token survive the destruction of the computer by uploading again (i.e., transferring the mind of that token to a different computer)? No. Again, uploading would merely create a different instance (or token) of the same program type. An individual’s survival depends on where things stand at the token level, not at the level of types. Data, despite his name, is not a program.</p><p>It is also worth underscoring that a particular AI could still live a very long time, insofar as its parts are extremely durable. Perhaps Data could achieve functional immortality by avoiding accidents and having his parts replaced as they wear out. It would be an extraordinary feat to avoid accidents over a period of several billion years, to say the least. (I suppose, at least in principle, a future human could try to do this as well through innovations in biotechnology.) But my view is compatible with this scenario, because Data’s survival in this case does not happen by transferring his program from one physical object to another.</p> <p><i>Susan Schneider is the NASA-Baruch Blumberg chair at the Library of Congress and NASA, and the author of </i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-You-Future-Your-Mind/dp/0691180148/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid;=&amp;sr;=" target="_blank">Artificial You: AI and the Future of the Mind.</a></p><p><i>Lead image originally appeared in “Datalore,” a 1988 episode of</i>&nbsp;Star Trek the Next Generation.</p>

<p>
Common Lisp is a great language.  Of course, it cannot be the best at
everything, it comes with its load of historical idiosyncrasies and it might not
be the language of the future.
</p>

<p>
But there is one aspect of programming in which Common Lisp keeps it first
position after so many years: “interactive programming.”  Only few languages
come close (maybe Racket is one of them).  Interactive programming boosts your
productivity so much that I believe it should always be part of the decision
process when it comes to choosing a language to work with.  Hopefully this
advance in the practice of programming will be remembered when we design the
language of the future.
</p>

<p>
I believe that for this reason alone Common Lisp is worth learning (and using).
</p>

<p>
In the following article, I’m not going to proselytize the language: it’s not
perfect and it won’t suit everyone.  I simply want to give a depiction more
accurate than the common misconceptions about the language, and hopefully help
the curious as well as the experienced user enhance their experience of
programming.
</p>

<ul>
<li>You might be deterred from using Common Lisp for the wrong reasons.  I’m going
to highlight a few of those common “wrong reasons” and if those match yours,
then I believe you ought to give it a try.</li>

<li>Should you want to use Common Lisp, you might be exposed to aged practices or
bad tooling.  In the following I’ll try to catalogue as decent amount of the
most modern advances made in the Common Lisp ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I believe that many negative misconceptions about the language stem from myths
of forgotten times which bear little relevance today.
</p>

<p>
Some common myths include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Lisp does not have compile-time type checking.</li>
<li>Common Lisp is for imperative, object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>Common Lisp is too specialized, it’s not for general-purpose development.</li>
<li>Common Lisp applications are hard to deploy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of these myths subsist today even among Common Lisp developers, simply
because the news of the recent developments in the ecosystem haven’t reached
them.  Indeed, Common Lisp, as an extensible language, has modernized
tremendously over the last decades.
</p>

<p>
Common Lisp is a gigantic programming language and ecosystem.  As such, this
article is in no way exhaustive!  I invite the community to reach out and share
their recommendations, corrections and other discussions!
</p>

<p>
If you enjoy this article and would like to help me keep writing, consider
chipping in, every little bit helps to keep me going&nbsp;:)

<p>
Common Lisp has earned the reputation of being difficult to set up.
Today, some good solutions exist to help newcomers:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://portacle.github.io/">Portacle</a> is an all-in-one bundle that includes <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/slime/slime">SLIME</a> and more.
While the user must learn the basics of Emacs, Portacle is known to be
relatively friction-less.</li>

<li><p>
The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a> package manager can set up a Common Lisp development environment in
one go:
</p>

<div>
<pre>guix install sbcl git emacs emacs-slime emacs-helm-slime emacs-company emacs-magit emacs-paredit emacs-rainbow-delimiters
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Replace <code>guix install</code> with <code>guix environment --ad-hoc</code> if you don’t want to
persist a profile.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer VI-style bindings:
</p>

<div>
<pre>guix install sbcl git emacs emacs-slime emacs-helm-slime emacs-company emacs-magit emacs-paredit emacs-rainbow-delimiters emacs-evil emacs-evil-collection
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you prefer <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/lispy/issues/481">Lispy</a> over paredit to automate s-expression manipulation (such
as automatically balancing parentheses):
</p>

<div>
<pre>guix install sbcl git emacs emacs-slime emacs-helm-slime emacs-company emacs-magit emacs-lispy emacs-rainbow-delimiters
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Should you need Common Lisp libraries, you can also install many of them with
Guix.  For the rest, you’ll have to resort to Quicklisp which is not provided
by Guix, so you’ll have to install it manually:
<a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/</a>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orga1f9c5a">Learning resources</h3>
<div id="text-orga1f9c5a">
<p>
The community-maintained <a href="https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/">Common Lisp cookbook</a> is probably the best starting
point with excellent references to everything from string manipulation to
continuous integration.
</p>

<p>
It’s also a good portal to other resources such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://awesome-cl.com/">awesome-cl</a>: A curated list of Common Lisp frameworks and libraries.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>: A free online book to learn Common Lisp.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That said, the introductory documentation can be rather overwhelming in my
opinion and I’ve invited the community to work on a gentle, modern primer for
the complete beginner:

<h3 id="org30f195f">Local Common Lisp HyperSpec</h3>
<div id="text-org30f195f">
<p>
The HyperSpec is the Common Lisp reference available here:
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm</a>.
</p>

<p>
While the website look is rather dated, SLY and SLIME will interface with it so
that you can browse the specifications directly from Emacs without having to
open a browser.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the HyperSpec can be installed locally, to be consulted
offline.  See <a href="http://quickdocs.org/clhs/">http://quickdocs.org/clhs/</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is also a Guix package for it available from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix">Nonguix</a> channel, and it’s
also available in <a href="https://zealdocs.org/">Zeal</a>.  (Thanks to /u/dzecniv for sharing this one.)

<h3 id="orgfb9af9c">SLIME vs. SLY</h3>
<div id="text-orgfb9af9c">
<p>
SLY is a fork of SLIME.  SLIME tends to be more conservative while SLY is slightly
more featureful.
</p>

<p>
A few benefits of SLY over SLIME:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It has more consistent, cleaner code and reuses more of Emacs facilities (like
<code>comint-mode</code> for the REPL).</li>
<li>It has a better color theme in my opinion.</li>
<li>It offers better fuzzy completion.</li>
<li>A feature unique to SLY: stickers allow the user to “stick” non-persistent
code to help with debugging by annotating it.
See <a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/sly#stickers">https://github.com/joaotavora/sly#stickers</a>.</li>
<li>The setup is essentially zero-config with sane defaults, with all the features like mrepl,
stickers, etc. enabled by default.  Of course you can disable the features you
don’t like.</li>
<li>It compiles with ASDF which makes it easier to package, bundle or deploy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
SLIME does include some features that are only available in SLY as plugins, such
as ASDF management.  I recommend the following plugins for SLY:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mmgeorge/sly-asdf">sly-asdf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/sly-quicklisp">sly-quicklisp</a></li>

<h3 id="org6019073">SLIME / SLY tips and tricks</h3>
<div id="text-org6019073">
<p>
Check out the following not-so-well-known commands, they could dramatically
improve your workflow!  (Most of them have a SLY equivalent.)
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>slime-who-*</code></li>
<li><code>slime-eval-last-expression-in-repl</code> (<code>C-c C-j</code>)</li>
<li><code>slime-list-compiler-notes</code></li>
<li><code>slime-export-symbol-at-point</code> (<code>C-c x</code>)</li>
<li><code>slime-export-class</code>, <code>slime-export-structure</code></li>
<li><code>slime-trace-dialog-toggle-trace</code> (<code>C-c M-t</code>)</li>
<li><code>slime-inspect-definition</code></li>
<li><code>slime-delete-system-fasls</code> (Useful when .fasls are out-of-sync)</li>
<li><code>slime-repl-clear-buffer</code> (<code>C-c M-o</code>: useful when <code>lispy</code> or <code>paredit</code> goes berserk)</li>
<li><code>slime-profile-package</code>, then run the desired functions, then
<code>slime-profile-report</code>.</li>
<li><code>hyperspec-lookup-format</code> and <code>hyperspec-lookup-reader-macro</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In particular, note that <code>slime-who-specializes</code> lists the methods of a given
class, which answers a common complaint coming from people used to languages
from the Algol family: the ability to complete the methods of the <code>foo</code> class by
typing <code>foo.&lt;TAB&gt;</code>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc96c232">
<h2 id="orgc96c232">ASDF</h2>
<div id="text-orgc96c232">
<p>
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/">ASDF</a> is the de-facto standard build system for Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
To use a <code>FOO</code> system, place it in in <code>~/common-lisp</code> and call
<code>(asdf:load-system :FOO)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Better: from the SLIME or SLY REPL, press <code>,load-system</code> and you’ll be provided
with a list of systems that can be loaded.
</p>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-org9642c78">
<h3 id="org9642c78">Inferred systems</h3>
<div id="text-org9642c78">
<p>
Historically ASDF required you to explicitly list the files to compile.  This
was cumbersome and error-prone, but thankfully it has been fixed some time ago
with the <code>package-inferred-system</code> extension which I highly recommend:
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension.html#The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension">https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension.html#The-package_002dinferred_002dsystem-extension</a>
</p>

<p>
Benefits:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to list files.</li>
<li>No need to list dependencies.
With non-inferred-systems, the dependency list can be wrong, e.g. include too
many of them or miss some.  In that sense inferred-systems are more robust.</li>
<li>Enforces that every file must be a package.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Trick:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If your system has many files, and thus that many packages, it can get quickly
cumbersome for the user to load all those packages one by one.  Instead, you
can create a “meta package” which imports all the other packages of your
system, so that the user only has to load this one to access the whole system.</li>

<li><p>
How can we get the list of dependencies since we don’t list them explicitly in
the <code>.asd</code> anymore?  Thankfully the snippet below will retrieve them
programmatically for us:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(declaim (ftype (function (string) list) package-dependencies))
(defun package-dependencies (pkg-name)
  (let (depends)
    (labels ((iter (openlist)
	       (if (null openlist) depends
		   ;; is this a subsystem of foo?
		   (let ((find (search  pkg-name (first openlist))))
		     (if (and find (zerop find))
			 (iter (append (asdf:system-depends-on (asdf:find-system (first openlist))) (rest openlist)))
			 ;; if not, it's a direct dependency: collect it
			 (progn
			  (pushnew (first openlist) depends :test 'equalp)
			  (iter (rest openlist))))))))
      (iter (list pkg-name)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(package-dependencies "dbus")
; =&gt; ("ironclad cl-xmlspam split-sequence flexi-streams ieee-floats iolib babel trivial-garbage alexandria
</pre>
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>

Myth: Common Lisp is old and does not enjoy the features of modern languages
from recent years.
</p>

<p>
Truth: While the Common Lisp standard is from the 1990s, many modern libraries
have continuously updated the language.
</p>

<p>
One of the biggest selling points of Common Lisp (and Lisp languages in general)
is that the language itself is extensible.  This means that if new paradigms
become fashionable, they can easily be added to the language.
</p>

<p>
In particular, Common Lisp has the reputation among functional programmers of
being very imperative and object-oriented.  While these styles were popular
in the past, nothing prevents us from programming functionally in Common Lisp.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>C++ <code>Iterator</code> is an abstract notion which identifies an element of a sequence. A sequence could be anything that are connected and sequential, but not necessarily consecutive on the memory. C++ <code>Iterator</code> could be a raw pointer, or any data structure which satisfies the basics of a C++ <code>Iterator</code>. It has been widely used in C++ STL standard library, especially for the <code>std</code> containers and functions.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to implement C++ <code>Iterator</code> using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Nested-Class/">nested class</a> inside a certain sequence container class for generic programming.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>In this example, we would like to apply different sequence data structures, including <code>std::list</code>, <code>std::array</code>, <code>std::vector</code>, and a custom dummy vector class <code>DummyVector</code>, to the custom template function <code>maximum</code> and the <code>std</code> function <code>std::max_element</code>, which take in two <code>Iterator</code> instances and return an <code>Iterator</code> instance, to find out the maximum value in the sequence. Since <code>std</code> containers have already implemented the <code>Iterator</code>s for us, we would just use <code>DummyVector</code> as an example for how to implement class-specific nested <code>Iterator</code> class while making it generic by satisfying the <code>Iterator</code> abstract notions.</p>



<p>According to the C++ standard, an iterator must provide the overloading for <code>*</code>, (prefix) <code>++</code>, <code>==</code>, and <code>!=</code>. For completeness, I also implemented (postfix) <code>++</code>, (prefix) <code>--</code>, and (postfix) <code>--</code>, since some custom template function, such as our <code>maximum</code> function, might use these operators as well without following the exact C++ standard.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>If we have a custom sequence container class, and we want to take the advantage of the existing C++ STL algorithm <code>std</code> template functions, we could just implement the <code>Iterator</code> for the custom sequence container class. This container class would then be compatible with all the C++ STL algorithm <code>std</code> template functions. This is an extremely good example of the C++ generic programming concept.</p>

As an added advantage, the accuracy of the reported metrics for my website has improved by 30-40%.</section></header><div><article><p>Google analytics has been my go-to analytics tool ever since I became a web
developer a few years ago. It’s the de-facto standard for website usage tracking
and is free to use, feature-rich and easily accessible on web and mobile.
However, over the last couple of months, I contemplated moving away from the
service for some reasons.</p><p>My first gripe with Google Analytics is that the interface is quite slow and
confusing to use. It’s a busy interface and I always have to fumble around to
find the relevant metric I’m looking for. The mobile app is much better in this
regard at least in terms of speed.</p><p>I also realised that I wasn’t even using up to 10% of the features provided by
the service. For the most part, all I cared about is the number of visitors,
page views, and where visitors are coming from (search engines, social media
e.t.c.) so all the other metrics that Google collects are not important for me.</p><p>Due to this reason, I felt it wasn’t an acceptable trade-off to load the 19 KB
tracking script just to view basic website statistics. When decompressed, the
analytics script is about 46 KB which is just extra work for the browser to parse
and execute and for not a lot of gain in the context of my needs.</p><p>Another major issue is privacy. Google Analytics is free to use (for up to 10
million hits per month), but it’s only because the company recoups the cost of
running the service by using the aggregated data to track users for the purpose
of showing personalised ads.</p><p>As a result, the analytics script is often blocked by ad blockers and other anti
tracking extensions including those built into browsers such as Firefox, Brave,
and Vivaldi meaning that the reported statistics aren’t all that accurate
especially for sites with tech-savvy audiences like mine.</p><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/2020-07-11_15-29_4uwx2G2QGhq.jpg" alt="Firefox blocks Google Analytics"><figcaption><p>Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection blocks Google Analytics</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="evaluating-alternatives">Evaluating alternatives</h2><p>Quite a few Google Analytics alternatives have emerged recently with many
beginning to recognise that Google has way too much influence on the web and also
because of the usability issues discussed above.</p><p>My main criteria for a replacement was that it should be privacy-respecting,
lightweight and easy to use with a good balance of features. I found some
discussions on Hacker News on alternatives to Google Analytics and proceeded to
check out some of the suggestions.</p><p><a href="https://goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> was the first option I looked into. It
ticks most of the boxes and is fully open-source, easy to self-host and has a
sane pricing model but I was not in love with the <a href="https://stats.arp242.net/">user
interface</a> of the metrics dashboard. Another option
was <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>, but it’s proprietary and
too expensive for me at $19/month for ~100k views monthly.</p><p>Eventually, it came down to a choice between <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>
and <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>. They both have a similar feature set, a
good user interface to view my stats, and lightweight tracking scripts. I
decided to go with Plausible in the end.</p><p>It mostly came down to pricing (Plausible starts at $12/month for ~100k views
with a 33% discount if billed annually), and the fact that the
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics">codebase</a> is fully open source and
supports
<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/HOSTING.md">self-hosting</a>
without restrictions. On the other hand, Fathom starts at $14/month for the same
amount of views and the V2 of the service is no longer open source. They have a
<a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Lite version</a> on GitHub, but it’s clear
from the Readme file that they don’t want anyone to use it.</p><h2 id="switching-to-plausible">Switching to Plausible</h2><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/47xns5_KMt4Autrod_.jpg" alt="Switching from Google Analytics to Plausible"></figure><p>I decided to take advantage of Plausible’s generous 30-day trial to try out the
service and get a feel for how it works. Their tracking script is one of the
lightest out there coming in at around 834 bytes (1.3 KB uncompressed) which is
more than 20 times lighter than <abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr>'s
tracking script.</p><p>After adding the script to my site, the analytics began to show up almost
immediately. The <a href="https://plausible.io/plausible.io">dashboard</a> interface is
quite polished and supports all of the basic metrics such as page views and
unique visitors, browser and operating system statistics, device screen sizes,
locations, and referrer information.</p><figure><img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/2020-07-11_15-21_Mbda6pDzVby.jpg" alt="Plausible user interface"><figcaption><p>Plausible’s dashboard interface is visually polished and easy to use</p></figcaption></figure><p>It also supports event tracking, weekly or monthly email reports, and the
ability to proxy the tracking script through a custom domain which can be quite
handy because some browsers and extensions block all analytics services
including privacy-friendly ones.</p><p>I decided to run Plausible side by side with Google Analytics for a few days
just to see how the reported stats compare. Unsurprisingly, Plausible’s
reporting for page views was consistently about 30-40% higher presumably because
<abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> is blocked by some clients. <abbr title="Google Analytics">GA</abbr> is gone for good now though.</p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>The experience of switching away from Google Analytics to Plausible was
painless and I’m really happy with how it turned out so far. I think both
Plausible and Goat Counter are excellent choices for anyone looking for a
privacy friendly alternative to Google Analytics. The former just has a bit more
visual polish while the latter is significantly easier to self-host but you
really can’t go wrong with either.</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p><section><li><a href="https://freshman.tech/tags/privacy">#privacy</a></li><li><a href="https://freshman.tech/tags/analytics">#analytics</a></li></section></article></div></section></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The secret to building long term wealth is a simple tool that has been around for ages. <br><strong>The secret to wealth is optimizing your personal balance sheet.</strong></p><h2>You mean a budget?</h2><p>No, not a budget but I can understand why you would think so. For a very long time, those in the personal finance realm have touted a budget as the sure-fire way to manage your money in a way that will allow you to build wealth. But it isn’t working.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fewer-americans-are-budgeting-in-2019----although-they-think-everyone-else-should-300824384.html">70% of Americans </a>have a budget but only <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html">60% of us </a>could cover a $400 emergency expense! So all of that budgeting isn’t even allowing us to cover a relatively inexpensive emergency expense, never mind build any kind of long-term wealth.</p><h2>What a budget does&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>A budget to us as individuals is very similar to a profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) to a business.</strong> A P&amp;L is a summary of the revenue (a fancy term for sales), cost, and expenses incurred for a specific period of time. It gives information about whether or not the company can make a profit by increasing revenue, cutting costs, or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For us, as individuals, our revenue is our income, our costs are our necessary expenses (housing, transport, insurance, etc), and our expenses are our discretionary expenses (food, clothing, entertainment, etc). Our specific period of time is typically one month. </p><p>These functions are important.<strong> </strong>You need to know how much money is coming in, how much is going out, and where that money is going and a budget shows you that. But a budget is missing some pretty critical information if your goal is to build wealth.</p><blockquote>A budget is missing some pretty critical information if your goal is to build wealth.</blockquote><h2>What a balance sheet does (for a business)?</h2><p>A balance sheet shows a company’s assets &amp; liabilities and shows how effectively a company’s management team uses the company’s resources.&nbsp;</p><p>Assets include cash and cash equivalents, liquid assets like Treasury bills, accounts receivable and inventory. </p><p>Liabilities include short and long-term debts, lease/rent commitments, accounts payable, etc. </p><p>Shareholder’s equity is equal to a company’s total assets minus its total liabilities. It is the amount that would go back to shareholders if a company’s assets were liquidated and its debts paid off. <strong>Shareholder’s equity is one of the markers indicating how financially healthy a company is.&nbsp;</strong>‍</p><p>Did you spot the missing information? For us, our assets are things like our investment accounts and the equity in our homes, our liabilities are our debts, <strong>and shareholder’s equity is our net worth.</strong></p><p>A balance sheet contains this critical information while a budget does not. </p><h2>But you’re not a business</h2><p>You are though! Your personal finances are a business, the business of you. Money comes in, money goes out, you have assets, you have liabilities and you have a net worth. Would a business be successful if it just tracked what money came in, what money went out, and where the money was going? </p><p>Businesses use a balance sheet to show <strong>a much more complete picture of their finances</strong> and you should too. A balance sheet gives you that 1,000-foot overview of your financial health, providing much more data than a budget can provide.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2>What gets measured gets managed</h2><p>A balance sheet will show your net worth.<strong> </strong>Net worth is your total assets minus your total debts or liabilities. A budget doesn’t show any assets, just your monthly income. Here is an example:</p><ul role="list"><li>Assets: $240,000</li><li>Debts: $130,000</li><li>Net Worth: +$110,000</li></ul><p>If you have more debt than you have assets, you can have a negative net worth. <strong>Net worth is arguably the most important number in personal finance. Here are 4 reasons why you should track your net worth.</strong>‍</p><h3>1. Focus on increasing the value of your assets</h3><p>Assets can include equity in other people's business (stocks), giving loans to companies &amp; governments (bonds), equity in your own business (founder equity), income generating real estate, etc.</p><blockquote>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. - <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103670400417792">@naval</a></blockquote><h3>2. Avoid anxiety and knee-jerk decisions</h3><p>The stock market crashes by 20% and you start feeling anxious. You are tempted to sell and get out. <strong>Your mind tricks into believing that <em>everything</em> is going to zero. </strong>You come back and check your net worth. You notice there is only a slight change in your net worth because stocks were only a part of your overall portfolio. </p><p>You avoid a costly mistake.</p><h3>3. Keeps you motivated</h3><p>Month to month you might see small changes, but over a long period of time, you’ll see <strong>how your delayed gratification sacrifices have added up.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>It feels validating.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Shows when you are ready to retire</h3><p>The simplest and most obvious reason to track your net worth is to find out when you are ready to retire. Typically, you can live off of 4% of your total investments safely for a 30-year retirement. A simple way to calculate your target number is to look at how much you want to live on per year and multiply by 25. For example, say you want to live on $100,000 a year, $100,000 x 25 = $2.5M. Once you have that invested, you are ready to retire!&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what is the secret to long term wealth? <br>‍<strong>Tracking your net worth and doing something about it every month, every year. </strong></p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Kubera helps you protect your wealth by keeping track of your net worth and storing important documents.

Your mind absorbs the information you feed it, whether it’s good or bad. </span></p><p id="viewer-10dj"><span>Everything you do - the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/why-you-should-forget-your-passion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>career</u></span></a><span> you pursue, the </span><a href="https://www.keaganstokoe.com/post/the-biggest-decision-you-ll-ever-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>partner</u></span></a><span> you pick, the company you build - starts with a thought. That's why improving the way you think, improves the way you do everything. It’s difficult to think well when the sponge in your head is only exposed to the information at the front of the buffet.  </span></p><p id="viewer-d7f2p"><span>My company prioritises independent thinking. Regardless of what you’re doing, you're encouraged to think creatively and independently. That ethos, and the creativity that results from it, is the reason a small South African company is being invited to work with places like Harvard and MIT. It’s the reason we’re making waves in education - an industry that hasn't seen much progress in over a century.</span>

</p><p id="viewer-8svl6"><span>The world needs people who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for a country, for a company, and for those around them. People with a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision. </span>

</p><p id="viewer-f91mr"><span>But thinking for yourself is difficult. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Copernicus</u></span></a><span> realised the sun didn't go around the earth when traditional wisdom, everyone around him, and even the evidence of his senses said that it did. The idea was such a stretch that even he had a hard time believing it. He was forced into believing it because it was the only way the numbers made sense. </span></p><p id="viewer-7vfqr"><span>Everyone tried to talk him out of his idea. It happened in the 1400s, and it happens today. Society encourages conformity, and you’re ridiculed for having ideas that don’t fit into the box that society operates in. It’s important to reject the urge to conform, because what society wants for you is not always what’s good for you. </span></p><p id="viewer-fggmj"><span>The world is desperate for people who think creatively, independently and flexibly. They’re the creators, inventors and innovators. The people that drive progress and make the world a better place. The people that steer us in the right direction as the world changes faster and faster each day. </span></p><p id="viewer-6k5gg"><span><strong>DEFENDING AGAINST A BLAZING FIRE</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-20kp1"><span>During a scorching heatwave, when crops catch fire, a circle is drawn around the blaze and the crops in that circle are deliberately set alight before the flames can reach it.

<p><em><strong>If you are having difficulty discovering your purpose in life, start by defining your favorite problems.</strong></em></p>



<p>We often feel lost in life when we lack purpose. Traditionally, we have been trained to rely on our ideas, our passions, and our skills to find direction. While this puts us on track to find <em>something</em>, this mindset is horrendously inadequate and inefficient in discovering purpose.</p>



<p>We all have ideas. We all have a purpose. Some of us lack the former and most of us lack the latter. In either case, we must work <em>systematically</em> to discover these and form a cohesive connection between the two. And by systematically, I mean implementing a set of selective filters that will take us from <em>idea</em> to <em>purpose </em>with precision and effectiveness.</p>







<h3><strong>A System of Filters</strong></h3>



<p>Most ideas are just plain bad. Some are good. And very few are great. Your objective is to find those great ideas which serve your life’s purpose. An effective way to approach this is to first <strong>define your favorite problems</strong>. You might think it’s an odd way of referring to your problems. But this filter is absolutely critical to the process.</p>



<p>Here is Richard Feynman, a Nobel-Prize winning physicist, describing it in his typical playful and observational style:</p>



<p><em>“You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while, there will be a hit, and people will say, ‘How did he do it? He must be a genius!”</em></p>



<p>Think of your favorite problems as a set of receptors. They take in information, sort it into relevant applications, and allow you to apply your ideas in a much more focused way to achieve your purpose.</p>



<p>But this alone is not sufficient. What good is your “favorite problems” filter if you are throwing any and every idea at it like a blindfolded dart-thrower? Therein lies the need for a preceding filter: asking better questions.</p>



<p>A set of specific and useful questions is the filter through which you will examine your ideas. You may not be actively thinking about the questions you are asking on a day-to-day basis, but every action you take, every decision you make, and every cake you bake (sorry, I had to…) is in some form generated by a question.</p>



<p>When you combine the two filters of <em>questions</em> and <em>problems</em>, you will have a robust vetting system in place for your ideas.</p>



<h4>Here are a couple basic examples as a warm-up:</h4>



<p><strong>Business</strong></p>



<p>When a restaurant manager envisions building an efficient and seamless operation, she must begin by identifying the problems that will prevent her from achieving it.</p>



<ul><li>She has many <strong>ideas</strong> on how it can be achieved, so she begins to ask <strong>questions</strong> that define her <strong>problems</strong>.</li><li>One of her problems might be in hiring, so she asks herself “how can I construct a reliable and repeatable hiring process that is effective in identifying the best candidate?”</li><li>She vets her ideas through the questions she asks. The questions inform the problem. And through acute awareness of the problem, she is able to achieve her<strong> purpose</strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>



<p>You want to achieve financial freedom (<strong>purpose</strong>).</p>



<ul><li>You have an <strong>idea</strong> to go on Indeed and apply for the highest paying job you can find. Conventional wisdom applauds this approach. You’re beginning to see why it’s all wrong.</li><li>By implementing your filters, you start to ask <strong>questions</strong> like: “how can I develop an income stream that will allow me to achieve financial freedom in 5-10 years?” (Remember: specific and useful)</li><li>By asking the right question relative to your purpose, you identify the <strong>problem </strong>in achieving your goal of financial freedom: <em>Indeed is useful for stacking the odds against you for jobs with a finite yearly salary.</em> Hardly the most effective way to reach your goal.</li><li>Due to your effective filters, you save yourself the headache of implementing your bad ideas, and you begin to think of better ideas that will serve your ultimate purpose!</li></ul>



<p>Here is an easy way to visualize the process:</p>

Whatever you do, this method will change the way you approach your biggest problems.</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>Identifying Your 12 Favorite Problems Through Effective Questions</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s now apply this method to discovering your life’s purpose. In this case, you are starting from incomplete information: you lack purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, start by identifying your favorite problems. These are problems you often think about, which could be related to any of your deepest interests, skills, and passions. These are problems that inspire you and captivate you, ones that go beyond the scope of day-to-day problems. Write these down. Make them specific enough to be actionable, yet broad enough to think about them for years to come. To give you an idea:</p>



<ul><li>“What is the meaning of life?” = Too broad</li><li>“What is the weather going to be like tomorrow?” = Too specific, and useless in the grand scheme of things.</li><li>“How can I surround myself with optimistic, curious, and supportive people who give me energy?” (Courtesy of David Perell) = This is the realm you want to be in.</li></ul>



<p>If your questions are precise and relevant to your favorite problems, you will have a more direct path to discovering your purpose. Begin a habit of consciously formulating and referring back to your questions. You will miss the mark often (see dotted arrows above), but that is all part of the learning process. The more deliberate and thoughtful you are in this process, the closer you will be to achieving the life you want to live.</p>

<p>For the last 15 years of my working life, I have wandered aimlessly, jumping from job to job, curiosity to curiosity, and never focusing my energies in one primary direction. I haven’t quite found my true purpose yet, but with this system, I am more on the path than I have ever been in my entire life.</p>



<p>If you want to begin a more deliberate approach to discovering your purpose, it helps to have an example to gain inspiration. Here are my 12 favorite problems, divided my scope:</p>



<h4><strong>30-Foot View (The Scope of My Daily Life)</strong></h4>



<p>1. <strong>Am I hunting antelope or chasing mice?</strong> This question originated from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This helps me refocus on my priorities when I get bogged down in minutiae. Every action I take is put through this filter to ensure that I am consistently effective in the most relevant areas.</p>



<p>2. <strong>How can I balance my time between cultivating meaningful relationships and meaningful work?</strong> I put this tweet out recently, which sums up my passion for what I’m currently building:</p>



<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>When you do unfulfilling work, 8 hrs/5x a week is full-time.</p><p>When you do meaningful, self-directed work, 16 hrs/7x a week feels like part-time.</p></div>— Joe Balcom (@thejoebalcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/thejoebalcom/status/1280164045744734208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>While I’ve finally found a meaningful path worth travelling, I still struggle to make time for those closest to me. Perhaps this will solve itself as I become more efficient in my work, but tomorrow is never guaranteed. It must be a priority.</p>



<p>3. <strong>How can I overcome the tyranny of perfectionism?</strong> Even as I write this post, I am suffering from the effects of perfectionism. I constantly check and recheck my work, just to make sure everything is “perfect.” Eventually, I let my work out into the world, but not after hours of painstaking attention to detail.</p>



<p>4. <strong>How can I find my 1,000 True Fans?</strong> Anyone trying to build an online business should read <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">this article by Kevin Kelly</a>. The intimidation level of building something that sells is immense. This article is so good at lowering it and making you feel that your goals are well within reach.</p>



<p>5.  <strong>What is the least crowded channel?</strong> I’ve asked this question to myself for over a decade. It is why I’m done submitting resumes, it’s why I didn’t get a master’s degree (I didn’t catch myself in time for undergrad), and it is why I’ve been able to identify entry points to otherwise “inaccessible” leadership positions and unique adventures. It is why you are reading this today.</p>



<p>6. <strong>What would this look like if it were easy?</strong> Thanks to Tim Ferriss for this one. This is particularly useful when overwhelmed, frustrated, or intimidated. When I first became a restaurant manager, it was easy to get lost in the  million tasks I needed to get done. By asking this question, I was able to devise a <strong>system</strong> for reducing stress and achieving my goal in a more effective way.</p>

<h5>Travel</h5>



<p>7. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of travel</em>—to help people aim for <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">meaningful exploration</a> rather than frivolous luxury?</p>



<p>8. How do I articulate the importance and, dare I say, <em>necessity</em> of travel in a compelling and persuasive way?</p>



<h5>Work</h5>



<p>9. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of work</em>—to look at it through the lens of <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/30/work-on-purpose/">meaningfulness instead of working by default</a> (for money, approval, necessity)?</p>



<p>10. How can I shepherd people into the age of leverage and teach people that a prosperous future is in <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/08/destiny/">divorcing their time from their income</a>?</p>



<h5>Mind</h5>



<p>11. How can I help change the <em>paradigm of mental health</em>—to look at it through the lens of community and togetherness, rather than through shame and secrecy?</p>



<p>12. How can I inspire and teach people in a convincing way how to overcome self-imposed limitations—to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/forcing-function/">not just step outside their comfort zone, but to demolish it altogether</a>?</p>



<hr>



<h3>If Nobody Calls Your Vision Arrogant…</h3>



<p>These questions aren’t perfect, and will probably adjust over time. But they serve as a way to focus my energies in the most effective directions, and get closer to my true purpose than ever before.</p>



<p>I hope this helps you begin to formulate your approach to life in a more thoughtful way. Having things written down, illustrated, and listed will free your mind. You will have the mental lightness to move forward and towards a defined goal with …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Pop quiz: Which country inflicted the most Nazi casualties in WW2?</p>



<p>Would it surprise you to learn that the answer is the Soviet Union… and that USA is not even a close second? That even British historians considered the Red Army to be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/the-soviet-union-helped-save-the-world-from-hitler-a7020926.html" target="_blank"><em>“the main engine of Nazism’s destruction”</em></a>?</p>



<p>To <a href="http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/stalins-victory-the-soviet-union-and-world-war-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote an Irish historian and expert on this subject</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>When World War II ended in 1945 few doubted that the victor’s laurels belonged mainly to Joseph Stalin… Eighty per cent of all the combat of World War II took place on the Eastern Front… During the four years of the Soviet–German struggle the Red Army destroyed 600 enemy divisions. The Germans suffered ten million casualties (75% of their total wartime losses)</em></p><p><em>In comparison, the contribution of Stalin’s western allies to the defeat of Germany was of secondary importance. Even after the Anglo-American invasion of France in June 1944 there were still twice as many German soldiers serving on the Eastern Front as in the West</em></p></blockquote>

<p>If the above caught you off guard, you aren’t alone. I too was certainly surprised, as are most people today. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/16/5814270/the-successful-70-year-campaign-to-convince-people-the-usa-and-not" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a poll of the French public</a>, 57% of the French in 1945 credited the USSR with the biggest contribution to Nazi defeat in Europe, and only 20% credited the USA (despite the fact that the USSR never set foot in France and USA had liberated it). But by 1994, the sentiment had completely flipped – only 25% still credited the USSR, and 49% now credited the USA. And the numbers kept growing. By 2004, USSR’s share dropped to 20%, and USA’s had grown to 58%.</p>



<p>The truth had travelled halfway around the world, but only because the lie was still putting on its shoes.</p>



<p>It is popularly assumed that the truth will always win the day. As the old saying goes <em>“you cannot fool all the people, all the time”</em> (ironically enough, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/12/11/cannot-fool/" target="_blank">this saying itself is falsely attributed to Lincoln</a>). Perhaps this is indeed the case where expert opinion is concerned. But if there’s one thing we can learn from history, it is that public opinion is a whole other beast. Driven more by fiction than fact.</p>



<h2><strong>Narrative Plentitude</strong></h2>



<p><em>“Driven more by fiction than fact.”</em> Certainly sounds like colorful phrasing, but it goes beyond that. It is actually a pretty accurate description of how our minds work. With great training and concerned effort, we sometimes use quantitative data and logical analysis in order to guide our thought process and decision making. But this is the exception, not the norm.</p>



<p>Most of the time, and certainly for most people, our thoughts are guided by narratives. Stories. Our brains are intrinsically wired to look toward stories, in order to make sense of the world around us.</p>



<p>To quote <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/08/life-stories-narrative-psychology-redemption-mental-health/400796/" target="_blank">Professor Adler</a>, <em>“the default mode of human cognition is a narrative mode.”</em></p>



<p>Or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/health/psychology/22narr.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Adams</a>, <em>“these narratives guide behavior in every moment, and frame not only how we see the past but how we see ourselves in the future.”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/health/psychology/22narr.html">Or the NYTimes</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>researchers have found that the human brain has a natural affinity for narrative construction. People tend to remember facts more accurately if they encounter them in a story rather than in a list, studies find; and they rate legal arguments as more convincing when built into narrative tales rather than on legal precedent.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In fact, there is an entire psychology heuristic/bias that is premised on this. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">Availability Heuristic</a>. A finding by psychologists that when evaluating any topic, we rely heavily not on statistics, but any immediate examples that come to mind.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>If something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Executing the Hack</strong></h2>



<p>Stories are certainly great in many respects. They are rich in color, vividly detailed, and offer a wealth of information in a microcosm. But in other ways, they are utterly lacking. In a world of seven billion humans, there are hundreds of billions of stories. With diametrically opposing heroes, villains, and conclusions. Each story offers “<em>a”</em> truth, but can never hope to convey <em>“the”</em> truth.</p>



<p>And that is exactly where the hack comes in.</p>



<p>Suppose you’re trying to convince people of “<em>something</em>”. Perhaps you want to convince people that Amazon is (or isn’t) a great place to work. Perhaps you want to convince people that illegal immigrants are (or aren’t) dangerous. Or perhaps you want to convince people that New York is (or isn’t) a safe place to live.</p>



<p>It certainly helps to have the facts and statistics on your side, but it isn’t necessary. All you have to do is hack the human brain by flooding it with cherry-picked stories. Stories that reinforce the message you’re trying to send.</p>



<p>For example, if you want to convince people that Amazon is an awful place to work, all you have to do is publicize as many stories as you can, about people who have had negative work experiences at Amazon. With almost a million employees, you’re guaranteed to find ~20 stories that are horrendously bad, even if Amazon is a stellar employer. Your opponents can lecture all they want about <em>“employee surveys”</em> and <em>“Glassdoor ratings”</em>, but ultimately, what’s really going to stick are the 20 horror stories of sexual harassment and workplace bullying, which you’ve described in graphic detail. A million happy employees is a statistic, but a single unfair dismissal is a tragedy.</p>



<p>Luckily for Amazon, the converse is also just as true. If Amazon wants to convince people that they are a great place to work, they too can ignore all quantitative data and dig up stories of their own. They can comb through their workforce and highlight the most heartwarming stories that are sure to make us smile. Someone with learning disabilities who was struggling to hold a full-time job, until they found their home at Amazon. A veteran trying to return to civilian life while coping with PTSD, finally finding sanctuary at the Amazon warehouse. A single mother struggling to pay the bills, finally getting back on her feet thanks to a job offer from Amazon. It doesn’t matter what the broader trends are, as long as you can find enough compelling outliers to showcase your cause.</p>



<p>The same dirty tactic works in almost every issue. Want to convince people that illegal immigrants are making America unsafe? Go on primetime television and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhwwbNA3hjg" target="_blank">publicize an illegal immigrant who killed someone while driving drunk</a>. Want to convince people that undocumented immigrants actually possess a wealth of potential? Publicize an undocumented immigrant <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WISmbOw_bMk" target="_blank">heroically saving a child</a>. Want to discredit any political movement? Simply find <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzDhm808oU4" target="_blank">the most ignorant or deplorable</a> members of that movement, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRZlHb2sXS8" target="_blank">flood YouTube with videos mocking them</a>.</p>



<p>Want to convince people that USA, and not USSR, deserves most of the credit for turning back the Nazi tide in Europe? Feed the public with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Day_(film)" target="_blank">steady stream</a> of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" target="_blank">blockbuster movies</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)" target="_blank">TV shows</a> that depict in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglourious_Basterds" target="_blank">vivid detail</a> American battles against the Nazis, while completely ignoring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">far larger battles on the Eastern front</a>.</p>



<p>Not that any of this needs to be a concerted conspiracy hatched by a secretive cabal of invisible puppet masters. Even if it occurs organically and unintentionally, it will still have the same effect.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter what the studies and statistics actually say – the person with the more compelling and better publicized story will win out. A fact that has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic#Applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">borne out repeatedly by studies</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Unusual and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases… when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate “newsworthy” events as more likely because they can more readily recall an example from memory.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><em>people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime and police immorality in the real world than those not exposed to vivid television. These results suggest that television violence does in fact have a direct causal impact on participants’ social reality beliefs. Repeated exposure to vivid violence leads to an increase in people’s risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><em>Participants in a 1992 study read case descriptions of hypothetical patients who … showed symptoms of two different diseases. Participants were instructed to indicate which disease they thought the patient had… Consistent with the availability heuristic, either the more common (influenza) or the more publicized (AIDS) disease was chosen.</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><em>research has pointed out that under the availability heuristic, humans are not reliable because they assess probabilities by giving more weight to current or easily recalled information instead of processing all relevant information. … They showed the availability heuristic to play a role in analysis of forecasts and influence investments because of this</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><em>the news media present a highly selective and non-representative selection of crime, focusing on the violent and extreme, rather than the ordinary. This makes most people think that judges are too lenient. But, when asked to choose the punishments, the sentences given by students were equal to or less severe than those given by judges. In other words, the availability heuristic made people believe that judges and jurors were too lenient in the courtroom, but the participants gave similar sentences when placed in the position of the judge</em></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p><em>Researchers predicted that mock jurors would rate a witness to be more deceptive if the witness testified truthfully before lying than when the witness was caught lying first before telling the truth. If the availability heuristic played a role in this, lying second would remain in jurors’ minds (since it …</em></p></blockquote></div></div>

<h2>Alan J. Perlis</h2>

The phenomena surrounding computers are diverse and yield a
surprisingly rich base for launching metaphors at individual and group
activities. Conversely, classical human endeavors provide an
inexhaustible source of metaphor for those of us who are in labor
within computation.  Such relationships between society and device are
not new, but the incredible growth of the computer's influence (both
real and implied) lends this symbiotic dependency a vitality like a
gangly youth growing out of his clothes within an endless puberty.

</p><p> The epigrams that follow attempt to capture some of the dimensions
of this traffic in imagery that sharpens, focuses, clarifies, enlarges
and beclouds our view of this most remarkable of all mans' artifacts,
the computer.
</p><ol>
<li> One man's constant is another man's variable.

</li><li> Functions delay binding: data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the 
programming process.

</li><li> Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semi-colons.

</li><li> Every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits.

</li><li> If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.

</li><li> Symmetry is a complexity reducing concept (co-routines include sub-routines); seek it everywhere.

</li><li> It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.

</li><li> A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.

</li><li> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data 
structures.

</li><li> Get into a rut early: Do the same processes the same way. Accumulate idioms. Standardize. The only difference (!) between Shakespeare and you was the size of his idiom list - not the size of his vocabulary.

</li><li> If  you have a procedure with 10 parameters, you probably missed some. 

</li><li> Recursion is the root of computation since it trades description for time.

</li><li> If two people write exactly the same program, each should be put in micro-code and then they 
certainly  won't be the same.

</li><li> In the long run every program becomes rococo - then rubble.

</li><li> Everything should be built top-down, except the first time.

</li><li> Every program has (at least) two purposes: the one for which it was written and another for which it wasn't.

</li><li> If a listener nods his head when you're explaining your program, wake him up.

</li><li> A program without a loop and a structured variable isn't worth writing.

</li><li> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.

</li><li> Wherever there is modularity there is the potential for misunderstanding: Hiding information 
implies a need to check communication.

</li><li> Optimization hinders evolution.

</li><li> A good system can't have a weak command language.

</li><li> To understand a program you must become both the machine and the program.

</li><li> Perhaps if  we wrote programs from childhood on, as adults we'd be able to read them.

</li><li> One can only display complex information in the mind. Like seeing, movement or flow 
or alteration of view is more important than the static picture, no matter how lovely.

</li><li> There will always be things we wish to say in our programs that in all known languages 
can only be said poorly.

</li><li> Once you understand how to write a program get someone else to write it.

</li><li> Around computers it is difficult to find the correct unit of time to measure progress. Some 
cathedrals took a century to complete. Can you imagine the grandeur and scope of a program that 
would take as long?

</li><li> For systems, the analogue of a face-lift is to add to the control graph an edge that creates a cycle, 
not just an additional node.

</li><li> In programming, everything we do is a special case of something more general - and often we know 
it too quickly.

</li><li> Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.

</li><li> Programmers are not to be measured by their ingenuity and their logic but by the completeness of 
their case analysis. 

</li><li> The 11th commandment was "Thou Shalt Compute" or "Thou Shalt Not Compute" - I forget which.

</li><li> The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. 
It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.

</li><li> Everyone can be taught to sculpt: Michelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is 
with the great programmers.

</li><li> The use of a program to prove the 4-color theorem will not change mathematics - it merely 
demonstrates that the theorem, a challenge for a century, is probably not important to mathematics.

</li><li> The most important computer is the one that rages in our skulls and ever seeks that satisfactory 
external emulator. The standardization of real computers would be a disaster - and so it probably won't happen. 

</li><li> Structured Programming supports the law of the excluded muddle.

</li><li> Re graphics: A picture is worth 10K words - but only those to describe the picture. Hardly any 
sets of 10K words can be adequately described with pictures.

</li><li> There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.

</li><li> Some programming languages manage to absorb change, but withstand progress.

</li><li> You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of  FORTRAN.

</li><li> In software systems it is often the early bird that makes the worm.

</li><li> Sometimes I think the only universal in the computing field is the fetch-execute-cycle.

</li><li> The goal of computation is the emulation of our synthetic abilities, not the understanding of our 
analytic ones.

</li><li> Like punning, programming is a play on words.

</li><li> As Will Rogers would have said, "There is no such thing as a free variable."

</li><li> The best book on programming for the layman is "Alice in Wonderland"; but that's because it's 
the best book on anything for the layman.

</li><li> Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use 
squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon 
bra and fig-leaf.

</li><li> When we understand knowledge-based systems, it will be as before - except our finger-tips will 
have been singed.

</li><li> Bringing computers into the home won't change either one, but may revitalize the corner saloon.

</li><li> Systems have sub-systems and sub-systems have sub-systems and so on ad infinitum - which is 
why we're always starting over.

</li><li> So many good ideas are never heard from again once they embark in a voyage on the semantic gulf.

</li><li> Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.

</li><li> A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

</li><li> Software is under a constant tension. Being symbolic it is arbitrarily perfectible; but also it is 
arbitrarily changeable.

</li><li> It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

</li><li> Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.

</li><li> In English every word can be verbed. Would that it were so in our programming languages.

</li><li> Dana Scott is the Church of the Lattice-Way Saints.

</li><li> In programming, as in everything else, to be in error is to be reborn.

</li><li> In computing, invariants are ephemeral.

</li><li> When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.

</li><li> Often it is means that justify ends: Goals advance technique and technique survives even when 
goal structures crumble.

</li><li> Make no mistake about it: Computers process numbers - not symbols. We measure our 
understanding (and control) by the extent to which we can arithmetize an activity.

</li><li> Making something variable is easy. Controlling duration of constancy is the trick.

</li><li> Think of all the psychic energy expended in seeking a fundamental distinction between "algorithm" 
and "program".

</li><li> If we believe in data structures, we must believe in independent (hence simultaneous) processing. 
For why else would we collect items within a structure? Why do we tolerate languages that give us the 
one without the other?

</li><li> In a 5 year period we get one superb programming language. Only we can't control when the 
5 year period will begin.

</li><li> Over the centuries the Indians developed sign language for communicating phenomena of interest. Programmers from different tribes (FORTRAN, LISP, ALGOL, SNOBOL, etc.) could use one that 
doesn't require them to carry a blackboard on their ponies.

</li><li> Documentation is like term insurance: It satisfies because almost no one who subscribes to it 
depends on its benefits.

</li><li> An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.

</li><li> It is not a language's weaknesses but its strengths that control the gradient of its change:
Alas, a language never escapes its embryonic sac.

</li><li> It is possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole 
point is to always see it as soap bubble?

</li><li> Because of its vitality, the computing field is always in desperate need of new cliches: Banality 
soothes our nerves.

</li><li> It is the user who should parameterize procedures, not their creators.

</li><li> The cybernetic exchange between man, computer and algorithm is like a game of musical chairs: 
The frantic search for balance always leaves one of the three standing ill at ease.

</li><li> If  your computer speaks English it was probably made in Japan.

</li><li> A year spent in artificial intelligence is enough to make one believe in God.

</li><li> Prolonged contact with the computer turns mathematicians into clerks and vice versa.

</li><li> In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word "frustration".

</li><li> We are on the verge: Today our program proved Fermat's next-to-last theorem!

</li><li> What is the difference between a Turing machine and the modern computer? It's the same as that
 between Hillary's ascent of Everest and the establishment of a Hilton hotel on its peak.

</li><li> Motto for a research laboratory: What we work on today, others will first think of tomorrow.

</li><li> Though the Chinese should adore APL, it's FORTRAN they put their money on.

Rust has gained a lot of adoption in the past few years and developers are loving it. Although there are numerous other systems programming languages, Rust is one of the very few alternatives to C/C++ that can hold its own when it comes to performance.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><figure id="attachment_622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622"><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg" alt="Rust programming language" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-1024x381.jpg 1024w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-300x112.jpg 300w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust-768x286.jpg 768w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rust.jpg 1337w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-622"><a href="https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/programmieren-in-rust/blob/master/slides/20-Rust-Community-Open-Source.pdf">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Rust is the language of our choice at Polymath for our upcoming Blockchain, Polymesh. In this post, I’ll be sharing some of my favorite Rust tricks and some tips for the new developers.</p><h3>Enum size is bounded by the largest&nbsp;member</h3><p>Enums are sized to be able to hold their largest variant. Therefore, it’s recommended to have similar sized variants within enums to avoid having a nonoptimal memory layout. You can consider boxing the larger variants if required. Consider this example:</p><pre>enum Foo{<br>    A(u64),<br>    B([u64; 1000]),<br>}<p>enum FooBoxing {<br>    A(u64),<br>    B(Box&lt;[u64;1000]&gt;)<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::A(0); // Its size is 8008 bytes.<br>    let y = FooBoxing::A(0); // Its size is just 16 bytes.<br>    println!("Foo size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;x));<br>    println!("FooBoxing size {:?}",  std::mem::size_of_val(&amp;y));<br>}</p></pre><p>In the above example, variant A of enum Foo is much smaller in size than variant B but the memory layout used for both variants will be the same and hence when variant A is used, it will have nonoptimal performance.</p><h3>Avoid unnecessary clones</h3><p>Calling&nbsp;<code>.clone()</code> on a variable creates a copy of their data and it takes resources to create a copy. Therefore, clones have a negative performance effect in most cases and should be avoided. Often times, you will be able to pass references of the same variables to different functions rather than needing to clone them. For example:</p><pre>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x.clone()); //This clone is not needed<br>}<p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    func(x.clone());<br>    func(x); // This will work fine because you do not need<br>             // to use x after this call<br>}</p><p>fn main() {<br>    let x = Foo::new();<br>    // If you are able to edit func, it's likely that <br>    // you will be able to modify it to use references. <br>    // You wont need to use any clones then.<br>    func(&amp;x);<br>    func(&amp;x); <br>}</p></pre><h3>Modularizing tests</h3><p>If you structure your tests like</p><pre>tests/   <br>    foo.rs   <br>    bar.rs </pre><p>Then each one of those tests gets compiled as a separate binary, and that takes more compilation time and space. You can instead add your test files as modules to a single test so that only a single binary is generated. Your new tests structure will look something like:</p><pre>tests/<br>   all/<br>     mod.rs // mod foo; mod bar;<br>     foo.rs<br>     bar.rs<br>   mod.rs // mod all;</pre><p>I was able to cut our CI test time in Polymesh from 26 minutes to 8 minutes using this trick. It has the disadvantage that you can not change one test file and compile just that file. It will always compile the full binary even if you have changed just one test file. For us, compiling individual files was only ~10 seconds faster than compiling the full binary and hence we decided to go with this approach.</p><h3>The dbg!&nbsp;macro</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.dbg.html">dbg macro</a> can be used to print the value as well as the source code of an express to stderr. Example usage:</p><pre>let a = 2;<br>let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;</pre><p>The above code will print:</p><pre>[src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4</pre><h3>Using _ to make large numbers&nbsp;legible</h3><p>In Rust, you can use <code>_</code> between numbers to make them easier to understand.</p><pre>let answer = 42000000; // ugly<br>let answer = 42_000_000; // beautiful</pre><h3>The standard swap&nbsp;function</h3><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.swap.html">swap function</a> allows you to directly swap two variables without needing to create a temporary variable.</p><pre>use std::mem;<p>let mut x = 5;<br>let mut y = 42;</p><p>mem::swap(&amp;mut x, &amp;mut y);</p><p>assert_eq!(42, x);<br>assert_eq!(5, y);</p></pre><h3>? converts between error&nbsp;types</h3><p>As you probably already know,&nbsp;<code>?</code> can be imagined as <code>unwrap</code> that returns the error instead of panicking. Instead of directly returning the error,&nbsp;<code>?</code> actually returns <code>Err(From::from(err))</code>. That means the error is automatically converted to the proper type if it is convertible.</p><h3>Same name macro, function, and&nbsp;type</h3><p>It is possible to declare a macro, a function and a type like an Enum with the same name and then import all three of them elsewhere with a single import statement.</p><h3>sccache</h3><p>sccache can cache cargo build artifacts so that they can be reused across workspaces. This means that if you have multiple Rust projects and they use an identical dependency, sccache will allow you to compile that dependency once and then reuse across the projects. It will save you compilation time and disk space. Rust target dirs are already so big, there’s no reason to store redundant binaries there.</p><p><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png" alt="rust target directory is very heavy" width="720" height="538" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy.png 720w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rust_heavy-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></p><p>You can install <code>sccache</code> with Cargo: <code>cargo install sccache</code>. To enable <code>sccache</code>, you need to add <code>RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your build environment. One way to do that is to add <code>export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache</code> to your&nbsp;<code>.bashrc</code>.</p><h3>Clippy and&nbsp;rustfmt</h3><p>They are two of my favorite Rust tools and if you don’t already use them, give them a try. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> can catch a variety of lints in your code and helps you write idiomatic code. To install Clippy, run <code>rustup component add clippy</code> and to run Clippy in your workspace, execute <code>cargo clippy</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>rustfmt, as the name suggests, is a tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines. To install rustfmt, run <code>rustup component add rustfmt</code> and to run rustfmt in your workspace, execute <code>cargo fmt</code>. More information can be found on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt’s GitHub</a>.</p><p>I’d also like to give a shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>. It is an experimental modular compiler frontend for the Rust language. It works better than any other Rust compiler frontend for me. I highly recommend everyone to try it out.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Rust has a lot to offer and you can learn something new about Rust every day. I hope you learned something new from this post. If you want to add something or need help, feel free to leave a comment or reach out to me via other mediums.</p><h3>Happy Hacking!</h3></div></div></article></div>]]>

	<article>

		


		<p>You have read my article on <a href="https://blog.luap.info/why-most-saas-companies-cant-be-successful-with-both-enterprise-and-smb-customers.html">the differences between Saas enterprise and Saas SMB</a> you are currently selling to SMB and are wondering how you can get your first Enterprise customer, I will try to help you do so.</p>
<p>If you have read my article carefully you know that what you are trying to do is hard in the long run, sustain both kind of customers (SMB and Enterprise) in the long term requires a lot of agility and excellence in all departments of your company</p>
<h2>Understand that selling to this new type of customer is completely different</h2>
<p>You are used to communicate with your customers through SEO and digital marketing, none of that works with Enterprise customer, they care about being able to talk with someone. Someone who understands their problem, someone who listen to them more than solve their issue. In bigger company, the decision maker is not the one who is going to use your product, he doesn't need to know how the product work, the product features, the number of steps it takes to change an image,...</p>
<p>They need to know, the ROI of your product and if they are aligned with your vision (sometime you also have some legal requirements or certification issue). None of the those 2 elements need to be true. The ROI can be wrong but the customer need to beleive it is true, the vision can hide a malfunctionning product. This is the sad trough of enterprise sales, your job is to present the topic in such way that the customer is wanting to hear about it. After they buy your product they will most of time stick with it for several years and will almost never ask you back about the features they talked to you about during the sales process. They are used to care more about the platform being able to scale with their volume, and their useless pixel perfect design, and other things which are not helpfull to achieve their objective. </p>
<p>Big comapnies can't take risk, a legal risk can be the end of their business, a scallability issue could be a nightmare for their communication. Big companies move slowly, just the fact of changing of provider is a huge risk for them.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example, imagine you are Facebook and you notice that your product (facebook.com) is less and less used by people and you understand that this is such way because people think the design is too old school, and young people don't indentify with it anymore because they prefer dynamic product like TikTok, what will you do  ? Will you try modify your design to be more dynamic ? Probably not, changing is probably more risky than keeping thing as it is, you have quarter forecast to make and doing such change will probably put you in the dark regarding your future. So you have two options to continue react:</p>
<ul>
<li>You change things slowly, you start with updating the design of messenger, it takes you 6 months, then you start changing the group product, and so on, the changes will take you years to achieve, and probably after a few years (before you complete the product revamp) the design will again not be matching user expectation</li>
<li>You buy Tiktok or Instagram or Snapchat or ... and let them the autonomy to keep growing without interference</li>
</ul>
<p>A small companies on the contrary has 3 customers, it doesnt really care if it has to lost them to migrate to a better product, this company is therefore more agile because it has also nothing to loose.</p>
<p>Remove from your brain how you are used to sell to small businesses, enterprise requires a complete different approach. </p>
<h2>Adapt your pitch</h2>
<p>If there is only one thing that you need to adapt it is what you are pitching to your prospect, you are probably used to talk about individual features, this is wrong to do in enterprise, this is the last thing you want to do. What you want to talk about it the vision, what is the vision of your products, what is the vision of your company, what is the vision of your customers. Enterprise customers are looking for long term reliable partner, they want to feel that you understand their problem and that you are long term engaged to help them.</p>
<p>So first, talk about your vision, if the prospect is talking to you about a feature, answer quickly and redirect the discussion that saying that this is not the most important.</p>
<p>Usually the sales cycle in enterprise is splitted in 3 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>First phase, qualification of the prospect : does the prospect have the same vision as your company ? (usually a phone call)</li>
<li>Second phase, understand the prospect issues: You need to talk to them to understand what are their issues, what they want to do, how they want to do, when they want to do it, .... The prospect needs to feel listened, they need to feel ok sharing with you their issues and wanting to collaborate with you, they should share with your their vision, understand your positioning and seeing that you are here to help them and you have time for them (a physical meeting, with usually a generic presentation from you, but this is just a support the meeting should be interactive)</li>
<li>Third phase, the proposition : you explained to them what you have to offer them, that's also the good time (if necessary, a lot of enterprise softwares are sold without the prospect even seeing the product) to make a demo of few features that they would be able to use, the ROI of the product, the structure of your organization, the strutures of your futures exchanges ( for new features contact this email, for technical issue contact this other email, lets have a regular call every quarter,..., dont hesitate to promote, for example, a simple software engineer to Head of Tech virtually to just make your organization look more mature) and then the price of your solution</li>
</ul>
<p>At no point of the process you should tell about your flaws, you can talk about your limits, but never acknowledge a flaw, because usually a flaw is not a really a flaw, it is more a limitation. You should be confident about what you are selling, the prospect is taking some time with you, so they are thinking you are a credible solution and you should act as one. Never forget that other competitors may have 10 times more customers and employees than you, the reality is that they are not agile anymore and their software is lagging probably a f ew years behind yours. Position yourselft as a leader of your sector and dont be demanding. if the prospect is asking something very different than what you are offering, it means that you did a bad job at phase 1 ans phase 2. You can adpat your vision, but don't change everything, keep your culture and authenticity</p>
<p>To sum up :</p>
<ul>
<li>Be confident you are a credible solution</li>
<li>Don't talk about your product, instead talk about your vision</li>
<li>Listen to the prospect and create a trustfull discussion</li>
<li>Don't accept everything, stay as you are. The product is not going to change they need to adapt to you</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accept the consequences</h2>
<p>Going after enterprise customers is going to change many things in your organization, you will probably have more contact with them than you used to have with your old customers. They will not call you when they have an issue, you will have to call them to ask them if everything is going well instead. You will have to get used to talk about your vision with them, and expect them to answer slower to your requests.</p>
<p>You will have to keep building on a strong personal relationship with them instead of just one centred on the product. This is not going to be easy, even for your small organization being able to make all those changes is going to take time, and sales processes with enterprise customers are always longer, it is not weird to have a sales process taking more than a year </p>
<p>This article also applies to less Saas business, and any business in general even though you will need to adapt things to your industry. But the principles are going to be the same</p>

    <p>10 Jul 2020</p>
<h2><code>sudo</code> with TouchID and Apple Watch, even inside <code>tmux</code></h2>
<p>Ever since TouchID was introduced in the 2016 MacBook Pro, I wondered why it could replace user authentication dialogs in the GUI, like System Preferences or Installer, but not in the command line, for things like <code>sudo</code>. Perhaps predictably, many nerds on the internet had the same idea, and for a while you could <a href="https://github.com/mattrajca/sudo-touchid">install a fork of sudo</a> (!!) or a <a href="https://github.com/hamzasood/pam_touchid">custom PAM module</a> to get TouchID support.</p>

<p>It turns out that none of that was actually needed, though, and a (somewhat obsure) built-in way to enable it was <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/status/931292107372838912">shared on Twitter in 2017</a>. Surprisingly, Apple actually ships a PAM module named <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/pam_modules/pam_modules-173.1.1/modules/pam_tid/pam_tid.c.auto.html"><code>pam_tid.so</code></a> in every copy of macOS. If you <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/306324">configure <code>sudo</code> to use it</a>, you can skip typing your password and just TouchID instead, without having to completely destroy the security of your machine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it never worked for me. 😭 Some debugging later, I figured out that it worked inside a regular shell, but not inside shells opened by <code>tmux</code> or <code>ssh</code>. Since I pretty much exclusively use shells opened by <code>tmux</code> and <code>ssh</code>, I spent some time frantically googling around for how to fix them, and found pretty much nothing. It worked outside of tmux, it didn’t work inside tmux, and that was that.</p>

<p>Fast forward three years to today, and while griping to a friend about how it didn’t work inside tmux, I discovered that technology has advanced and there is now <a href="https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach">a fix, named <code>pam_reattach</code></a>! It’s a PAM module that you configure to run before the built-in <code>pam_tid.so</code>, and it makes the <code>sudo</code> command able to find and use the TouchID module to authenticate, even from inside <code>tmux</code>.</p>

<p>Amazingly, I was even able to find a written explanation of the thought process that produced the PAM module, in the form of this <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1348180">Stack Overflow answer</a>. Based on that answer and the linked discussion, it seems the steps were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apple patches <code>screen</code> to stay attached to a user’s GUI login session, so that CLI tools like <code>pbcopy</code>, <code>security</code>, and system calls like TouchID checks will continue to work.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen">@ChrisJohnsen</a> uses some of the undocumented functions called by the <code>screen</code> patch to implement the now-ubiquitous <a href="https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/"><code>reattach-to-user-namespace</code></a> command that allows <code>pbcopy</code> and <code>pbpaste</code> to continue working inside <code>tmux</code> or non-Apple <code>screen</code>.</li>
  <li>Once TouchID MacBooks have emerged, <a href="https://twitter.com/cabel/">@Cabel</a> reveals the existence of <code>pam_tid.so</code> and TouchID authentication for <code>sudo</code>. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work in non-GUI processes like SSH, tmux, or homebrewed screen.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fabianishere">@fabianishere</a>, again inspired by Apple’s patches to <code>screen</code>, sends pull requests that re-enable TouchID to both <a href="https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard/pull/70">reattach-to-user-namespace</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/pull/1434">tmux</a>.</li>
  <li>After some discussion of unfortunate tradeoffs, both PRs are closed, and they create a new PAM module, analogous to <code>reattach-to-user-namespace</code> but just for the PAM flow: <a href="https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach"><code>pam_reattach</code></a>. This enables TouchID for <code>sudo</code> in both <code>tmux</code> and homebrewed <code>screen</code>.</li>
  <li>In macOS Catalina, Apple adds Apple Watch confirmations to the “TouchID” system. If you have an Apple Watch configured to unlock your Mac, you can also double-tap the watch button to confirm a TouchID prompt instead of scanning your finger.</li>
  <li>Enterprising Swift coder <a href="https://github.com/Reflejo">@Reflejo</a> wrote a new PAM module to enable TouchID support named <a href="https://github.com/Reflejo/pam-touchID"><code>pam-touchid</code></a>. Implemented in Swift, it is 1/3 shorter and (in my opinion) about 1000x easier to understand than the <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/pam_modules/pam_modules-173.1.1/modules/pam_tid/pam_tid.c.auto.html">straight C module from Apple</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/biscuitehh/">@biscuitehh</a>, not content with Apple Watch <code>sudo</code> exclusively on Macs with TouchID hardware, forked <code>pam-touchid</code> into <a href="https://github.com/biscuitehh/pam-watchid"><code>pam-watchid</code></a>, a PAM module that allows <code>sudo</code> via Apple Watch on any Mac.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m pretty excited that I can finally <code>sudo</code> using my fingerprint or my watch, and a little bit in awe of the way determined nerds manage to figure things out eventually. Nice work, everyone.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>In <a href="https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/will-csharp-replace-fsharp/">my previous post</a> in this series I discussed at a high level why C# will not render F# obsolete even as it gains more features. I also briefly discussed how a more limited and more focused feature-set can often be beneficial, although I didn't give any real examples of where this applies. So, I thought it would be useful to highlight features that C# has that F# <em>doesn't</em> have, and explain what the "cost" of them are - as well as what benefits you gain by <em>not</em> having them.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll highlight five features relating to some core fundamentals of C# and F# - mutability, statements and expressions; in the next post in this series I'll cover five other miscellaneous (but equally important!) C# features that are quite different in F#.</p>
<p>It's my hope that by looking at these, it helps you to realise that a strength of a language can't simply be measured by the number of features and there's always a trade-off to be had. Most of these design decisions are deeply baked into both C# and F# and it would be quite difficult to change or replace most of them today.</p>
<h2>1. Mutation</h2>
<p>By default, every value in F# is immutable. After you create a value - be that a simple primitive such an an <code>int</code> or a <code>Customer</code> record, you can't change them. For a record, this applies to all the fields, all the way down the chain. For developers used to working with imperative, mutable structures, it seems impossible to be usable but trust me - you definitely <em>can</em> write entire applications without <em>any</em> mutable values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You <em>can</em> create mutable <em>variables</em> in F#, but it requires adding an extra <code>mutable</code> keyword whenever you define them.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>type Person = { Name : string; Age : int }
let p = { Name = "Sara"; Age = 28 }
p.Name &lt;- "Sarah" // error: This field is not mutable</code></pre>
<p>What are the benefits of this? The usual one that people talk about is parallelisation, which is true (you can safely share immutable data across threads, since no-one can modify the value), but there are others.</p>
<p>Firstly, trust: you can give any part of your code an immutable value and not have to worry about someone else modifying it. Once set, a value can <em>never</em> change!</p>
<p>And secondly, this decision has the unusual effect of changing how F# deals with accessibility: In F#, all functions, types and fields are <em>public</em> by default! Contrast this with C#, where you need to mark all public properties explicitly. Again, at first glance this seems unusual, but think about it: If you can't modify a value, where's the harm in anyone reading it? You may worry about encapsulation, but that's also something that tends not to be a concern in F#.</p>
<h2>2. Void</h2>
<p>F# doesn't have <code>void</code>. Instead, it has a value called <code>Unit</code> which contains no data but can be assigned, passed as an argument into a function and generally reasoned about. This fits into the F# mentality that <em>everything</em> is an expression and that <em>everything</em> has a result; you can't have a function that doesn't have an output.</p>
<p>Again, removing something gives you a benefit in its place: the unification of the type system. For example, there's no need any longer for both <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can simply use <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, since what you might consider a "void-returning" <code>Task</code> can now be treated as a <code>Task&lt;unit&gt;</code> - a <code>Task</code> that returns a value which <em>happens to contain no data</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, you can think about functions in F# even further than this: <em>every</em> function in F# has <em>one</em> input and <em>one</em> output! Multiple input arguments are either tupled (which is a single value) or are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/functions/#calling-a-function">partially applied</a>. Think about that for a minute 🙂</p>
<h2>3. Early Return</h2>
<p>You can't return early from a function in F#. This is because everything in F# is an expression, so a function body can't simply arbitrarily return out of itself early. Take the following pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        return "You are over 100!" // early return

    if inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        return "Good"
    else
        return "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>In proper F#, you would write this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>let complexProcessing inputArg =
    if ServiceLayer.isInvalid input then
        "You are over 100!"
    elif inputArg.Name = "Fred" then
        "Good"
    else
        "Bad"</code></pre>
<p>Two things stand out here: First, because there's no "early return", everything is unified to the same "level". Indeed, you would probably rewrite this using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/pattern-matching">pattern matching</a> which makes this even clearer. The second difference is that there is <em>no need</em> for the <code>return</code> keyword. Since everything in F# is an expression, and there's no early return, the final expression in any code block is by definition the result of that block. Simples!</p>
<h2>4. Implicit expressions</h2>
<p>Because F# is expression-oriented, and every function has a result, it makes no sense in calling a function (or any expression) and <em>not</em> assigning its result to a symbol. C# permits this, but F# will not allow you to simply discard the result of an expression:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
add 1 2 // warning: the result of this expression has type `int` and is implicitly ignored.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one exception to this rule: if an expression returns <code>unit</code>, F# realises that it is performing a side-effect of some kind e.g. writing to the console. In this case, the compiler will allow you to silently "ignore" the <code>unit</code> value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>one</em> situation where the C# compiler also will not silently throw away the result of a method call: if you're in an async / await block and forget to await an awaitable method call (i.e. something that returns a <code>Task</code>). But everywhere else, the compiler won't warn you. And thinking about it, that's not surprising because C# doesn't really have the same clear distinction between statements and expressions as F# has (indeed, I believe that there is even such a thing as a <em>statement expression</em> in C#!), and C# expressions are often limited to single lines of code.</p>
<p>But in F#, the way you write code is more about passing immutable values to functions that return <em>new values</em> - so the compiler takes a more active role in assisting you as you work to ensure you don't forget to deal with a value. If you really want to ignore the result of a function, F# has a built-in function called <code>ignore</code>, which simply takes in any value and returns <code>unit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let add a b = a + b + 10
ignore(add 1 2) // no warning</code></pre>
<h2>5. Implicit Conversions</h2>
<p>Except in <em>extremely rare cases</em>, F# doesn't allow implicit conversions of one type to another. Even an <code>int</code> to a <code>float</code>, or an <code>int</code> to a <code>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</code> is forbidden. Instead, you have to <em>explicitly</em> convert between them. This can initially feel clunky and event a little unsettling, but as it turns out, since F# has a lightweight syntax by nature, the extra "cost" of typing wrappers (such as <code>Nullable&lt;'T&gt;</code>) or conversions (<code>int</code> or <code>float</code>) is not nearly as painful as you might think.</p>
<p>In addition, doing so brings two benefits: firstly, there's an increase in predictability and simplicity - no magic conversions means less for you to think about in terms of what the compiler is doing. And secondly it makes type inference far more usable, because the compiler does not have to worry about the possibility of implicit conversions.</p>
<p>As a result F# can infer most anything for you - return types of functions, value types and function inputs. In the example below, the compiler can <em>guarantee</em> that <code>first</code> and <code>second</code> are integers, because we're adding <code>123</code> to them.</p>
<pre><code>let add first second = first + second + 123

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = 10 // Error: This expression was expected to have type Nullable&lt;int&gt; but here has type int

let x:Nullable&lt;int&gt; = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Works.
let x = Nullable&lt;int&gt;(10) // Still works - basic type inference
let x = Nullable 10 // Still works - better type inference, no new keyword or parentheses</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Observe that there is no need to specify <code>&lt;int&gt;</code> for the final line of code - the compiler infers it for us. We also don't need the <code>new</code> keyword (this is largely optional in F#), or parentheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I hope you "got" the point of this post - reinforcing the idea that every language feature has a cost and that <em>not</em> having a specific feature in a language can open up doors to entirely different features that may outweigh the original feature that we've "lost".</p>

<p><em>Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests.  </em></p>

<p><em>“Nobody predicted the coral bleaching scenario. If a similar thing evolves with forests, that is pretty catastrophic,” he said. “We’re at a point where we can see the process, we can predict it. It’s time to start making some noise about it. We can’t afford to sit on our hands.” </em></p>



<p><em>An&nbsp;<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15042020/megadrought-american-west-south-america-drought-climate-change">emerging megadrought</a>&nbsp;has already weakened and killed hundreds of millions of trees, including Rocky Mountain lodgepole and piñon pines, as well as aspens. </em></p>



<p>On an article from April 17 in the journal&nbsp;<em>Science</em>.  Following article from <em>Inside Climate News</em>, by Bob Berwyn, April 25, 2020<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24042020/forest-trees-climate-change-deforestation"> ‘We Need to Hear These Poor Trees Scream’: Unchecked Global Warming Means Big Trouble for Forests</a></p>

<p>Tim Brodribb has been measuring <strong>all the different ways global warming kills trees for the past 20 years. With a microphone, he says, you can hear them take their last labored breaths. During blistering heat waves and droughts, air bubbles invade their delicate, watery veins, cracking them open with an audible pop. And special cameras can film the moment their drying leaves split open in a lightning bolt pattern, disrupting photosynthesis.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We really need to be able to hear these poor trees scream. These are living things that are suffering. We need to listen to them,” said Brodribb, a plant physiologist at the University of Tasmania who led a recent study that helps identify exactly when, where and how trees succumb to heat and dryness.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The study, published April 17 in the journal&nbsp;<em>Science</em>, <strong>reviewed the last 10 years of research on tree mortality, concluding that forests are in big trouble if global warming&nbsp; continues at the present pace. Most trees alive today won’t be able to survive in the climate expected in 40 years, Brodribb said</strong>. The negative impacts of warming and drying are already outpacing the fertilization benefits of increased carbon dioxide.</p>



<p><strong>Trees and forests can be compared with corals and reefs, he said. Both are slow-growing and long-lived systems that can’t easily move or adapt in a short time to rapid warming</strong> and <strong>both have relatively inflexible damage thresholds. For corals, a global tipping point was reached from 2014 to 2016. </strong>In record-warm oceans, reefs around the world bleached and died.</p>



<p><strong>The detailed new information and modeling on how water stress kills trees suggests there is a similar drought threshold for tree mortality, beyond which forests could also perish on a global scale, he said.</strong></p>



<p>“Nobody predicted the coral bleaching scenario. If a similar thing evolves with forests, that is pretty catastrophic,” he said. <strong>“We’re at a point where we can see the process, we can predict it. It’s time to start making some noise about it. We can’t afford to sit on our hands.”</strong></p>



<h3>No CO2 Greening</h3>



<p>The new paper shows that the hope that rising carbon dioxide would green the planet is probably misplaced. Studies have shown that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere boosts photosynthesis, spurring plant growth by chemically combining the carbon with water and ground nutrients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there will “probably be more browning than greening,” said University of Arizona forest scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveBreshears">Dave Breshears</a>, who was not involved in the new research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<strong>The review ends on a hard note, with high confidence that we’re going to have a lot of impacts with hotter droughts in the future,” he said. Mass forest die-offs will proliferate and expand. The trend toward more extreme heat waves and droughts is lethal for forests</strong>. But despite the grim outlook, it’s important not to paint an entirely desperate picture, he said.</p>



<p>“<strong>It’s our choice of how much worse we want it to get. Every little bit of reduction of warming can have a positive effect. We can reduce the tree die-off. Are we going to make the choices to try and minimize that?</strong>“</p>



<p>Breshears has used tree mortality data to try and make near real-time projections for tree die-offs in the Southwest. This would help adapt forest management, including firefighting, to rapidly changing conditions in a region where <strong>an&nbsp;<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15042020/megadrought-american-west-south-america-drought-climate-change">emerging megadrought</a>&nbsp;has already weakened and killed hundreds of millions of trees, including Rocky Mountain lodgepole and piñon pines, as well as aspens.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Elsewhere, African cedars and acacias are dying, South America’s Amazon rainforest is struggling, and junipers are declining in the Middle East. In Spain and Greece, global warming is shriveling oaks, and even in moist, temperate northern Europe, unusual droughts have stressed vast stands of beech forests.</strong></p>



<p><strong>At the current pace of warming, much of the world will be inhospitable to forests as we know them within decades. The extinction of some tree species by direct or indirect action of drought and high temperatures is certain. And some recent research suggests that, in 40 years, none of the trees alive today will be able to survive the projected climate, Brodribb said.</strong></p>



<p>“That’s one of the potential scenarios, and we need to know if that’s right. We have to establish the consequences of rising temperatures unequivocally for policy makers,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stakes are high, since trees are the foundation for terrestrial biodiversity and because they capture and store about one-third of human-caused CO2 emissions within their dense wood frames. A global loss of forests could lead to a surge in heat-trapping carbon dioxide, causing more warming, and would also eliminate habitat for countless other animals, plants and fungi, with a rippling effect that reaches humans.</p>



<p>“The closer people are to the land and living at subsistence level, it’s going to hit those people hardest,” Breshears said.</p>



<h3>Shifting Forests</h3>



<p>Forests in warm and semi-arid regions may suffer the most in the decades ahead, but there may also be big changes in store for cooler, wetter regions. Some forests that need a lot of moisture could dry up with just a small decline in precipitation because rapid warming magnifies the loss of moisture from soils.</p>



<p>Even if forests don’t die, they will fundamentally change. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.15118">study</a>&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Global Change Biology</em>&nbsp;zoomed in on the evergreen forests in the Stubai Valley in Tirol, Austria. At 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) of global warming, which will be reached during the last few decades of this century, the dense stands of spruce and fir will change to a mix of oaks and pines, more like forests on the drier southern fringes of the Alps in Italy, the projections showed.</p>



<p>“We found that at warming levels above 2 degrees Celsius a threshold was crossed, with the system tipping into an alternative state,” the researchers wrote. Even warming that corresponds with the current policy goals of the Paris climate agreement could “result in critical transitions of forest ecosystems. Overshooting the climate targets could be dangerous, because “ecological impacts can be irreversible at millennial time scales once a tipping point has been crossed.”</p>



<h3>Forests on a Knife Edge</h3>



<p>The new paper reinforces the observational evidence that global warming has pushed many of the world’s forests to a knife edge, said University of Utah forest researcher Bill Anderegg. In the West, you can’t drive on a mountain highway without seeing how global warming affects forests, from wildfires to die-offs caused by beetles or other pathogens, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some areas, researchers have documented how forests are struggling to grow back. For example, in parts of the Four Corners region, hardly any new piñon pines have sprouted to replace trees killed by beetles in the early 2000s because it’s too warm for seeds to take hold and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And older trees conserve their energy to survive drought and fend off beetles rather than producing seeds. As result, there were almost&nbsp;<a href="https://navajotimes.com/reznews/no-pinons-beetles-drought-dying-trees-cause-no-crop-this-fall/">no piñon pine nuts to be harvested</a>&nbsp;last fall on the Navajo Nation, where the nutritious nuts have been part of cultural tradition for centuries.</p>



<p>“The risks of climate change to forests are substantial and going up faster than we thought,” Anderegg said. The new physiological models of trees and ecosystems helps pinpoint exactly when and where forests are vulnerable, with the aim of making credible forecasts for forests in this century, giving landowners and policymakers more useful tools, he added.</p>



<p>Accurate new information is also valuable for climate policy, because many national&nbsp; carbon-reduction targets based on the Paris climate agreement include tree planting as a key tool to reduce emissions. But rapid forest change and catastrophic die-offs could put a monkey wrench in those plans. And in addition to the direct tree-killing effects of heat and drought, interactions with other disturbances like insects and other pathogens will magnify forest die-offs, he said.</p>



<p>Restoration and Resilience?</p>



<p>University of Montana forest ecologist&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DianaSix1">Diana Six</a>&nbsp;said the conclusions in the new research weren’t surprising because she’s always been skeptical of the projected beneficial effects of carbon dioxide triggering photosynthesis in plants.</p>

<p>Does 2020 begin a new decade? To answer this question we must consult the Pope, the Kaiser, the census, a hockey player, and ISO 8601.</p>

<p>A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has <em>a new decade</em> also arrived?</p>
<p>The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=news">digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike</a>. We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">The New York Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/go-ahead-celebrate-the-new-decade-a-year-early-just-count-me-out-1.4127481">The Irish Times</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/when-does-the-new-decade-start-are-you-team-january-1-2020-or-team-january-1-2021-1624530-2019-12-02">India Today</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900">Farmer’s Almanac</a>, <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html">Timeanddate.com</a>, please somebody tell us!</em></p>
<p>Others resort to the nihilistic view that decades never begin or end, or rather, begin and end always and forever — they’re just ten-year spans of time without any defined order between them.<sup id="fnref:justspans"><a href="#fn:justspans">1</a></sup> This perspective was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/leafs-rielly-on-the-arrival-of-2020-i-dont-think-its-even-the-end-of-a-decade-174009256.html">introduced into the public mind</a> recently by Morgan Rielly, a player for the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s even the end of a decade. Every new year is the end of a decade.
2008 to 2018 [sic] is a decade. 2009 to 2019 [sic] is a decade. Every f—ing one is the end of
a decade. So all these people saying the decade’s come to an end — that happens
every new year.</p>
<p>So, it’s the end of the century, it’s the end of you-name-it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I’ll call the <em>Cardinals</em> and the <em>Ordinals</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Cardinals answer <em>yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations</em>. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer <em>no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning</em>. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress">the dress</a>” of 2015 — is that still this decade? — have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? If only some authoritative source could lend its weight to either camp.</p>

<p>In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn’t called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian</a>” for nothing; <a href="https://typesandtimes.net/2020/01/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)">Pope Gregory XIII</a> commissioned it in the 16th century. Recent articles on the subject have consulted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f">meteorological associations</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/">philosophy professors</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html">the United States Naval Observatory</a>.</p>
<p>I will put forward two potential authoritative sources on whether decades should be counted according to Cardinals or to Ordinals: ISO 8601 and decennial census legislation. And unfortunately, they lead us into different camps.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is the specification of (representations of) dates, times, and other calendar entities for use in computing. The International Organization for Standardization defines new versions every so often, the most recent one in 2019. It’s the closest thing we’ve got to a gold standard for dates and times in software. <em>What’s the right way to represent dates? Local times of day? Local times of day for some time zone? Time scales? Leap seconds?</em></p>
<p>ISO 8601 even defines a new standard calendar adapted from the Gregorian calendar.<sup id="fnref:iso8601calendar"><a href="#fn:iso8601calendar">2</a></sup> Just as Common Era was a secular substitution for Anno Domini, the ISO 8601 calendar supplants the Gregorian calendar. No more pesky Year 1 C.E. preceded by Year 1 B.C.E.; ISO 8601 has <em>Year Zero</em>,<sup id="fnref:yearzero"><a href="#fn:yearzero">3</a></sup> and negative years. That essentially makes the Ordinal thinking moot, as the first ISO 8601 decade includes the years 0 through 9, not 1 through 10.</p>
<p>Indeed, decades, as defined in ISO 8601, are the years <code>XXX0</code> through <code>XXX9</code>.<sup id="fnref:iso8601decade"><a href="#fn:iso8601decade">4</a></sup> For example, using <code>J</code> to denote decades, “the 2020s” are represented as <code>202J</code>; the “zero decade” is represented as <code>0J</code>; and “the negative zero decade,” meaning years -9 through 0, is represented as <code>-0J</code>. Somewhat strangely, the latter two decades both include year 0. As a consequence, ISO 8601 <em>really</em> rejects the Ordinals since decades no longer describe an ordered, mutually exclusive sequence of spans of ten years.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 is firmly in the camp of the Cardinals.</p>

<p>Not everyone finds ISO 8601 to be all that authoritative. But what about nation states? Although they don’t generally have reason to weigh in on the exact definitions of time, they do tend to institutionalize the decade in particular — as the period in which the government conducts a census. For those governments that conduct them decennially, surely they must spell out the precise formal interpretation of decades, right?</p>
<p>Recent legislation in the European Union does exactly that. In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/9670557/KS-GQ-18-010-EN-N.pdf/c3df7fcb-f134-4398-94c8-4be0b7ec0494">standardization of population and housing census methodology</a> for member states, the EU specifies that member nations run a census “every decade” on a “reference date” of their choosing. “The first reference year shall be 2011. […] Reference years shall fall during the beginning of every decade.”<sup id="fnref:eucensus"><a href="#fn:eucensus">5</a></sup> In other words, the <code>1</code> years begin the decades and therefore the EU implicitly takes up the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>For the United States in particular, it’s even <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf">in our Constitution</a> to apportion Congressional representatives according to state populations counted “every subsequent Term of ten Years,” though the period of “decade” is not used. In <a href="https://www.dos.ny.gov/info/constitution.htm">the New York state constitution</a>, however, not only is “decade” mentioned (also for apportionment of representatives), but its exact year bounds are explicitly clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… if, in any decade, counting from and including that which begins with the year
nineteen hundred thirty-one, such a readjustment or alteration is not made at the time
above prescribed, it shall be made at a subsequent session occurring not later than the
sixth year of such decade, meaning not later than nineteen hundred thirty-six,
nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred fifty-six, and so on …<sup id="fnref:ny"><a href="#fn:ny">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the mention of 1931 as the beginning of a decade and the mention of 1936 as the sixth year of the decade, the New York constitution clearly takes the Ordinal position.</p>
<p>Back to the whole US, the legal language around the decennial census itself does not seem to mention “decade” anywhere, not in any <a href="https://www.census.gov/history/www/reference/legislation/">historic iteration of the Census Act</a> and, surprisingly, not in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13">US Code Title 13</a> that codifies the census bureaucracy. Our census occurs in the <code>0</code> years but there’s no qualification that these <em>begin</em> each decade. A 1908 American Statistical Association <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2275965">survey of census methodology across the Americas</a>, however, sheds some light on the counting in this field:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most generally accepted dates for a decennial census are those that begin or end decades. The tenth year of the decade has been accepted in the United States and in several European countries, and in Brazil. England and most of her colonies accept the first year of the decade.<sup id="fnref:censusarticle"><a href="#fn:censusarticle">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US census occurs in the <code>0</code> years, referred to as the tenth (last) years of the decades, while the UK census occurs in the <code>1</code> years, referred to as the first years.</p>
<p>Altogether it seems that governments, at least those conducting decennial censuses in the anglophone world, take up the Ordinal position on decades.</p>

<p>With the geek and wonk authorities taking contradictory positions on the decade question, what about popular usage in the archives of major newspapers and other such publications? A scattershot of archival records, generally by searching for <code>"new decade"</code>, suggests that both counting styles have been used over the past century or so—and sometimes inconsistently in the same place.

<p>How big is the universe? While it is generally known that the universe is <em>very big</em>, the latest science reveals that its true size defies all comprehension.</p>
<p>By the end of this article, you will understand why the universe is so big, it guarantees the existence of aliens, mirror Earths, and even copies of you living in the distant past and far future.</p>
<h2>Historic Views</h2>
<p>Not long ago, people had a limited conception of reality. Five-hundred years ago most believed that Earth was the only world. But with new discoveries our picture of reality grew.</p>
<p>In time we came to understand other planets are whole worlds like Earth. A bit later, we learned stars are distant suns. Only in the last one hundred years has our conception of reality grown to include many galaxies, many <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_volume">Hubble volumes</a></em>, many <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bangs</a></em>, and most-recently the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">many universes</a>.</p>
<h3>Earth is the only World (Ancient Times)</h3>
<p>The Greeks spoke of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres">celestial sphere</a>, the old testament of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmament">firmament</a> in the sky — rigid canopies, either a sphere or dome, that surround the Earth and to which the stars are affixed.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Flammarion.jpg?resize=758%2C631&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Flammarion.jpg?resize=758%2C631&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Flammarion engraving (1888)" width="758" height="631" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Flammarion.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Flammarion.jpg?resize=300%2C250&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Flammarion.jpg?resize=768%2C639&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The <em>Flammarion engraving</em> (1888) shows a medieval missionary peeking through the Celestial sphere to see heaven itself.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before Newton, no one understood that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">gravity acts universally</a>. Rather, gravity was seen as a force that drew everything to the center of the universe (where Earth was centered).</p>
<p>Accordingly, other worlds were impossible — there would be no force to hold them together.</p>
<p>Though five other planets were known to the ancients, they were not considered worlds. They were seen as celestial entities (or Gods) that moved across the backdrop of the fixed-stars. The word <em>planet</em> is derived from this phenomenon — ‘<em>planetos</em>‘ being Greek for <em>wanderer</em>.</p>
<h3>Our World is one of Many Planets (1543)</h3>
<p>Five-hundred years ago, Copernicus developed a model of planetary motion that assumed Earth and the planets moved around the Sun. Earth was no longer a lone world, but one among five others known at the time: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
<p>But people couldn’t handle expanding reality from one world to six. The Church classified the idea as heresy and in 1616 compelled Galileo to recant under the threat of <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-truth-about-galileo-and-his-conflict-with-the-catholic-church">torture and execution</a></p>
<p>The threat was not to be taken lightly. The Church had just burned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a> at the stake in 1600, partly over his belief that stars are distant suns and that other planets might harbor life of their own.</p>
<h3>Our Sun is one of many Stars (1838)</h3>
<p>Under Copernicus’s model, stars remained as objects that adorned the celestial sphere. The only difference was that this sphere now encased the solar system rather than Earth.</p>
<blockquote><p>TWINKLE, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are!</p></blockquote>
<p>When “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” was published in 1806, it was not just children who wondered what stars were. It was a genuine mystery to science.</p>
<p>It was not until 1838 that Friedrich Bessel found the first evidence that stars are distant suns; or more accurately: that our sun is a nearby star. He used a simple method to prove this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.rg/wiki/Parallax">parallax</a>.</p>
<p>Hold up your index finger and look at it with one eye closed. Then switch: close one eye and open the other still looking at your finger. As you flip back and forth between eyes, your finger seems to shift in its apparent position. That is <em>parallax</em>, and the amount of shift can tell you how far your finger is from your eyes.</p>
<p>Bessel, rather than use the distance between his eyes, used the distance across Earth’s orbit.</p>
<p>He looked at the apparent position of the same star half-a-year apart. In this time Earth travels 2 AU (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2+AU+in+miles&amp;oq=2+AU+in+miles">roughly 185 million miles</a>) from where it was six months prior. This provided sufficient distance for Bessel to detect a Parallax effect for a few of the closest stars. From the shift he determined how far away those stars are.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-104-hubble-parallax.png?resize=758%2C488&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-104-hubble-parallax.png?resize=758%2C488&amp;ssl=1" alt="NASA Parallax Diagram shows how the apparent position of a star will shift ever so slightly as Earth moves about the Sun." width="758" height="488" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-104-hubble-parallax.png?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-104-hubble-parallax.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14-104-hubble-parallax.png?resize=768%2C494&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The apparent position of a star will shift ever so slightly as Earth moves about the Sun.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The distances Bessel obtained from this method were enormous. Even the closest stars were many trillions of miles away. Moreover, each star sat at a different distance. This blew apart the idea of a celestial sphere.</p>
<p>When Bessel estimated how brightly our sun would appear at these distances, he found it in line with the brightness of the stars. This was the first evidence that vast numbers of star systems fill our reality.</p>
<p>Perhaps each star had its own planets, as Bruno hypothesized centuries earlier. Our concept of reality grew.</p>
<h3>Our Galaxy is one of Many Island Universes (1920)</h3>
<p>At the start of the 20th-century telescopes remained near-sighted compared to those of today.</p>
<p>The best telescopes could only see stars within the nearest 10,000 light years (about 10% of the way across the Milky Way Galaxy) — our vision constrained to the local backwater of the galaxy.</p>
<p>We had no idea there were other galaxies. Scientists thought the Milky Way constituted <em>the entire universe.</em></p>
<p>Nearly a century passed since Bessel’s discovery. Our picture of reality was due for another adjustment.</p>
<p>At the time, there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)">debate</a> concerning what these <em>spiral arm nebula</em> really were.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?w=758&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?w=758&amp;ssl=1" alt="A typical &quot;spiral arm nebula&quot;. We know them today as galaxies." data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?resize=768%2C505&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/alwaysasking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/heic1107a-e1589841258105.jpg?resize=120%2C80&amp;ssl=1 120w" data-sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>Most astronomers considered spiral nebula to be clouds of gas. Their name ‘<em>nebula</em>‘ is even Latin for <em>cloud</em>.</p>
<p>A few upstarts subscribed to a fringe idea. They believed these gas clouds constituted entire ‘<em>Island Universes</em>‘ — vast assemblages of stars like our own Milky Way.</p>
<p>In 1920, Edwin Hubble measured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">Doppler effect on the light</a> from these ‘gas clouds’. He found them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law">fleeing from us</a> at speeds so great that they were not gravitationally bound to our galaxy. In other words, if they haven’t already left our galaxy they soon would.</p>
<p>This evidence shifted the debate in favor of the Island Universe Theory, which is today just the standard idea that there are vast numbers of galaxies.</p>
<p>Hubble also found that galaxies move away from each other at speeds proportional to their distance. This strongly suggested space itself is expanding. Rewinding time, everything would be closer together.</p>
<p>This finding set the stage for the next debate in cosmology.</p>
<h2>The Modern View</h2>
<h3>The Observable Universe is tiny part of the Whole (1927)</h3>
<p>If space is expanding and making everything drift apart, then earlier everything would be closer together. Rewind the clock far enough and everything would be squished together at an incredible density.</p>
<p>In 1922, Alexander Friedmann showed how Einstein’s equations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General Relativity</a> could account for an expanding universe. In 1927 Georges Lemaître connected the idea with Hubble’s discovery of expanding space. Lemaître called it <em>The Hypothesis of the Primeval Atom</em>. Today we know it as the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang Theory</a></em>.</p>
<p>Most scientists found the idea of an abrupt creation event inelegant and preferred the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_model">Steady-State theory</a>. </p>
<p>According to this view, the universe was infinitely old, and always expanding. But if new space could be created, why not matter? Steady-State theory supposes that in the wake of newly minted space, new matter is continually created and new galaxies perpetually form to fill the void created by the expansion.</p>
<h4>Ancient Radiation</h4>
<p>This led to a battle between Big Bang proponents and Steady-State theorists.</p>
<p>Both sides lacked evidence to conclusively settle the matter. The debate raged on for decades. But in 1964 evidence finally came in. The Big Bang won.</p>

<p>Two radio astronomers from Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson found a persistent interference in the microwave frequency, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4655517">cosmic hum</a> that seemed to emanate equally from all directions in the sky.</p>
<p>With the aid of physicists from Princeton, they determined the signal had all the predicted characteristics of thermal energy left over from the Big Bang. For their discovery, the pair won a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/cobe_background.html">untuned television set</a> can also detect this signal. About 1% of the static appearing on the screen is due to this radiation. You are seeing energy that traveled for billions of years from the farthest reaches of the observable universe. Only a rare few of these particles are fortunate enough to meet their end on your antenna.</p>
<p>Given the speed at which galaxies are flying apart, we can estimate the Big Bang occurred <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe">13.8 billion years ago</a>. We usually consider ourselves as living in the second millennium, in actuality we’re in the 13,800,000th!</p>
<h4>Where the Big Bang Happened</h4>
<p>If the universe began a finite time ago, does that imply it has a finite size? Not necessarily. </p>
<p>The idea that a finite age implies a finite size stems from a <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm">common misrepresentation</a> that the Big Bang emanated from one particular spot. In truth, it happened everywhere in space, all at once.</p>
<p>If you picked any spot in the universe, the Center of the Milky Way, a distant galaxy, even your own bedroom, you will find in rewinding the clock that all surrounding matter converges there. But the same is true for any point you chose.</p>
<p>Rewinding time, the universe was hotter and denser, but importantly, it was equally hot and dense everywhere. The Big Bang didn’t only happen somewhere far away, <strong><em>it happened right here</em></strong> — in the very space you now occupy. 13.8 billion years ago a plasma filled this spot. And it was so hot that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis">nuclear fusion</a> occurred.</p>
<blockquote><p>The very space you are in now was once as scorching as a hydrogen bomb.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, space has <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/BBhistory.html">expanded and cooled</a> a lot since then. It is now an average of just 2.7°C above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a>. The reason space is not zero degrees is from to the residual warmth of the Big Bang.</p>
<h4>The Size of the Bang</h4>
<p>Given the finite age of the universe, we can see only as far as light has been able to travel in 13.8 billion years.</p>
<p>This constitutes the entirety of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe"><em>observable universe</em></a>. But the observable universe <strong><em>is not</em></strong> the whole; the observable part constantly grows as new light from ever-more distant locations enters view.</p>
<p>So how big is the universe according to the Big Bang theory? How could we ever measure it?</p>
<p>Fortunately, Einstein’s General Relativity provides a way to …</p></div></article></div>

Itâ€™s a probÂ­lem that I have no way to verÂ­ify that the list I used was not cherry-picked for probÂ­lems solved by PhDs. The susÂ­piÂ­cious may want to look for a list of open mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal probÂ­lems pubÂ­lished in a definiÂ­tive form prior to 1995 and reÂ­peat this analÂ­yÂ­sis.</p><p>My model for why a PhD would be necÂ­esÂ­sary to achieve groundÂ­breakÂ­ing work is:</p><blockquote><p>ThÂ­ese deÂ­grees come with credÂ­iÂ­bilÂ­ity; acÂ­cess to exÂ­penÂ­sive equipÂ­ment, fundÂ­ing, and data; acÂ­cess to menÂ­tors and colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors. A smart perÂ­son who sets out to do groundÂ­breakÂ­ing STEM work will have a much lower chance of sucÂ­cess if they donâ€™t acÂ­quire an MD/â€‹PhD. MasÂ­sive, susÂ­tained soÂ­cial coÂ­orÂ­diÂ­naÂ­tion is ~necÂ­esÂ­sary to do groundÂ­breakÂ­ing reÂ­search, and the MD/â€‹PhD pipeline is a core feaÂ­ture of how we do that. Without that deÂ­gree, grant writÂ­ers wonâ€™t make grants. ColÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors wonâ€™t want to inÂ­vest in the reÂ­laÂ­tionÂ­ship. It will be exÂ­tremely difficult to conÂ­vince anyÂ­body to let someÂ­one withÂ­out a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree run a reÂ­search proÂ­gram.</p></blockquote><p>AuthorÂ­iÂ­taÂ­tiveÂ­ness of the proof, acÂ­cess to exÂ­penÂ­sive equipÂ­ment, and acÂ­cess to data donâ€™t seem to be very much at play in mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies.</p><p>PerÂ­haps the reaÂ­son these mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans enÂ­rolÂ­led in their PhD is that the acaÂ­demic enÂ­viÂ­ronÂ­ment is both conÂ­venÂ­tional and atÂ­tracÂ­tive for geÂ­nius mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­ciÂ­ans, even though itâ€™s not acÂ­tuÂ­ally necÂ­esÂ­sary for them to do their work. My guess is that fundÂ­ing, the sense of seÂ­cuÂ­rity that comes with earnÂ­ing creÂ­denÂ­tials alÂ­lows risk-takÂ­ing, and acÂ­cess to long-term colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors and menÂ­tors also play an imÂ­porÂ­tant role.</p><p>37 of the disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies (46%) are credÂ­ited to a sinÂ­gle mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cian, givÂ­ing some perÂ­specÂ­tive on the exÂ­tent to which acÂ­cess to colÂ­labÂ­oÂ­raÂ­tors is imÂ­porÂ­tant.</p><p>How did the two inÂ­venÂ­tors of Boyleâ€™s <i>desiderÂ­ata </i>who didnâ€™t hold a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree manÂ­age to do their work withÂ­out a PhD? The fact that they both worked in the field of robotics seems releÂ­vant.</p><p>Maybe the story is someÂ­thing like this:</p><p>EarnÂ­ing a PhD is both atÂ­tracÂ­tive and helpful for peoÂ­ple doÂ­ing baÂ­sic reÂ­search in esÂ­tabÂ­lished fields.</p><p>A PhD is less imÂ­porÂ­tant for doÂ­ing groundÂ­breakÂ­ing apÂ­plied enÂ­gÂ­ineerÂ­ing and enÂ­trepreneurial work, esÂ­peÂ­cially in tech.</p><p>Itâ€™s hard to overÂ­state the exÂ­tent to which busiÂ­ness conÂ­tributes to acaÂ­demic work. How many mathÂ­eÂ­matÂ­iÂ­cal, biologÂ­iÂ­cal, and physÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­covÂ­erÂ­ies would never have been made, if it werenâ€™t for robotics (inÂ­vented by someÂ­one with no higher edÂ­uÂ­caÂ­tion) and cheap comÂ­pute (proÂ­vided by the busiÂ­ness secÂ­tor)? How much has ecoÂ­nomic growth exÂ­panded our soÂ­cietyâ€™s caÂ­pacÂ­ity to fund acaÂ­demic reÂ­search?</p><p><strong>ConÂ­cluÂ­sion:</strong></p><p>Letâ€™s think about the situÂ­aÂ­tion of a STEM stuÂ­dent with lots of poÂ­tenÂ­tial, but no money and few acÂ­comÂ­plishÂ­ments.</p><p>If they do a PhD, theyâ€™ll get enough money to live on, and some time and menÂ­torÂ­ship to try and prove their inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship abilÂ­ities. ComÂ­ing out of it, theyâ€™ll have a terÂ­miÂ­nal deÂ­gree, which will give them the opÂ­tion of conÂ­tinÂ­uÂ­ing in academia if they like it, or leavÂ­ing for inÂ­dusÂ­try if they donâ€™t.</p><p>If they go straight into inÂ­dusÂ­try withÂ­out a PhD, they might earn more money early on. But theyâ€™ll also have to work their way up from near the botÂ­tom, unÂ­less they can join a small startup early on. They might get caught in the imÂ­moral maze of some giÂ­ganÂ­tic corÂ­poÂ­raÂ­tion. They wonâ€™t have the same leeÂ­way a PhD stuÂ­dent has to choose their own proÂ­ject. And they likely wonâ€™t have the same long-term earnÂ­ing poÂ­tenÂ­tial.</p><p>From that point of view, the PhD conÂ­cept itÂ­self doesnâ€™t seem like empty creÂ­denÂ­tialÂ­ism. InÂ­stead, itâ€™s a mechanism for siftÂ­ing through the many bright young peoÂ­ple our soÂ­ciety proÂ­duces, givÂ­ing a cerÂ­tain perÂ­centage of them a boost toÂ­ward inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual leadÂ­erÂ­ship and a chance to take a crack at a baÂ­sic reÂ­search probÂ­lem. Itâ€™s also a form of diÂ­verÂ­sifiÂ­caÂ­tion, a soÂ­cietal hedge against an overly short-term, profit-oriÂ­ented, comÂ­mons-neÂ­glectÂ­ing capÂ­iÂ­talÂ­ist apÂ­proach to R&amp;D.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Monocypher has been audited by Cure53 in June 2020.</p><div>
  <p>After spending six days on the Monocypher scope during this June 2020
project, two members of the Cure53 team can confirm that the provided
C code held well to their scrutiny. Few findings with limited
severities evidence a good security premise of Monocypher. What is
more, the code is exceptionally clean and demonstrates a clear focus
on security features. It relates to typical targets around embedded
environments, for instance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations.</p>

<p>The findings highlight some exceptions linked to undocumented behavior
(MON-01-001) and a minor lack of rigor in test vectors
(MON-01-004). Beyond these, no serious issues were found in the
Monocypher code itself. However, some issues were spotted in the
cryptographic library design (see MON-01-005 and MON-01-002). Finally,
the Monokex protocol suite’s specification was found to be lacking
critical details on the behavior of its Message Authentication Codes
(MON-01-006). In the same realm, Cure53 also points out the necessity
to justify its relatively bareboned key derivation mechanism (MON-01-
003).</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the Monocypher code is well-written and supported
by clean, documented code and a suitable amount of test vectors, the
high-level design of the Monocypher’s developer-exposed API could use
more refinement (MON-01-005), as could the specification of the
Monokex suite of protocols (MON-01-006, MON-01-003).  Since no issues
of <em>High-</em> or <em>Critical-</em>severity could be spotted in the timeframe
available for this audit, Cure53 concludes this 2020 assessment on a
positive note.</p>

<p>Cure53 would like to thank Loup Vaillant-David who maintains
Monocypher for his excellent project coordination, support and
assistance, both before and during this assignment. Special gratitude
needs to be extended to Open Technology Fund Washington for sponsoring
this project.</p>
</div><p>I personally would like to thank Cure53 for their care and
professionalism.  Working with them was a pleasure.  Also big thanks to
the <a href="https://www.opentech.fund/">Open Technology Fund</a> for financing the
audit.</p></div>]]>

					<h3>Introduction / Warning</h3>
<p>Any traditional introductory statistics course will teach students the definitions of modes, medians and means. But, because introductory courses can’t assume that students have much mathematical maturity, the close relationship between these three summary statistics can’t be made clear. This post tries to remedy that situation by making it clear that all three concepts arise as specific parameterizations of a more general problem.</p>
<p>To do so, I’ll need to introduce one non-standard definition that may trouble some readers. In order to simplify my exposition, let’s all agree to assume that \(0^0 = 0\). In particular, we’ll want to assume that \(|0|^0 = 0\), even though \(|\epsilon|^0 = 1\) for all \(\epsilon &gt; 0\). This definition is non-standard, but it greatly simplifies what follows and emphasizes the conceptual unity of modes, medians and means.</p>
<h3>Constructing a Summary Statistic</h3>
<p>To see how modes, medians and means arise, let’s assume that we have a list of numbers, \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), that we want to summarize. We want our summary to be a single number, which we’ll call \(s\). How should we select \(s\) so that it summarizes the numbers,  \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)\), effectively?</p>
<p>To answer that, we’ll assume that \(s\) is an effective summary of the entire list if the typical discrepancy between \(s\) and each of the \(x_i\) is small. With that assumption in place, we only need to do two things: (1) define the notion of discrepancy between two numbers, \(x_i\) and \(s\);  and (2) define the notion of a typical discrepancy. Because each number \(x_i\) produces its own discrepancy, we’ll need to introduce a method for aggregating the individual discrepancies to order to say something about the typical discrepancy.</p>
<h3>Defining a Discrepancy</h3>
<p>We could define the discrepancy between a number \(x_i\) and another number \(s\) in many ways. For now, we’ll consider only three possibilities. All of these three options satisfies a basic intuition we have about the notion of discrepancy: we expect that the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) should be \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| = 0\) and that the discrepancy should be greater than \(0\) if \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\). That leaves us with one obvious question: how much greater should the discrepancy be when \(|x_i – s| &gt; 0\)?</p>
<p>To answer that question, let’s consider three definitions of the discrepancy, \(d_i\):</p>
<ol>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>How should we think about these three possible definitions?</p>
<p>The first definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^0\), says that the discrepancy is \(1\) if \(x_i \neq s\) and is \(0\) only when \(x_i = s\). This notion of discrepancy is typically called <b>zero-one loss</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that anything other than exact equality produces a constant measure of discrepancy. Summarizing \(x_i = 2\) with \(s = 0\) is no better nor worse than using \(s = 1\). In other words, the discrepancy does not increase at all as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). You can see this reflected in the far-left column of the image below:</p>
<center><br>
<img src="http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/discrepancy1.png" alt="Discrepancy" title="discrepancy.png" width="800" height="466"><br>
</center>
<p>The second definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^1\), says that the discrepancy is equal to the distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called an <b>absolute deviation</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). This is reflected in the center column of the image above.</p>
<p>The third definition, \(d_i = |x_i – s|^2\), says that the discrepancy is the squared distance between \(x_i\) and \(s\). This is often called a <b>squared error</b> in machine learning. Note that this definition implies that the discrepancy should increase super-linearly as \(s\) gets further and further from \(x_i\). For example, if \(x_i = 1\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(1\). But if \(x_i = 2\) and \(s = 0\), then the discrepancy is \(4\). This is reflected in the far right column of the image above.</p>
<p>When we consider a list with a single element, \((x_1)\), these definitions all suggest that we should choose the same number: namely, \(s = x_1\).</p>
<h3>Aggregating Discrepancies</h3>
<p>Although these definitions do not differ for a list with a single element, they suggest using very different summaries of a list with more than one number in it. To see why, let’s first assume that we’ll aggregate the discrepancy between \(x_i\) and \(s\) for each of the \(x_i\) into a single summary of the quality of a proposed value of \(s\). To perform this aggregation, we’ll sum up the discrepancies over each of the \(x_i\) and call the result \(E\).</p>
<p>In that case, our three definitions give three interestingly different possible definitions of the typical discrepancy, which we’ll call \(E\) for error:<br>
$$<br>
E_0 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_1 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$</p>
<p>$$<br>
E_2 = \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2.<br>
$$</p>
<p>When we write down these expressions in isolation, they don’t look very different. But if we select \(s\) to minimize each of these three types of errors, we get very different numbers. And, surprisingly, each of these three numbers will be very familiar to us.</p>
<h3>Minimizing Aggregate Discrepancies</h3>
<p>For example, suppose that we try to find \(s_0\) that minimizes the zero-one loss definition of the error of a single number summary. In that case, we require that,<br>
$$<br>
s_0 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0.<br>
$$<br>
What value should \(s_0\) take on? If you give this some extended thought, you’ll discover two things: (1) there is not necessarily a single best value of \(s_0\), but potentially many different values; and (2) each of these best values is one of the <b>modes</b> of the \(x_i\).</p>
<p>In other words, the best single number summary of a set of numbers, when you use exact equality as your metric of error, is one of the modes of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>What happens if we consider some of the other definitions? Let’s start by considering \(s_1\):<br>
$$<br>
s_1 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1.<br>
$$<br>
Unlike \(s_0\), \(s_1\) is a unique number: it is the <b>median</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use absolute differences as your metric of error, is the median of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>Since we’ve just found that the mode and the median appear naturally, we might wonder if other familiar basic statistics will appear. Luckily, they will. If we look for,<br>
$$<br>
s_2 = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2,<br>
$$<br>
we’ll find that, like \(s_1\), \(s_2\) is again a unique number. Moreover, \(s_2\) is the <b>mean</b> of the \(x_i\). That is, the best summary of a set of numbers, when you use squared differences as your metric of error, is the mean of that set of numbers.</p>
<p>To sum up, we’ve just seen that the three most famous single number summaries of a data set are very closely related: they all minimize the average discrepancy between \(s\) and the numbers being summarized. They only differ in the type of discrepancy being considered:</p>
<ol>
<li>The mode minimizes the number of times that one of the numbers in our summarized list is not equal to the summary that we use.</li>
<li>The median minimizes the average distance between each number and our summary.</li>
<li>The mean minimizes the average squared distance between each number and our summary.</li>
</ol>
<p>In equations,</p>
<ol>
<li>\(\text{The mode of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^0\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The median of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^1\)</li>
<li>\(\text{The mean of } x_i = \arg \min_{s} \sum_{i} |x_i – s|^2\)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We’ve just seen that the mode, median and mean all arise from a simple parametric process in which we try to minimize the average discrepancy between a single number \(s\) and a list of numbers, \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) that we try to summarize using \(s\). In a future blog post, I’ll describe how the ideas we’ve just introduced relate to the concept of \(L_p\) norms. Thinking about minimizing \(L_p\) norms is a generalization of taking modes, medians and means that leads to almost every important linear method in statistics — ranging from linear regression to the SVD.</p>

  <p><time datetime="2018-08-24T22:09:09+1000">Fri, Aug 24, 2018</time></p><p><strong>update 31/08/2018</strong> - <em>moved “Libraries” section into a <a href="https://pl-rants.net/posts/libraries-vs/">separate post</a></em></p>

<p>A couple of years ago I read the paper <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/HaskellVsAda-NSWC.pdf">Haskell vs. Ada vs. C++ vs. AWK
vs. …</a>
which left me under impression that Haskell might be a great choice for
prototyping. Since then I did a few toy projects in Haskell, read <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/1316626229">Programming in
Haskell</a>
(which I found absolutely marvelous) but it was hard to come across a real-world
project where I could verify the claim.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I finally got the chance. The team I am a part of, apart from
writing totally awesome things in Elixir/Erlang in between times maintains
tremendous amount of legacy tools written in Perl with some bits of Python. One of
the tools is responsible for daily querying a bunch of <a href="https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/doc/rrdtool.en.html">RRD
files</a> using Perl, enriching
the data with some metadata using Python and dumping it all into a single <code>.csv</code>
file with all the metrics collected on the previous day. And when I say “a bunch”
that means almost a million in some cases. No one really looked at the tool for
years until the number of files to process has increased 4x times up to 800000
overnight. The tool could not keep up effectively making the daily reports
unusable. A temporary workaround was to run the tool on a beefy 24-core (with
only one core actually utilised) 2x CPU 128GB RAM HP Gen9 blade which was able
run the thing in 9 hours.</p>

<p>It just so happened that when the problem manifested itself I was chatting with
my boss about how awesome Haskell was and how OCaml was <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack">the implementation
language of choice</a> for
some modern programming languages and how most software developers unreasonably
turn a blind eye to their great merits. And the boss - otherwise being
absolutely rational and pragmatic person - said that my wet dream might have
come true and I was to rewrite that tool in Haskell. While I was making some
finishing touches to the project I was on at the moment, eagerly awaiting for
the <strong>Haskell Rewrite Project</strong> to start, the other team member found… let’s
say an anti-pattern in Python part of the tool reducing 8 hours of Python
crunching to 20 minutes thus bringing the total run time of the tool down to 1
hour and 20 minutes. That eliminated the true to life business justification of
the rewrite. However, my boss - being <em>one of the most awesome bosses around</em> -
allowed me to start the project and prototype the tool in Haskell under
condition that I also were to write a prototype in Go and had it all done within
a week. After that I would have to present the results of the experiment to the
team. I love challenges and I wanted some hands-on experience with Go (which I
knew nothing about at that moment) so I happily accepted those conditions.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>In the nutshell the problem can be described as following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>parse command line arguments to gather parameters about DB connection, in-out
folders/files and something called device groups</p></li>

<li><p>query the required set of devices and relevant metadata from the MySQL database</p></li>

<li><p>based on the device set deduce the list of RRD files</p></li>

<li><p>for each file in the file set query data points for the 12:00AM - 11:55PM interval
of the previous day</p></li>

<li><p>dump every data point using human-readable metric name, device name,
etc. as a row to the specified <code>.csv</code> file</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tl-dr-or-comparison-table">TL;DR or comparison table</h2>

<p><strong>update 17/09/2018</strong> - added multiprocess OCaml and Go+goroutines results</p>

<p><strong>update 28/10/2018</strong> - added async OCaml results</p>

<p>Go version straight out of the box demonstrated the best performance. Haskell
version after some tinkering came second, and OCaml version while being slower
than the other two was the best in memory consumption.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Go routines or any other concurrency/parallelism techniques in
either version because I wanted a fair comparison with the Perl/Python version
and also wanted as simple solution as possible. Go and Haskell used parallel GC
though, so comparison was not completely fair.</p>

<p>Also it is worth noting that Go version used <code>librrd</code> wrapper and consequently
skipped parsing of <code>rrdtool</code> output altogether.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Run time</code> is how long it took to process those 800000 files.</li>
<li><code>Memory</code> is the maximum memory consumption for the file set.</li>
<li><code>LOC</code> is the number of lines of code including imports.</li>

<li><p><code>Size</code> is the executable file size (everything linked statically).</p></li>

<li><p><code>Build time</code> is how long it takes to rebuild the executable. All versions but
<code>OCaml + glob</code> have only one file. The build time does not take into account
building any extra dependencies.</p></li>

<li><p><code>Impl time</code> is how many hours (approximately) it took me to implement a version.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I used the latest stable version of compilers. That is Go 1.10.4, GHC 8.4.3,
OCaml 4.07.0. I also tried compiling with GHC 8.2 and OCaml 4.0.5 but results
were consistent across versions.</p>

<h2 id="go-version">Go version</h2>

<p>Go had to be the first one because I was not sure if I would be able to
complete it in time and wanted as much leeway as possible. I started with <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A
Tour of Go</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">some other
tutorials</a> which consumed one weekend
of my time. I excluded that time from the table above because I already had some
experience with Haskell and OCaml and taking the time into account did not seem fair.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Go’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>I found tooling being very good, easy to use, fast. Most things just worked out
of the box. There is a single entry point - <code>go</code> command - which allows to
build/install/remove packages and executables.</p>

<p>What I liked the most (although it’s probably irrelevant for many) is that
setting up Emacs environment took me only 30-40 minutes. <code>go-mode</code>, <code>go-eldoc</code>,
<code>go-autocomplete</code>, <code>go-rename</code> required little to no extra tweaking delivering
a very pleasant, virtually bug-free development experience. I especially liked
<code>go-playground</code> which provided me with almost repl-like functionality.</p>

<p>Documentation for the language, the standard library, tools, third-party
packages is extremely good. It is approachable being beginner-friendly but
comprehensive at the same time.</p>

<p>To sum it up: excellent.</p>

<h3 id="go-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Go’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Go was easy to set up, easy to use. Abundance of documentation and ready-to-use
libraries written clearly and concisely helped a lot. Language-wise I had
experience not dissimilar to what I had with AWK as a code-gen tool for a bigger
C project - somewhat awkward but straightforward - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS
principle</a> at its fullest. I think
it is a good language that anyone can start hacking without having to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Category-Theory-Oxford-Logic-Guides/dp/0199237182">a
Category Theory
book</a>.</p>

<p>The flip side of the coin is not that bright I am afraid. There is no a standard
way (at time of this writing at least) to lock dependencies. It is not a problem
for small one-off projects, but I can’t image how people are able to
develop/maintain larger code bases without falling into <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/Survival">cabal
hell</a>. Not dissimilar to Haskell, NixOS
could be an answer to that problem.</p>

<p>Another observation, and it does stand out, especially after Haskell experience,
is that language-wise it feels like a “can I have a C (or AWK) but without this
and that annoyances please?“. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I’ve got
mixed feelings about it and will probably write a post or two to get
into more details.</p>

<h2 id="haskell-version">Haskell version</h2>

<p>To evaluate Haskell in that semi-production setting was the main goal of the
experiment. I knew enough of the language to start writing code straight away
but I wanted to measure how productive I would be (and how much faster the tool
would become). The only problem was that I had only two days left to answer the
question.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-tools-ecosystem-documentation">Haskell’s tools, ecosystem, documentation</h3>

<p>Back In 2016 <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode"><code>haskell-mode</code></a> with
<code>interactive-haskell-mode</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode"><code>structured-haskell-mode</code></a>
for Emacs provided well-rounded development environment. I am not sure what has
changed since then but I could not glue it all together and spent at least three
hours trying the setup. I ended up using
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/intero"><code>intero-mode</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/lspitzner/brittany"><code>brittany</code></a> for code formatting. It
worked reasonably well but determining a highlighted expression type, especially
if it involved polymorphic functions was highly unreliable. I had to use
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes">typed holes</a> all the time. Worst
of all was that repl within Emacs tend to produce some scary error messages -
“unfathomable operation” or something along the lines - every time I called
anything IO-related. I had to run the repl in the terminal to avoid that.</p>

<p>Documentation is scarce at best. Most libraries provide but a few pointers or
remarks for the authors themselves rather than a comprehensive documentations,
let alone “getting started” guides or tutorials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a> is your friend and works fine from
command line/Emacs. It has been invaluable and I wish all languages would
provide something like that. The problem, however, is those
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a> pages are hard to
navigate. “Synopsys” is useless when there are more than a handful of functions
(which is true in most cases) because it does not scroll, effectively displaying
only first 10-15 items. I ended up using <a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a> from
Emacs because it was the only sane way to navigate through e.g. 100+ functions in
ByteString library.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">stack</a> was OK. I think it
has become even better over the past two years. My only gripe is that it lacks
<code>search</code> command and something like <code>deps fetch/update/remove</code> to simplify
handling of dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="haskell-s-overall-impression-and-thoughts">Haskell’s overall impression and thoughts</h3>

<p>Using Haskell was surprisingly hard. When searching for information scattered
through <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell">Haskell Wiki</a>, StackOverflow posts
and multiple blogs I felt more like a detective or investigator rather than a
software engineer. Had I had something akin to <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World
Haskell</a> but up to date, the whole process
could have been smoother. Alas I had not and I struggled.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The impact on middleware of expanding APIs with Go's interface smuggling</h2>

	<p><small>July 10, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Recently, the Go blog had <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-compatibility">Keeping your Modules Compatible</a> which is about
doing exactly that as you add features and want to expand your
module's API. When the module's API involves interfaces, one of
the approaches they suggested is what I've called <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoInterfaceSmuggling">interface
smuggling</a> and what other people have
called <em>interface upgrades</em>. Let me quote the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you run into a case where you want to add a method to an existing
interface, you may be able to follow this strategy. Start by creating
a new interface with your new method, or identify an existing
interface with the new method. Next, identify the relevant functions
that need to support it, type check for the second interface, and add
code that uses it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quite popular approach, one used by many packages in Go's
standard library and third party packages. However, it has a dark
side, and that is its unfortunate effects on middleware.</p>

<p>The problem for middleware is best illustrated by the most common
sort of middleware, which is things that interpose in the chain of
HTTP handlers to modify the results. Much middleware wants to look
at or act on some aspect of the HTTP reply, for example <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoPrometheusMetricLabels">to gather
metrics based on the result code</a>, which
means that it must modify and proxy the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter"><code>http.ResponseWriter</code></a> passed to child
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Handler"><code>http.Handler</code></a>s. Over
time the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a> has
acquired a whole collection of smuggled interfaces on ResponseWriters,
such as <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#CloseNotifier"><code>http.CloseNotifier</code></a> (which is deprecated),
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Flusher"><code>http.Flusher</code></a>,
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker"><code>http.Hijacker</code></a>, and
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Pusher"><code>http.Pusher</code></a>. In the
future there will probably be more.</p>

<p>(In addition, the ResponseWriter may or may not support
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReaderFrom"><code>io.ReaderFrom</code></a>.)</p>

<p>If you're a piece of middleware, the ResponseWriter you're passed
may support some, many, or all of these additional APIs. However,
Go provides you no good way to pass this support through your proxy
ResponseWriter that you're going to pass to children Handlers. The
Prometheus people try hard to do it anyway, and <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/prometheus/promhttp/delegator.go">the result is
rather messy</a>
and involves a combinatorial explosion of the possible combinations
of APIs. As the case of io.ReaderFrom shows, these additional APIs
don't even necessarily come from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>http</code> package</a>. A smuggled
interface from anywhere may need to be supported.</p>

<p>One answer to this is that you just don't support these additional
APIs in your middleware, or you only support a few of them. The
problem with this is that the ResponseWriter and the client code
that people are trying to use your middleware with well have been
developed, tested, and normally used in an environment where these
expanded APIs are used, not cut off. As we all know, if you don't
test it it doesn't work. Your middleware may be the first code to
try to pass the next hop a ResponseWriter with a genuinely narrow
API, because such narrow APIs may mostly come from middleware. And
of course if there are any bugs in the result, people will blame
your middleware.</p>

<p>None of this is insurmountable. But beyond the problems and the
hassles, it means that expanding your API with interface smuggling
is decidedly not transparent if people use middleware with it. And
as a practical matter, some amount of the time your new API will
not be usable until middleware is expanded to cope with it (if it
ever is).</p>

<p>Another problem is that this expansion of middleware to cope with
your new API can't happen until your new API itself is pervasive.
Go currently provides no support for conditional building based on
the version of other packages or the state of their API, so middleware
can't include any use of your new API interfaces until it doesn't
have to build against versions of your package that predate them.</p>

<p>(People can work around this for HTTP middleware because they can
make files build only on specific minimum versions of Go. Your
package doesn't have this magical power; it's something available
only for new APIs in the Go standard library.)</p>

<p>Because nothing is new under the sun, this problem was noticed back
in 2014's <a href="https://avtok.com/2014/11/05/interface-upgrades.html">Interface Upgrades in Go</a>, which is
one of the earliest places to call this pattern an 'interface
upgrade'. The article notes the proxy problem and ends with a call
to use interface upgrades sparingly. This is good advice in my
opinion, but is very much at odds with the idea of routinely using
interface upgrades to expand your API.</p>

<![CDATA[Use Hugo to Update Your GitHub Profile]]>
            </title>

<br/>
July 10, 2020 | https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://roytang.net/2020/07/hugo-update-github-profile/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>So recently Github secretly rolled out a new feature where you can create a file named <code>README.md</code> in a repo named <code>github.com/&lt;your github username&gt;/&lt;your github username&gt;</code>, and that markdown file would be rendered on your Github profile page. It means, you can now put basically anything you want on your Github profile!</p>
<p>I just read this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/">post from Simon Willson</a> about using this new feature + Github actions and a Python script to automatically generate and update his Github profile. That seemed neat so I thought about how I would do it.</p>
<p>My blog is already setup to publish using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> whenever I push a commit, so I figured I could just ride on that framework. You can already see this in action on <a href="https://github.com/roytang">my Github profile page</a>! Basically, I publish the <code>README.md</code> using my regular Hugo build, then my Travis script will deploy it to the appropriate repo.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Hugo, the trickiest part of this might be using a custom output format to generate the README.md. This is basically just a bunch of settings in your Hugo config file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define a new Markdown media type under <code>mediaTypes</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">    [<span>mediaTypes</span>]
        [<span>mediaTypes</span>.<span>"text/markdown"</span>]
            <span>suffixes</span> = [<span>"md"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define a “readme” output format (or whatever you want to name it) under <code>outputFormats</code> in your config file. For a TOML config file, that looks like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputFormats</span>]
  [<span>outputFormats</span>.<span>readme</span>]
    <span>baseName</span> = <span>"README"</span>
    <span>mediaType</span> = <span>"text/markdown"</span>    </code></pre></div> The <code>baseName</code> here controls the output file name, while the extension is controlled by the suffixes in step 1. The <code>mediaType</code> you use here should match the one in step 1.
</li>
<li>
<p>Next is to specify which pages should have this custom output format. I used my home page for this, so under <code>outputs</code> in the config file I added the name of the output format (“readme”) in my case under “home”:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="toml">[<span>outputs</span>]
  <span>home</span> = [<span>"HTML"</span>, <span>"RSS"</span>, <span>"jsonfeed"</span>, <span>"hfeed"</span>, <span>"readme"</span>]</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last step, in your theme or your layouts folder, create a file named <code>index.README.md</code>. This will be the template used to generate the README file. Remember that this is a template to generate markdown. You can use all the normal Hugo template functions, but your output should be markdown. Here’s part of what I put in my template, which generates a list of my most recent blog posts:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go-html-template">Latest blog posts:
<span>{{</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>:=</span> <span>first</span> <span>5</span> <span>(</span><span>where</span> <span>site</span><span>.RegularPages</span> <span>"Type"</span> <span>"post"</span><span>)</span> <span>}}</span>    
<span>{{</span> <span>range</span> <span>$pages</span> <span>}}</span>
- [<span>{{</span> <span>.Title</span> <span>}}</span>](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>)<span>{{</span> <span>end</span> <span>}}</span>

[View all posts](<span>{{</span> <span>.Permalink</span> <span>}}</span>blog)</code></pre></div> If you’re not yet too familiar with Hugo templates, you can maybe just use the above example directly first to see what it outputs. (You might need to replace <code>post</code> with <code>posts</code> or whatever your main post type is).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have these setup, just run your usual hugo build and check the output folder to see if the README.md file was generated correctly. It should be in the root of the output folder, same place as the <code>index.html</code> for your home page. One problem I encountered with Hugo is that it insists on lowercasing all the output files, so the output file in my case is always <code>readme.md</code> and not <code>README.md</code>. I just solved this by renaming it during the Travis build.</p>
<p>I won’t discuss the travis deployment process anymore here; if you’ve done CI with Travis and Github integration before, it’s relatively straightforward to add a step to copy the readme file from the Hugo build output to the appropriate repository.</p>
<p>After setting this up, my Github profile page now automatically updates with my latest blog posts/notes/shared links! (I didn’t include photos to keep things simple). The update happens every time my site itself gets a new build, so that’s pretty neat. I’ve attached an image of the new Github profile page for reference!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! 👋 If you have been following my blog then you might have already read <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">the article</a> on reverse engineering an Android app by writing custom smali code. I am still very much a reverse engineering beginner so after that article, I got to learn about Frida. I was told that Frida is much faster and a lot easier for scenarios where I want to snoop on functions. Well, I am glad to report that all the suggestions were absolutely correct.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share some details about how I was able to use it to snoop around the Nike Run Club Android app. The final goal was to extract authentication tokens that Nike generates when you log-in. This was another project on the backburner and what better way to get a project off the back burner by learning something new?</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/rVbAzUUSUC6dO/giphy.gif" alt="Excited"></p>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>

<p>I am an avid runner. Most of my friends and family know that. When I started this sport I got hooked to Nike Run Club. I used to diligently record each run so that I had a record for all my runs. This went on for 2 years until I found out that most of my new running friends were using Strava. I decided to move over to Strava but was pretty bummed by the lack of data export options in NRC.</p>

<p>There were <a href="https://gist.github.com/niw/858c1ecaef89858893681e46db63db66">documents online</a> about the Nike API and they allowed you to also export your data in the JSON format but I wanted something a bit more automated. Therefore, I decided to do what any other insane person would do and started my journey of reverse-engineering the Nike Run Club APK. I decided to go to the source and figure out if I could reverse engineer the login process and generate tokens in a completely automated fashion.</p>

<p>This article will teach you the basic usage of Frida and how you too can go ahead and snoop around different APKs. But before we go to that part, you need to know how I ended up deciding to reverse engineer the app and not simply do a MITM attack using <code>mitmproxy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="intercept-nrc-traffic">Intercept NRC traffic</h2>

<p>When I started the project, I decided to snoop the traffic using <code>mitmproxy</code>. You can download the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> to follow along. After downloading it, rename it to <code>nike.apk</code> so that the rest of the commands in this tutorial are version agnostic.</p>

<p>Next, you can use <code>adb</code> to install this APK on the emulator:</p>

<pre><code>$ adb install nike.apk
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you need to run <code>mitmproxy</code>. If you struggle with setting up an emulator or the proxy, refer to <a href="https://yasoob.me/posts/reverse-engineering-android-apps-apktool/">this previous article</a> of mine where I go in slightly more detail about how to do these things. I used the following command to run mitmproxy:</p>

<pre><code>$ mitmproxy --set block_global=false --showhost
</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is to install <code>mitmproxy</code> system certificates on the Android emulator by following the <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-install-system-trusted-ca-android/">official docs</a> and point the emulator to your local <code>mitmproxy</code> instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dd41762550fb0ba98ccba6d98a82f2f31ed30e8e/22386/images/android-re/emulator.png" alt="Emulator proxy settings"></p>

<p>After this setup, I opened up NRC and started checking out the requests in mitmproxy. I was kinda surprised and pretty spooked by the number of analytics requests NRC was sending. There was no SSL pinning in place so I didn’t have to do anything special before all requests started showing up. All these 68 requests were before I even signed in:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7ace7aada69a0d6a0ed5eeaab40af9fb3292ce8c/199ba/images/android-re/mitmproxy-nike-all.png" alt="mitmproxy all requests"></p>

<p>When I tried signing in, I saw this login request:</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d1612f6255723b63669f77bd985fcf4d326a1db2/3cac0/images/android-re/mitmproxy-login-request.png" alt="Login request"></p>

<p>It looks like a legit login request. But what is that <code>client_id</code>? Everything else seems reasonable and is something we can produce on our own but the <code>client_id</code> seems pretty <em>unique</em>. Where is it coming from?</p>

<p>I checked out a couple of requests before and after this particular API call and couldn’t find the <code>client_id</code> anywhere. It had to be generated within the APK itself. I tried replaying the request a couple of times in <code>mitmproxy</code> and it started failing after 2-3 successful replays. I started receiving this response:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;Access Denied&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
  &lt;H1&gt;Access Denied&lt;/H1&gt;
    You don't have permission to access "http://unite.nike.com/login?" on this server.
  &lt;P&gt;
    Reference #18.2eaf3817.1593493058.26b69156
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There was something dynamic in the request and I just had to figure out what. This was the perfect excuse to start snooping inside the NRC app.</p>

<p>By the way, the NRC app makes heavy use of HTML in their app. The login page is actually an HTML document and is loaded from the server. You can access it at <a href="https://unite.nike.com/s3/unite/mobile.html?androidSDKVersion=3.1.0&amp;corsoverride=https://unite.nike.com&amp;uxid=com.nike.sport.running.droid.3.8&amp;locale=en_US&amp;backendEnvironment=identity&amp;view=login&amp;clientId=WLr1eIG5JSNNcBJM3npVa6L76MK8OBTt&amp;facebookAppId=84697719333&amp;wechatAppId=wxde7d0246cfaf32f7">this url</a>. More about this later.</p>

<h2 id="decompile-nrc-apk">Decompile NRC APK</h2>

<p>I assume you already downloaded the NRC APK from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/nike-inc/nike-run-club/nike-run-club-3-9-1-release/nike-run-club-3-9-1-2-android-apk-download/">APKMirror</a> and renamed it to <code>nike.apk</code>. I uploaded the APK to <a href="http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk">this online version of jadx</a> and decompiled it. We are on the hunt for the <code>client_id</code> and the first thing I do whenever I am trying to find a string, I use grep:</p>

<pre><code>$ grep -r `client_id` ./
</code></pre>

<p>Ooo it did output quite a bunch of stuff. This seems to be the most interesting string:</p>

<pre><code>./resources/res/values/strings.xml:    &lt;string name="unite_client_id"&gt;IFc97q8fSoR84EHfevnzBNivAiT6H+i8vmVZDnCAax/ZjSGxw5ejdekfXtCrzrtJrQfJnj30JeK+MsyruZi8sW6iUBfe//NGZlpQJXUbz8LuPEXnLMAlxKdLV6BrBgKHqNI94nfSHCCr0xW3HOZk/XyFdevndG52zmZR0XXym0yW5d8n/XvLGDCtVyryFLYoYwHYrDC9JZ+GfAacPKE5S437fT9Af+Z/AeZgqPplm9mCaPBoOc0Co4+h3nT8TvXMsU4Vy8pRTuWv0skMU0uwUkq7R/UN06daQ8AkAaYt7KWG0S36tSbHuR03ji7om8ebOJqOzgFyYOp/KfkHkvX5+PVk2lG7lk1hBltitrBND8njmHHIPisC6+W7Ul1an0mRiNTQVFfSJpyNUVvE1D17NQ==&lt;/string&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><code>grep</code> also told me where it was being decrypted:</p>

<pre><code>./sources/com/nike/plusgps/login/UniteConfigFactory.java:        UniteConfig uniteConfig = new UniteConfig(this.userAgentHeader.getUserAgent(), this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_experience_id), this.obfuscator.decrypt(this.appResources.getString(C5369R.string.unite_client_id)));
</code></pre>

<p>Based on my previous experience with encryption, this seems to be an AES encrypted string. But I need to make sure this is the actual <code>client_id</code> we saw in the request. Time to use Frida and hook into the APK and figure out what the decrypted value of this string is.</p>

<h2 id="intro-to-frida">Intro to Frida</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://frida.re/">official website</a>, Frida is a</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic instrumentation toolkit for developers, reverse-engineers, and security researchers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It allows you to inject scripts in native applications and check out what they are doing under the hood. We will be using it to keep a tab on method inputs in the NRC APK and also make custom calls to different methods. Before we move any further, let’s install Frida first.</p>

<h3 id="frida-installation">Frida installation</h3>

<p>There are two parts of Frida (that I am aware of). Frida client and Frida server. The client runs on the host operating system and the server runs of the Android/iOS device. To make testing easier, it is much better to use an Android emulator with Frida.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-client-python-packages">Installing the client Python packages</h3>

<p>For the client-side, there are again two separate packages/libraries we can install using <code>pip</code>. One is called <code>frida</code> and the other is called <code>frida-tools</code>. <code>frida</code> allows us to import and use <code>frida</code> in our code while <code>frida-tools</code> provide us with some really useful command-line tools that will help us in the whole reverse engineering process.</p>

<p>Let’s create a new directory and a virtual environment and install both of these packages. We will work on the server part after this.</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir nike_project
$ cd nike_project
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install frida frida-tools
</code></pre>

<p>If everything has been installed and set up correctly, <code>frida-ps -h</code> should output something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ frida-ps -h
Usage: frida-ps [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -D ID, --device=ID    connect to device with the given ID
  -U, --usb             connect to USB device
  -R, --remote          connect to remote frida-server
  -H HOST, --host=HOST  connect to remote frida-server on HOST
  -O FILE, --options-file=FILE
                        text file containing additional command line options
  -a, --applications    list only applications
  -i, --installed       include all installed applications
  -j, --json            output results as JSON
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installing-the-frida-server-on-android">Installing the <code>frida-server</code> on Android</h3>

<p>Now we have to install the frida-server on the Android emulator (you can also use your Android device but I prefer the emulator for testing). At the time of writing this article, the latest release of the frida-server is 12.10.4. You can check the latest version at <a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/">GitHub</a>. Just change the version number in the commands below and they should work:</p>

<pre><code>wget https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/12.10.4/frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
unxz frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64.xz
adb push frida-server-12.10.4-android-x86_64 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server
</code></pre>

<p>The above commands downloaded and copied the frida-server to the emulator, now we need to run the server. Open up adb shell:</p>

<pre><code>adb shell
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the next command within <code>adb shell</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/data/local/tmp/frida-server &amp;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="frida-hooking">Frida hooking</h2>

<p>Once we have the <code>frida-server</code> running, we can start prepping our JavaScript code for injection.</p>

<h3 id="prepping-initial-frida-hook">Prepping initial Frida hook</h3>

<p>I checked out the NRC source, followed the breadcrumbs, and found that the decryption magic was happening in the <code>NativeObfuscator</code> file. I found out the process name of the NRC app by running <code>frida-utils -Ua</code> and then wrote the following Python code for testing my hypothesis:</p>

<pre><code>import frida, sys

jscode = """
Java.perform(function (){
    var MainActivity = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.onboarding.login.WelcomeActivity');
    var ConfFactory = Java.use('com.nike.plusgps.login.UniteConfigFactory');
    var String = Java.use("java.lang.String");
    var obfuscator = Java.use("com.nike.clientconfig.NativeObfuscator");
    var resources = Java.use("android.content.res.Resources");
    var logger = Java.use("com.nike.logger.NopLoggerFactory");
    var strRes = …</code></pre></section></div>

<p>This blog post is part of a series about pair-programming games. To read about more please click see <a href="https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2013/09/what-is-pair-programming/#sessions">more sessions</a> on pair-programming games.</p>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Scenario: You are having an issue and you don’t know how to solve it. You tell someone “Hey, can you help me? Let me tell you my problem!”. You start telling the problem, your conversation partner doesn’t say a word and you say “Yeees, this is it! That’s the solution. Thanks for helping me!”. But you had in fact just a monologue, and you found the solution for yourself.</p>
<p>What if, instead of talking to a human being, you had a constant partner whom you would explain your problems like it were a human being. This is how my teddy bear helps me:</p>
<figure id="attachment_305" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-305"><a href="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner.jpg"><img title="TeddyBearParingPartner" src="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg" alt="Teddy Bear Pair Programming" width="300" height="207" srcset="https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-300x207.jpg 300w, https://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TeddyBearParingPartner-1024x707.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-305">Teddy Bear Pair Programming</figcaption></figure>

<p>This technique is called teddy bear pair programming. My teddy bear helps me when <strong>debugging</strong> some application. I tell him my issues, and I find the answers by myself, he’s that awesome!</p>
<p><em> . . . [an] effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed “Never mind; I see what’s wrong. Sorry to bother you.” This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the teddy bear before they could speak to a human counsellor.</em> (Kernighan, B. W. and R. Pike (1999). The Practice of Programming. Reading, Massachusetts, Addison-Wesley)</p>
<p>When I do <strong>TDD</strong> my teddy bear help me figure out which are the next steps. I talk with him continuously, explaining what I do now, and what are the design choices I make. I need to explain everything to him because he’s so smart that he helps me without saying a word.</p>
<p>When my <strong>IDE</strong> annoys me I tell my teddy bear and I feel a lot better, because he understands me. After all in the teddy bear world they have heavyweight IDE as well.</p>
<p>Your teddy bear will help you with basically anything. You just need to verbalize your problems and ideas. It just makes magic!</p>
<p>I told my colleagues at <a href="http://www.mozaicworks.com/">Mozaic Works</a> about this idea, and as a result the following Open Agile conference they ordered teddy-bears for all the attendees.</p>

<p>Another name for teddy bear paring is the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RubberDucking">Rubber Duckling</a> idea. It’s just that I like teddy bears more than ducks. And teddy bear pair-programming sounds better 🙂</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<h3 id="manipulate-qubit-on-bloch-sphere">Manipulate Qubit on Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

<p>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has become central to software development. To ensure high-quality software releases smoke tests, regression tests, performance tests, static code analysis &amp; security scans are run in CI/CD pipeline. Despite of all these quality measures, still OutOfMemoryError, CPU spikes, unresponsiveness, degradation in response time are surfacing in production environment.</p>



<p>These sort of performance problems surfaces in production because in CI/CD pipeline only macro level metrics such as: Static code quality metrics, test/code coverage, CPU Utilization, memory consumption, response time… are studied. In several cases these macro-metrics aren’t sufficient enough to uncover performance problems. In this article let’s review the micrometrics that should be studied in CI/CD pipeline to deliver high quality releases in production. We will also learn how to source this micrometrics and integrate it into CI/CD pipeline.</p>



<h3>How Tsunamis are forecasted?</h3>



<p>You might wonder why Tsunami forecasting is related to this article. There is a relationship :-). A normal sea wave travels at a speed of 5 – 60 miles/hr, whereas Tsunami waves travel at a speed of 500 – 600 miles/hr. Even though Tsunami wave travels at a speed of 10x – 100x speed of normal waves, it’s very hard to forecast Tsunami waves. Thus, modern day technologies use micrometrics to forecast Tsunami waves.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736" alt="Untitled design (3)" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://tier1app.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/untitled-design-3.png?w=736&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fig: DART Device to detect Tsunami</p>



<p>To forecast Tsunami, <strong><span>multiple DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami) devices are installed all throughout the world. This DART contains two parts:</span></strong></p>



<p>a. Surface Buoy: Device which floats at the top of ocean water<br>
b. Seabed Monitor: Device which is stationed at the bottom of the ocean</p>



<p>Deep ocean water is about 6000 meters in depth. (20x of tallest San Francisco Sales Force tower). Whenever the sea level rises more than 1 mm then DART automatically detects it and transmits this information to satellite. This 1 mm rise in sea water is a lead indicator of Tsunami origination. I would like to request you to pause here for a second and visualize length of 1 mm in the scale of 6000 meters sea depth. It’s nothing, negligible. But this micrometric analysis is what used for forecasting Tsunamis.</p>



<h4><strong>How to forecast Performance Tsunamis through Micrometrics?</strong></h4>



<p>Similarly, there are few micrometrics that you can monitor in your CI/CD pipeline. This micrometrics are lead indicators of several performance problems that you will face in production. Raise or drop in values of these micrometrics are the great indicators for the origination of performance problems.</p>



<p>1. Garbage Collection Throughput<br>
2. Average GC pause time<br>
3. Maximum GC pause time<br>
4. Object creation rate<br>
5. Peak heap size<br>
6. Thread Count<br>
7. Thread States<br>
8. Thread Groups<br>
9. Wasted Memory<br>
10. Object Count<br>
11. Class Count</p>



<p>Let’s study each micrometrics in detail:</p>



<h3>1. GARBAGE COLLECTION THROUGHPUT</h3>



<p>Garbage Collection throughout is the amount of time your application spends in processing customer transactions vs amount of time your application spends in doing garbage collection.</p>



<p>Let’s say your application has been running for 60 minutes. In this 60 minutes, 2 minutes is spent on GC activities.<br>
It means application has spent 3.33% on GC activities (i.e. 2 / 60 * 100)<br>
It means Garbage Collection throughput is 96.67% (i.e. 100 – 3.33).</p>



<p>When there is a degradation in the GC throughput, it’s an indication of some sort of memory problem. Now the question is: What is the acceptable throughput %? It depends on the application and business demands. Typically, one should target for more than 98% throughput.</p>



<h3>2. AVERAGE GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>When Garbage Collection event runs, entire application pauses. Because Garbage Collection has to mark every object in the application, see whether those objects are referenced by other objects, if there is no references then it will have to be evicted from memory. Then fragmented memory has to be compacted. To do all these operations, application will be paused. Thus when Garbage collection runs, customer will experience pauses/delays. Thus one should always target to attain low average GC pause time.</p>



<h3>3. MAX GARBAGE COLLECTION PAUSE TIME</h3>



<p>Some Garbage collection events might take a few milliseconds, whereas some garbage collection events might also take several seconds to minutes. You should measure maximum garbage collection pause time, to understand the worst possible impact to the customer. Proper tuning (and if needed application code changes) are needed to reduce the maximum Garbage Collection pause time.</p>



<h3>4. OBJECT CREATION RATE</h3>



<p>Object creation rate is the average amount of objects created by your application. Maybe in your previous code commit, application was creating 100mb/sec. Starting from recent code commit, application started to create 150mb/sec. This additional object creation rate can trigger lot more GC activity, CPU spikes, potential OutOfMemoryError, memory leaks when application is running for longer period.</p>



<h3>5. PEAK HEAP SIZE</h3>



<p>Peak heap size is the maximum amount of memory consumed by your application. If peak heap size goes beyond a limit you must investigate it. Maybe there is a potential memory leak in the application, newly introduced code (or 3rd libraries/frameworks) is consuming lot of memory, maybe there is legitimate use of it, if it is the case you will have change your JVM arguments to allocate more memory.</p>



<p>“Garbage collection throughput, average GC pause time, maximum GC pause time, object creation rate, peak heap size micrometrics can be sourced only from garbage collection logs. No other tools can be used for this purpose.<br> As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). Garbage Collection logs generated from the test, should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2016/06/18/garbage-collection-log-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>GCeasy’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes garbage collection logs and responds back with above mentioned micrometrics. To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.gceasy.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span> to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed. GCeasy REST API has intelligence to detect various other garbage collection problems such as: memory leaks, user time &gt; sys + real time, sys time &gt; user time, invocation of System.gc() API calls,… Any detected GC problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>6. THREAD COUNT</h3>



<p>Thread count can be another key metric to monitor. If thread count goes beyond a limit it can cause CPU, memory problems. Too many threads can cause ‘java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread’ in the long-running production environment.</p>



<h3>7. THREAD STATES</h3>



<p>Application threads can be in different thread states. To learn about various thread states, refer to this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzYLtYaJ_D0" target="_blank"><span>quick video clip</span></a>. Too many threads in RUNNABLE state can cause CPU spike. Too many threads in BLOCKED state can make application unresponsive. If number of threads in a particular thread state crosses certain threshold then you may consider generating appropriate alerts/warning in CI/CD report.</p>



<h3>8. THREAD GROUPS</h3>



<p>A thread group represents a collection of threads performing similar tasks. There could be a servlet container thread group that processes all the incoming HTTP requests. There could be a JMS thread group, which handles all the JMS sending, receiving activity. There could be some other sensitive thread groups in the application as well. You might want to track those sensitive thread groups size. You don’t want their size neither to drop below a threshold nor go beyond a threshold. Less number of threads in a thread group can stall the activities. More number of threads can lead to memory, CPU problems.</p>



<p>“Thread count, thread states, thread groups micrometrics can be sourced from thread dumps. As part of your CI/CD pipeline, you need to run regression test suite or performance test (ideal). 3 Thread dumps in a gap of 10 seconds interval should be captured when tests are running. Captured thread dumps should be passed to <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2016/10/27/thread-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>FastThread’s REST API</span></a>. This API analyzes thread dumps and responds back with the above mentioned micrometrics.<br> To learn where this micrometrics are sent in the API response and JSON path expression for them, refer <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2018/07/02/key-elements-in-api-response/" target="_blank"><span>to this article</span></a>. If any value is breached, then build can be failed”. FastThread REST API has intelligence to detect several threading problems such as: Deadlocks, CPU spiking threads, prolonged blocking threads, … Any detected problems will be reported in the ‘problem’ element of API response. You might want to track this element as well”.</p>



<h3>9. WASTED MEMORY</h3>



<p>In modern computing world lot of memory is wasted because of poor programming practices such as: duplicate object creation, duplicate string creation, inefficient collections implementations, sub-optimal data type definitions, inefficient finalizations,.. <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.heaphero.io/2018/06/22/heap-dump-analysis-api/" target="_blank"><span>Heap Hero API</span></a> detects an amount of memory wasted due to all these inefficient programming practices. This can be a key metric to track. In case if amount wasted memory goes beyond certain percentage, then CI/CD build can be failed, or warnings can be generated.</p>



<h3>10. OBJECT COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of objects that are present in the application’s memory. Object count can spike up because of inefficient code, new introduction of 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Too many objects can cause OutOfMemoryError, memory leak, CPU spike in production.</p>



<h3>11. CLASS COUNT</h3>



<p>You might also want to track the total number of classes that are present in the application’s memory. Sometimes class count can spike because of an introduction of any 3rd party libraries, frameworks. Spike in classes count, can cause problems in Metaspace/PermGen space of the memory.</p>

<p>The Lyceum Institute provides a digital environment dedicated to fostering the philosophical habit–of questioning the truth of things and the good of life–in all its members, as we collectively pursue the never-ending education of a truly mind-liberating nature. Much of education depends upon the atmosphere in which we immerse ourselves, and, in the twenty-first century, we all inhabit a digital atmosphere. The Lyceum Institute seeks a continual, communal, and thoughtful ennobling of that atmosphere.</p>







<h2>A Better Digital Life</h2>



<p>The Lyceum Institute seeks to aid its members pursuit of better habits, especially of careful thinking, and not just the preservation of truth, but its strengthening. &nbsp;This is not a program, a course, a certification process, nor simply a place to find content for passive consumption, but rather something to become a part of one’s life: a digital medium that directs one towards the development of perfective human habits, rather than deviant ones; habits of humility, generosity, insightful interpretation, willingness to hear, ardor for the truth and deepening one’s understanding, security in forming one’s beliefs, contentment, and worldly detachment.&nbsp; It is an enclave for thinking, differentiated from the world “outside” not by viewing it through a lens of gnosticism, but by instilling and maintaining a dispassionate devotion to the truth.&nbsp; It is where one may go after having observed the chaos, the disorder, the blind ideological adherence, and the sophistical machinations of the wider “intellectual” world, to learn, study, think, and most of all converse with others following a common path.&nbsp; It seeks the improvement of individual understanding through communal effort in fostering philosophical habit.</p>



<p>Digital life allows for unique educational opportunity. For one needs to do more than merely read books or blogs or articles to become educated: education always being a matter of a certain training, which entails not only reading or passive consumption of information, but the interpretative processing of that which is received and—perhaps most importantly of all—a critical conversation with others through which that interpretation may be refined and improved. No mind lives and thrives all on its own, and while reading the works of great writers is an encounter with their minds, it is one-directional only. Something more is needed—other persons, who bring not only their own minds, but all the minds they have read, all the minds they have encountered, in some way to your own.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is open to all-comers: graduate and undergraduate students, professors, clergy, the philosophically-seeking general public, and so on.&nbsp; Experts and novices alike profit from the community of common purpose and the mutual support in the pursuit of bettered habits.&nbsp; It is affordable (costing less per month than most streaming entertainment services); accessible by computer, tablet, or phone, wherever one has an internet connect; and always-improving.</p>



<h2>Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare</h2>



<p>This unique digital environment emerges from the practice of the three parts of the Institute Motto: Inquirere, Ordinare, Memorare — to inquire, to remember, and to order.</p>



<p>Why these three actions?</p>



<p>The Lyceum Institute, being a digital&nbsp;environment, is adapted to fit and fructify the habits enabled by the nature of networked digital technology–which, at its core, is archival.&nbsp; That is, the very nature of digital architecture is to receive and retain bits of information that can represent nearly anything.&nbsp; Anything done online can be archived: captured in an arrangement of data and saved for posterity; it thus extends our memorative&nbsp;habits and capacities.</p>



<p>But consequently, for this archivality to be rightly leveraged, digital technology demands a habit of categorical consideration–a habit of ordering: as any good archive must be well-ordered, and approached with an ordered mind, for it to be used properly.</p>



<p>Furthermore, this demands of us an improved capacity for questioning; that is, no quantity of archived information, no matter how well it is organized, can tell us what we need to know if we do not even know how to ask the right questions.&nbsp; Moreover, what to do with that information requires not simply “the” right question, but a habit of knowing how to formulate those questions and pursue the answers.&nbsp; See <a href="https://cpinsightcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/2020-05-lyceuminstitute_educationdigitallife.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education and Digital Life</a> for more details.</p>



<h2>Memberships</h2>



<p>Enrollment in the Lyceum Institute is sorted into three tiers: Basic, Advanced, and Premium.&nbsp; Please note that there is a $6/mo technology cost for each tier, <em>included</em> in the monthly charge.*</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>Basic Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Advanced Lyceum Enrollment</th><th>Premium Lyceum Enrollment</th></tr><tr><td>Access to the Lyceum Institute</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Persons per account</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Philosophical Resources</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to <i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i></td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Language Studies</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Lecture Recordings</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Access to Seminar Recordings &amp; Advanced Research Archive</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>PDFs of all CPI Publications</td><td></td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Seminar access</td><td></td><td>2 included</td><td>6 included</td></tr><tr><td>Additional seminar discounts</td><td>35% on one<br>

                <p>When aspiring musicians first learn to play their instruments, they rarely start composing their own songs immediately. Most start by learning to play the songs of others. This allows them to focus on skills like intonation, dynamics, and tempo. The skill of composition can wait until they have developed good playing technique.</p>

<p>By contrast, aspiring writers almost always create their own content right from the start. Have you ever heard a conversation like this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œIâ€™m working on a novel.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œCool, whatâ€™s it about?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œItâ€™s Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œOh, you mean like a fanfic?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, Iâ€™m telling the story of Harryâ€™s first year at Hogwarts.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œBut youâ€™re not putting a spin on it or anything?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNope, itâ€™s the same as the story told in the original.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œWord for word?â€�</p>

  <p>â€œNo, but arc for arc. Rowlingâ€™s story, my words.â€�</p>

  <p>â€œHuh. Sort of like a cover.â€�</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish writing covers were considered totally normal. Iâ€™m not talking about adaptations, like Joyceâ€™s <em>Ulysses</em> (an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey</em>, set in 20th century Dublin), although I would love to see more of those too. By â€œcoversâ€�, I mean high-fidelity recreations of other peopleâ€™s written worksâ€”comprehensive paraphrases.</p>

<p>Writing is hard. When youâ€™re learning to write, you have to worry about coherence, organization, and word choice. Thatâ€™s a lot to keep track of. Writing covers is a great way to refine these skills without needing to worry about originality. If writing covers were normal, we could all practice more and improve faster.</p>

<p>There would also be better, and more niche, versions of many written works. Imagine: <em>Jane Eyre</em>, covered by J.K. Rowling. <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, covered by Richard Dawkins. <em>Twilight</em>, covered by Margaret Atwood. Covers like these do exist, but too few. A few months ago I <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1158132219484893184">tweeted</a> about this idea, and Kevin Simler <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/1158136084951261185">boosted</a> it to his 16,000 followers, asking for examples<sup>1</sup>. Here are some good ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hunter S. Thompson covered parts of The Great Gatsby. According to Louis Menandâ€™s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/03/07/believer">obituary of Thompson</a> in <em>The New Yorker</em>, Thompson â€œused to type out pages from <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, just to get the feeling, he said, of what it was like to write that wayâ€�.</li>
  <li>Benjamin Franklin covered articles in the <em>Spectator</em>. He says in his <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page06.htm">autobiography</a>, â€œI took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand.â€�</li>
  <li>Visakan Veerasamy <a href="http://www.visakanv.com/blog/politics-and-the-english-language/">covered</a> George Orwellâ€™s essay, â€œPolitics and the English Languageâ€�. He says in an introductory comment, â€œThe following is my attempt to update George Orwellâ€™s essay <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/">Politics and the English Language (1946)</a> for modern reading. Iâ€™ve tried to follow his own principles to make his words sharper and clearer where I can.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>Look, I get it: we want to be recognized for our own ideas. And when the original source material is just a hyperlink away, why go to the trouble of paraphrasing it? One reason is that it challenges you to internalize the original authorâ€™s way of thinking. It is the deepest possible way to read a text. Another reason is that if you choose texts that are hard to paraphrase, you will stretch yourself to reproduce material that is beyond your current ability to create from scratch. This will expand the range of what you <em>can</em> create from scratch. Lastly, covers are good for readers, too: they provide new vantage points on the underlying ideas. Reading multiple versions of a text is like seeing its underlying ideas with binocular vision.</p>

<p>Covers exist in other domains too: scientists reproduce other scientistsâ€™ experiments; chefs reproduce other chefsâ€™ recipes; painters reproduce other paintersâ€™ paintings. If youâ€™re a writer, why not try your hand at reproducing another writerâ€™s work? Iâ€™ve been doing this for the past few months. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a id="deep-laziness" href="https://davidklaing.com/deep-laziness/">Deep Laziness â€” Sarah Perry</a></li>
  <li><a id="solved-conversations" href="https://davidklaing.com/solved-conversations/">Solved conversations â€” Aaron Z. Lewis</a></li>
  <li><a id="research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process" href="https://davidklaing.com/research-as-a-stochastic-decision-process/">Research as a stochastic decision process â€” Jacob Steinhardt</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s been great exercise for my writing muscles, and I now have enough â€œoriginalâ€�<sup>2</sup> ideas to last me several blog posts. Even if those ideas run dry, I donâ€™t have to worry about writerâ€™s block. If my own ideas arenâ€™t flowing, I can just cover someone elseâ€™s.</p>

<hr>

<p>1. There is another whole category of examples that exist almost by luck: translations. If it werenâ€™t for the fact that many of the greatest works of literature were composed in languages other than our own, we might not get to enjoy them as much as we do. Nobody would be iterating on the language. A few notable examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23198296-beowulf">Beowulf</a>, translated by none other than J.R.R. Tolkien.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39800574-ursula-k-le-guin-yorumuyla-tao-te-ching">The Tao Te Ching</a>, translated by Ursula K. Le Guin, the renowned science fiction writer.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">The Three-Body Problem</a>, translated by Ken Liu. It is <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/wired-book-club-ken-liu-interview/">potentially even better</a> in English than in Liu Cixinâ€™s original Chinese.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068470-the-odyssey">The Odyssey</a>, translated by Emily Wilson. <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/11/best-book-2018.html">Says</a> Tyler Cowen, â€œIt is a joy to read, the best of the five translations I know, and it has received <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=uyf5W6KdI87QrgS54pnQBQ&amp;q=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=emily+wilson+homer+review&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...66238.70838..71982...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz.....0.">strong reviews</a> from scholars for its accuracy and fidelity.â€�</li>
</ul>

<p>2. As Veerasamy pointed out to me when I asked him about his cover of Orwell, even original creations are really just â€œassemblages of micro-coversâ€� anyway. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc">Everything is a Remix</a>.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the COVID crisis, the governor of New Jersey <a href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/As-Unemployment-Claims-Spike-New-Jersey-Seeks-COBOL-Coders.html">called for COBOL developers</a> to help the state fix its unemployment insurance systems. The systems were crashing under overwhelming demand, and the culprit seemed to be the decades-old code underpinning the application for benefits. Predictably, critics jumped all over the government for continuing to operate vital systems using a programming language invented more than 50 years ago.</p>

<p>News flash: the C programming language is the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">most popular language</a> in the world and it’s nearly as old as COBOL. SQL is the backbone of database programming, and it was invented in the 1970s. The age of a technology is no indicator of its viability or appropriateness for solving mission-critical problems. The fact that something is old may just mean that it has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>As it turns out, New Jersey ultimately didn’t hire any COBOL developers because <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cant-file-unemployment-dont-blame-cobol/">the problem wasn’t really COBOL</a>, it was actually something more quotidian and less dramatic: the ability to process forms on the internet in a way that scales. The problem New Jersey and other governments have isn’t that they’re using old code or older programming languages. The problem is often that they’re using <strong>code that wasn’t designed to meet the needs of people who use it.</strong></p>

<p>The frustrated users of New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system shouldn’t necessarily blame the errors they encountered on COBOL. They ought to blame them on a system architecture that wasn’t built to handle increased demand, or on an interface that was copied directly from a PDF instead of being designed based on intensive testing with users. Blame them on systems that can’t talk to each other behind the scenes, so they keep asking people to re-enter their information. Blame them on a complex authentication process for tasks that can be done without requiring someone to create an account or sign in.</p>

<h2 id="getting-good-at-online-forms">Getting good at online forms</h2>

<p>Governments need to see themselves as digital services providers, which means investing in the product, user experience, and research skills necessary to understand the problems of people using their services, and the software engineering and operations skills that make the services reliable and available at the time of someone’s needs. Simply putting out a procurement for a new software project will not guarantee that it’s easy-to-use or able to stand up during a huge increase in demand, without requiring these specific capabilities from the delivery team.</p>

<p>To start, governments need to develop competency at putting forms on the internet and having them scale to meet demand, while integrating smoothly with backend systems and office processes. This skill is at the core of nearly all modern government digital services, yet many agencies continue to operate online forms that are the door to vital services but can’t compete with the user experience and reliability of common consumer apps.</p>

<p>Creating online forms that are easy for the public to fill out and easy for office staff to process is absolutely within reach for every government agency if they’re willing to follow the best practices of consumer technology in designing and operating these services.
At Ad Hoc, we start by bringing in product management and user research experts to work closely with agencies to investigate the main problem to solve and define the outcomes agencies are seeking. We take in all the constraints of government from privacy to security to accessibility, and balance those with the researched needs of real users, informing agency stakeholders of the tradeoffs and empowering them to make effective choices. We conduct usability research with people who come to government websites looking for services to find out where they get stuck, and what could be done to make the experience better.</p>

<p>Our research team also spends time with the civil servants who process incoming requests from the public to see where the bottlenecks are in their process and how we can ensure any new public-facing application integrates with their backend systems. That often means we have to integrate new applications with old systems and “old” code like the COBOL in New Jersey’s unemployment insurance system.</p>

<p>User research, both at the beginning of a project and throughout development, informs how our product managers set “north stars”, or shared visions of a future success, and outcome metrics with the government customer. As our engineers and designers create these new services, they’re always working towards outcomes for real people. We ask, how many people were able to enroll in a benefit? How often did the site go down and deny access to the application? We prioritize outcome-based metrics over how many features we shipped, or how many story points we completed, or whether we’re using the latest technology to get the job done.</p>

<h2 id="choose-whats-right-over-whats-old">Choose what’s right over what’s old</h2>

<p>Yes, agencies should evaluate whether their continued investment in COBOL and mainframes makes sense for them in terms of their unique constraints of available budget and technology resources, just as they should continuously examine any system, regardless of its technology stack or the age of particular components, for whether its delivering the outcomes they want within the constraints they have.</p>

<p>Agencies should also fix the errors of the past and invest in new and more efficient technologies. No civil servant should have to print out forms submitted online and re-enter the information into another system. But we must be precise about what needs updating and why, and not be dismissive of technologies merely because of their age.</p>

<p>The so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>” describes how nearly every computer on the planet is designed and operates. It dates back to the mid-1940s and is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged to this day. We would hardly blame New Jersey’s woes on von Neumann computers, just as we shouldn’t blame forms crashing on COBOL code just because it’s old.</p>

                    <p>I was using Arduino IDE and C++ to program my IOT devices built around ESP-12E. But, I was in need of a higher level language to easily manage my HTTP requests from the device as a client; or, create a small web server in the device itself. I found that using Arduino C++ was a bit hard to deal with that. I liked the idea of using Python in ESP8266 so decided to install MicroPython firmware on ESP8266 E-12.</p>
<p>I am using Python 3.7 but Python 2.7 should also work (according to documentation in MicroPython but I haven't tested it)</p>
<p>For the Hello World application we will not to build any electronic circuit as we're using built-in LED. But I assume your ESP-12E is soldered and connected to an FTDI interface.</p>

<h3 id="installingsteps">Installing steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Install Python if not already installed</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install pip3</strong> (or pip if you're on Python 2.7)<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install esptool</strong><br>
pip3 install esptool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Download MicroPython firmware</strong><br>
<a href="http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin">http://micropython.org/resources/firmware/esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Erase flash in your ESP8266</strong> (Update your PORT accordingly)<br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 erase_flash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flash new firmware</strong><br>
esptool.py --port PORT3 --baud 115200 write_flash -fm dio 0x00000 esp8266-20180511-v1.9.4.bin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If step above doesn't work try changing baud rate</strong> (to 57600 or something else)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Install ampy</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/ampy" target="_blank">Check their website</a>)<br>
pip3 install adafruit-ampy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upload the blink example using ampy</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Name below file as "main.py"</p>
<pre><code>import machine
import time
led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)
led.off()
time.sleep(1)
led.on()
time.sleep(1)
led.off()

led.on()
time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>and upload using ampy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy -d 1 --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 -b 115200 ls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Above code will use the built-in LED on the ESP-12 so we don't need to connect any resistors or LEDs.</p>

        # which will show up after the soft reboot and before the raw REPL.
        # Modification from original pyboard.py below:
        #   Add a small delay and send Ctrl-C twice after soft reboot to ensure
        #   any main program loop in main.py is interrupted.
        time.sleep(0.5)

            raise PyboardError('could not enter raw repl')
</code></pre>
<p>After this change I was able to run the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 ls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I can upload the file that I have written in step 9. Let's name this file as "main.py" and upload to ESP8266</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ampy --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 put main.py</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to execute Python commands while connected to ESP8266 as if you were typing commands in IDLE, you can easily setup a serial connection with ESP8266.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>screen /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 115200</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cuneyt.aliustaoglu.biz/en/content/images/2018/08/screen.gif" alt="screen"></p>
<p>Now that we managed to install our first ever Python application for ESP8266 we're ready to build much more complicated application with the power of Python.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>7th January 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest in my series of minimalist watches using 12 LEDs, arranged like a clock face, to show the time analogue-style. This one takes advantage of the fact that Microchip's new 1-series ATtiny microcontrollers incorporate a real-time clock, which can be run from an external crystal to keep accurate time while the main processor is put to sleep:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatimewatch.jpg" alt="MegaTimeWatch.jpg" width="500" height="432"></p>
<p><em>The Mega Tiny Time watch based on an ATtiny414; it's ten to two.</em></p>
<p>To show the time you press the button on the watch face, and it lights up LEDs to show the time like the hour and minute hands on a clock. The LEDs flash to distinguish the hours and minutes, and show intermediate times. The watch keeps time to within a few seconds a month, while giving a battery life of several years.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?1MG3">Tiny Time 2 Watch</a>&nbsp;used Maxim Integrated's DS2417 RTC chip to keep time while the processor was put to sleep, to save power. Since I designed that, Microchip have released their 1-series ATtiny chips that incorporate a crystal-controlled real-time clock; this can keep time while the processor is asleep, avoiding the need for a separate RTC chip. Spence Konde calls these the "Mega Tiny" range; hence the name of this watch.</p>
<p>I based this watch on the 14-pin ATtiny414, which has 4K bytes of flash memory, and has an RTC peripheral that supports an external crystal. In this design there are a few I/O pins spare, so you could extend the watch with other features; see <a href="#further-suggestions">Further suggestions</a> below.</p>
<p>As with my earlier watch, to show the time you press the button on the watch face, and the time is then displayed for five seconds. It lights one LED to show the hour, and flashes one or two other LEDs to show the minutes to the nearest minute by altering the rate at which each of the LEDs flash. Here are some examples:</p>

<p><em>Examples of how the Mega Tiny Time watch displays the time.</em></p>
<p>For consistency with analogue watches, the Tiny Time Watch displays times later than half past the hour by lighting the next hour number. If only one LED lights up you know that both hands are pointing to the same hour mark.</p>
<p>The total power consumption with no display is just 1µA, giving an estimated battery life of over 10 years from a single CR2016 battery! Obviously this is reduced if you check the time frequently.</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the circuit of the Tiny Time 2 watch, laid out like the circuit board:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watchtinymega.gif" alt="WatchTinyMega.gif" width="642" height="547"></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the ATtiny414-based Mega Tiny Time watch.</em></p>
<p>The crystal is a standard&nbsp;32.768 kHz quartz watch crystal; I chose a MS1V-T1K micro crystal&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but I expect any&nbsp;32.768 kHz&nbsp;crystal would be suitable. A 3.2 X 1.5 mm SMD crystal would also fit across the pads on the PCB.</p>
<p>The LEDs are 0805 size, and for this version of the watch I chose white LEDs to contrast with the black circuit board. I got mine from Bright Components in the UK, who sell them for under £1 for ten&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>. Any colour LED should be fine, but they should all be the same colour.</p>
<p>I arranged the LEDs to simplify the PCB layout which explains the rather haphazard order, but this is easily accommodated by an array in the software. The following table shows which LED lights up when you take one I/O line high and the other I/O line low:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/watch3leds.gif" alt="Watch3LEDs.gif" width="243" height="167"></p>
<p>The button is a miniature SMD push button available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, available from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The battery is a 20mm coin cell. Given the low current consumption I decided to use the slimmer CR2016 cell, and found a suitable SMD battery holder on Mouser <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. Alternatively you could use a CR2032 battery, with an SMD 20mm coin cell holder available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>, or from Proto-PIC in the UK <sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If a child could play with this watch please bend the tabs on the coin cell holder, or glue in the coin cell, so the cell can't be removed and swallowed.</p>
<h4>â–º Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed the board in Eagle and sent it to PCBWay for fabrication.&nbsp;Here's the layout (from the OSH Park preview):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimewatchpcb.gif" alt="MegaTinyTimeWatchPCB.gif" width="441" height="250"></p>
<p>See the end of the article for links to download the board files or order a board.</p>
<p>I built the watch using SMD components, with all the components apart from the battery holder soldered to the front of the board. The ATtiny414 was SOIC, and I used 0805 resistors and LEDs, so they should be relatively easy to solder by hand:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimefront.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeFront.jpg" width="290" height="330"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/megatinytimeback.jpg" alt="MegaTinyTimeBack.jpg" width="290" height="330"></p>
<p><em>The front and back of the completed Mega Tiny Time watch circuit board.</em></p>
<p>The LEDs should all be soldered with the same orientation, with the negative sides facing the centre of the board.</p>
<p>I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun at 250°C to solder the SMD components onto the front of the board, and then finally soldered the battery holder onto the back of the board using a conventional soldering iron. If you don't have a hot air gun you should be able to solder the SMD components with a bit of care using a fine-tipped soldering iron.</p>
<p>I found a suitable 12mm wide thread-through watch strap from a German supplier <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>This section explains the various sections of the Tiny Time Watch program.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Clock</h4>
<p>As in my earlier project&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2RA3">New ATtiny Low Power</a>, the aim is to keep the processor asleep most of the time to minimise the watch's power consumption.</p>
<p>From the ATtiny414 datasheet I realised that there were two possible ways to use the 1-series ATtiny Real-Time Clock peripheral in this application. It could run as a Real-Time Counter, keeping a 16-bit count of the number of elapsed seconds in the RTC CNT Count register while the processor stays asleep. Alternatively it could run as a Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT), generating an interrupt to wake up the processor briefly every second and increment a variable to count the number of seconds.</p>
<p>In theory the CNT approach should give slightly lower power consumption, because the processor only needs to be woken up when you're displaying the time, but I couldn't get it to work; the CNT register didn't seem to get incremented when the processor was asleep. However, the PIT approach worked perfectly, and the difference in power consumption is probably minimal. If I get the CNT method working I'll post it as an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up the RTC to use an external crystal is more complicated than you might expect, because the Clock Controller is protected from accidental change by Configuration Change Protection (CCP), so before each change you have to enable the action first. Fortunately there's an application note that explains how to do this, and my code is based on one of the examples in that note <sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>The display</h4>
<p>The 12 LEDs are driven by the four I/O lines PA1, PA4, PPA5, and PA6. The array Pin[6][6] specifies how the LEDs are connected to the five I/O lines:</p>
<pre>int Pins[6][6] = {{ -1, -1, -1,  8,  6,  4 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  { -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 },
                  {  7, -1, -1, -1, 11,  9 },
                  {  0, -1, -1, 10, -1,  2 },
                  {  5, -1, -1,  3,  1, -1 }};</pre>
<p>The first row of the array specifies which LEDs have their cathodes connected to PA1: the LED at 8 o'clock has its anode connected to PA4, the LED at 6 o'clock has its anode connected to PA5, and the LED at 4 o'clock has its anode connected to PA6. The values in the array corresponding to PA2 and PA3 are set to -1, as these aren't connected to any LEDs; it was simpler to use a larger array than write code to compensate for this.</p>
<p>I used Timer/Counter TCB running at 250 Hz to multiplex the display. This is set up by the routine <strong>DisplaySetup()</strong> as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplaySetup () {
  // Set up Timer/Counter TCB to multiplex the display
  TCB0.CCMP = 19999;                                  // Divide 5MHz by 20000 = 250Hz
  TCB0.CTRLA = TCB_CLKSEL_CLKDIV1_gc | TCB_ENABLE_bm; // Enable timer, divide by 1
  TCB0.CTRLB = 0;                                     // Periodic Interrupt Mode
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}</pre>
<p>The interrupt service routine simply calls <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong>, decrements the global variable <strong>Timeout,</strong> and increments the global variable <strong>Offset</strong> used when initially setting the time:</p>
<pre>ISR(TCB0_INT_vect) {
  TCB0.INTFLAGS = TCB_CAPT_bm;                        // Clear the interrupt flag
  DisplayNextRow();
  Timeout--;
  Offset++;
}</pre>
<p>Two additional routines are used to turn the display on and off:</p>
<pre>void DisplayOn () {
  // Turn off all the pullups
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = 0;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = 0;
  TCB0.INTCTRL = TCB_CAPT_bm;                         // Enable interrupt
}

void DisplayOff () {
  TCB0.INTCTRL = 0;                                   // Disable interrupt
  PORTA.DIR = 0;                                      // All PORTA pins inputs
  // Turn on all the pullups for minimal power in sleep
  PORTA.PIN0CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;                  // UPDI
  PORTA.PIN1CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN4CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN5CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
  PORTA.PIN6CTRL = PORT_PULLUPEN_bm;
}</pre>
<h4>Display multiplexing</h4>
<p>The routine <strong>DisplayNextRow()</strong> works as follows:</p>
<pre>void DisplayNextRow() {
  Cycle++;
  uint8_t row = Cycle &amp; 0x03;
  if (row &gt; 0) row = row + 2;                         // Skip PA2 and PA3
  uint8_t bits = 0;
  for (int i=0; i&lt;6; i++) {
    if (Hours == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
    if (Fivemins == Pins[row][i]) bits = bits | 1&lt;&lt;(i+1);
  }
  PORTA.DIR = 1&lt;&lt;(row+1) | bits;                      // Make outputs for lit LED
  PORTA.OUT = bits;                                   // Set outputs high
}
</pre>

<p>Up to two LEDs can be lit at once. The LED specified by the variable <strong>Hours</strong> is used to show the hours, and is displayed continuously. The LED specified by the variable&nbsp;<strong>Fivemins</strong>&nbsp;is used for the minutes.</p>
<p>The bottom two bits of the variable <strong>Cycle</strong> determine which row is being displayed. For a given row the array <strong>Pins[row][i]</strong> is checked to see if any of the LEDs in that row need to be displayed. If so, the appropriate bits are set in the variable <strong>bits</strong>. This is then written to the port.</p>
<p>To test the the LEDs you can run the following&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong> function instead of …</p></div></div>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on July 09, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Plus-Minus"
problem in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force
solution</a> using the
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html">itertools</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html">operator</a> modules.</li>
<li>How to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden structure within
the problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">positive number</a>
<var>n</var>.
Your goal is to find a way to add and subtract the numbers
from 1 to <var>n</var> to make 0.</p>
<p>E.g. <var>n</var> = 4 and a solution is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0 = 1 - 2 - 3 + 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a given <var>n</var> it may be impossible to find a
solution.</p>

<p>I represent the solution as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">list</a> of the numbers 1 to
<var>n</var>, each number being positive or negative (to represent addition or
subtraction).
E.g. the solution "1 - 2 - 3 + 4" is represented as</p>
<pre><code>[1, -2, -3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>If a solution cannot be found, I use the value
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a>.</p>

<p>A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> will attempt every
possible way to add and subtract the numbers.
Here's a Python function that does that:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_bf(*, n):
    """Solve the 'Plus Minus' problem using brute force."""
    assert n &gt; 0
    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    for signs in product([pos, neg], repeat=n):
        signed_nums = [
            sign(num)
            for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
        ]
        if sum(signed_nums) == 0:
            return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code starts with a range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness">unsigned
numbers</a> and "signs" the numbers by
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.pos">operator.pos</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.neg">operator.neg</a>.
The code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product">itertools.product</a>
to generate all possible ways to mark the numbers in <code>unsigned_nums</code> as
positive (being added) or negative (being subtracted).
Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_bf(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [1, 2, -3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [1, 2, -3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, 2, 3, 4, -5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of
this function?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 2<sup><var>n</var></sup> ways to add and
subtract the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>Signing the unsigned numbers and checking that the signed
numbers sum to 0 takes O(<var>n</var>) operations, because
the list of <var>n</var> numbers is looped over.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the function is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var> 2<sup><var>n</var></sup>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To create a more efficient solution, I look more closely at
the structure of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have the numbers 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider any 4 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence">consecutive</a> numbers</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>i</var>, <var>i</var>+1, <var>i</var>+2,
<var>i</var>+3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's true that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<var>i</var>) - (<var>i</var>+1) - (<var>i</var>+2) +
(<var>i</var>+3) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I call this <strong>the pattern.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I can solve the problem if
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</li>
<li>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I can solve the problem if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-1 - 2 + 3 ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This totals to 0.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat <strong>the pattern</strong> <var>k</var> times to cover all the
numbers from 1 to <var>n</var>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The additions and subtractions will total to 0.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But, what if <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2?
There is no solution.
Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For a given <var>n</var>, I want to divide the numbers 1
to <var>n</var> into two
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)">sets</a>, the pluses
<var>P</var> and the minuses <var>M</var>, so that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) - sum(<var>M</var>) = 0</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 2
sum(<var>M</var>)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>The numbers 1 to <var>n</var> are divided between
<var>P</var> and <var>M</var>, so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) = 1 + 2 + ... +
<var>n</var></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This sum is called the <var>n</var>-th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular
number</a> and has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression">closed
form expression</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + 2 + ... + <var>n</var> = <var>n</var>(<var>n</var> +
1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) =
<var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(<var>P</var>) + sum(<var>M</var>) is even</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be even</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1)/2 must be divisible by 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that</p>

<p><var>n</var>(<var>n</var> + 1) must be divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> or <var>n</var> + 1 is divisible by 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is only true when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 3</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that there is no solution when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or when</p>
<blockquote>
<p><var>n</var> = 4<var>k</var> + 2</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a Python function that implements this faster
algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import cycle, chain
from operator import pos, neg


def plus_minus_fast(*, n):
    """Efficiently solve the 'Plus Minus' problem."""
    assert n &gt; 0

    rem = n % 4
    if rem == 1 or rem == 2:
        return None

    pattern = [pos, neg, neg, pos]
    if rem == 0:
        signs = cycle(pattern)
    elif rem == 3:
        signs = chain([neg, neg, pos], cycle(pattern))

    unsigned_nums = range(1, n + 1)
    signed_nums = [
        sign(num) for sign, num in zip(signs, unsigned_nums)
    ]
    return signed_nums
</code></pre>
<p>This code uses
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle">itertools.cycle</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain">itertools.chain</a>
to construct the sequence of signs.
<code>cycle()</code> actually creates an infinite <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator">iterator</a>, but this
isn't a problem because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip">zip</a> truncates the iterator to
the length of <code>unsigned_nums</code>.</p>
<p>Here are solutions for <var>n</var> = 1 to <var>n</var> = 10.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>print("n   Solution")
print("--  --------")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i:2}  {plus_minus_fast(n=i)}")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>n   Solution
--  --------
 1  None
 2  None
 3  [-1, -2, 3]
 4  [1, -2, -3, 4]
 5  None
 6  None
 7  [-1, -2, 3, 4, -5, -6, 7]
 8  [1, -2, -3, 4, 5, -6, -7, 8]
 9  None
10  None
</code></pre>
<p>What's the time complexity of this algorithm?
For a positive integer <var>n</var>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+1 or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+2, then the function
immediately returns, taking O(1) steps.</li>
<li>Otherwise, <var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var> or
<var>n</var>Â&nbsp;=Â&nbsp;4<var>k</var>+3.
<ul>
<li>Creating the iterator <code>signs</code> takes O(1) steps.</li>
<li>Iterating over <code>signs</code> and <code>unsigned_nums</code> takes O(<var>n</var>)
steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to solve the "Plus-Minus" problem.
You learned how to create a brute force solution using the itertools and
operator modules.
And you learned how to create a more efficient solution by noticing hidden
structure in the problem.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are given positive numbers <var>n</var> and <var>m</var>.
Write a program that finds a way to add and subtract the numbers from 1 to
<var>n</var> to make <var>m</var>.</p>

				<p>This is a short guide describing the latency implications of the virtual memory
abstraction. If you are building systems requiring low and predictable latency
such as realtime audio processing, control and high frequency trading (HFT) /
algorithmic trading systems this guide will be useful to you. It is written from
the perspective Linux kernel running on AMD64 / x86-64 architecture, but the
general concepts applies to most operating systems and CPU architectures.</p>
<p>In summary to minimize latency introduced by the virtual memory abstraction you
should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize page faults by pre-faulting, locking and pre-allocating needed
memory. Disable swap.</li>
<li>Reduce TLB misses by minimizing your working set memory and utilizing huge
pages.</li>
<li>Prevent TLB shootdowns by not modifying your programs page tables after
startup.</li>
<li>Prevent stalls due to page cache writeback by not creating file backed
writable memory mappings.</li>
<li>Disable Linux transparent huge pages (THP) background defragmentation.</li>
<li>Disable Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM).</li>
<li>Disable Linux automatic NUMA balancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="page-faults">Page faults</h2>
<p>When reading or writing to file backed memory that is not in the <em>page
cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> or to <em>anonymous memory</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that has been swapped out,
the kernel must first load the data from the underlying storage device. This is
called a major page fault and incurs a similar overhead as issuing a <code>read</code> or
<code>write</code> system call.</p>
<p>If the page is already in the page cache you will still incur a minor page fault
on first access after calling <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>, during which the page table is
updated to point to the correct page<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. For anonymous memory there
will also be a minor page fault on first write access, when a anonymous page is
allocated, zeroed and the page table updated<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Basically memory mappings
are lazily initialized on first use. Note also that access to the page table
during a page fault is protected by locks leading to scalability issues in
multi-threaded applications<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To avoid page faults you can pre-fault and disable page cache eviction of the
needed memory using the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html"><code>mlock</code></a> system call or the <code>MAP_LOCKED</code> and
<code>MAP_POPULATE</code> flags to <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html"><code>mmap</code></a>. You can also disable swap system wide to
prevent anonymous memory from being swapped to disk.</p>
<p>You can monitor number of page faults using</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">ps -eo min_flt,maj_flt,cmd
</code></pre><p>or</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e faults,minor-faults,major-faults
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-misses">TLB misses</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer">translation lookaside buffer (TLB)</a>
is a on CPU cache that maps virtual to physical addresses. These mappings are
maintained for pages typically of size 4 KiB, 2/4 MiB or 1 GiB. Usually there
are separate TLBs for data (DTLB) and instructions (ITLB) with a shared second
level TLB (STLB)<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The TLB has a limited number of entries and if a
address is not found in the TLB or STLB, the page table data in the CPU caches
or main memory needs to be referenced, this is called a TLB miss<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. The
same as a CPU cache miss is more expensive than a cache hit, a TLB miss is more
expensive than a TLB hit.</p>
<p>You can minimize TLB misses by reducing your working set size, making sure to
pack your data into as few pages as possible. Additionally you can utilize
larger page sizes than the default 4 KiB. These larger pages are called <em>huge
pages</em><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> and allows you to reference more data using fewer pages.</p>
<p>TLB usage can be monitored using:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">perf stat -e dTLB-loads,dTLB-load-misses,iTLB-loads,iTLB-load-misses
</code></pre><h2 id="tlb-shootdowns">TLB shootdowns</h2>
<p>Most processors do not provide coherence guarantees for TLB mappings. Instead
the kernel provides this guarantee using a mechanism called <em>TLB shootdown</em>. It
operates by sending inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) that runs kernel code to
invalidate the stale TLB entries<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. <em>TLB shootdowns</em> causes each affected
core to context switch into the kernel and thus causes latency spikes for the
process running on the affected cores. It will also cause TLB misses when a
address with an invalidated page table entry is subsequently accessed.</p>
<p>Any operation that narrows a process’ access to memory like <code>munmap</code> and
<code>mprotect</code> will cause a TLB shootdown. Calls to the C standard library allocator
(<code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, etc) will call <code>madvise(...MADV_FREE)</code>/<code>munmap</code> internally,
but not necessarily on each invocation. TLB shootdowns will also occur during
page cache writeback.</p>
<p>To avoid TLB shootdowns you can map all needed memory at program startup and
avoid calling any functions that modifies the page table after that. The
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc">mimalloc allocator</a> can be tuned to
allocate huge pages at program startup (<code>MIMALLOC_RESERVE_HUGE_OS_PAGES=N</code>) and
never return memory to the OS (<code>MIMALLOC_PAGE_RESET=0</code>).</p>
<p>You can monitor the number of TLB shootdowns in <code>/proc/interrupts</code>.</p>
<h2 id="page-cache-writeback">Page cache writeback</h2>
<p>When a page in the <em>page cache</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has been modified it is marked as
dirty and needs to be eventually written back to disk. This process is called
writeback and is triggered automatically on a timer or when specifically
requested using the system calls <code>fsync</code>, <code>fdatasync</code>, <code>sync</code>, <code>syncfs</code>,
<code>msync</code>, and others. If any of the dirty pages are part of a writable memory
mapping, the writeback process must first update the page table to mark the page
as read-only before writing it to disk. Any subsequent memory write to the page
will cause a page fault, letting the kernel update the page cache state to dirty
and mark the page writable again. In practice this means that writeback causes
TLB shootdowns and that writes to pages that are currently being written to disk
must stall until the disk write is complete. This leads to latency spikes for
any process that is using <em>file backed writable memory mappings</em>.</p>
<p>To avoid latency spikes due to <em>page cache writeback</em> you cannot create any file
backed writable memory mappings. Creating anonymous writable memory mappings
using <code>mmap(...MAP_ANONYMOUS)</code> or by mapping files on
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/tmpfs.html">Linux <em>tmpfs</em> filesystem</a>
is fine.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://rigtorp.se/writeback.cpp">small program to demonstrate this effect</a>. On my
Ryzen 3900X with Samsung 970 EVO NVME SSD running Linux 5.7 I get latency spikes
of hundreds of microseconds due to writeback activity:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># ./writeback 9 $HOME/junkfile.bin

jitter     661983 ns

</code></pre><h2 id="transparent-hugepages">Transparent hugepages</h2>
<p>On
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html">Linux <em>transparent huge page</em> (THP) support</a>
should cause TLB shootdowns when memory regions are compacted / defragmented,
but I have not verified that.</p>
<p>THP can be beneficial for reducing TLB misses, but you should disable
<em>khugepaged</em> background defragmentation to avoid any latency spikes due to the
defragmentation process:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">echo 0 &gt;/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/defrag
</code></pre><p>There is some ongoing work to support THP for file backed memory:

<h2 id="kernel-samepage-merging">Kernel samepage merging</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html">Linux kernel samepage merging (KSM)</a>
is a feature that can de-duplicate pages with identical data. The merging
process will lead to TLB shootdowns and unpredictable memory access latencies.</p>
<p>Make sure kernel samepage merging (KSM) is disabled.</p>
<h2 id="numa-and-page-migration">NUMA and Page migration</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/vm/numa.html">Non-uniform memory access (NUMA)</a> occurs when the memory access time
varies with memory location and processor core. You need to take this into
account when designing your system.</p>
<p>On Linux you can use <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cpusets.html">cpusets</a>, <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/numactl.8.html"><code>numactl</code></a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/set_mempolicy.2.html"><code>set_mempolicy</code></a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html"><code>mbind</code></a> to control the NUMA node
memory placement policy.</p>
<p>Additionally Linux supports

The automatic NUMA balancing will cause page faults and TLB shootdowns and
should be disabled:</p>

<p>“The physical memory is volatile and the common case for getting data into
the memory is to read it from files. Whenever a file is read, the data is
put into the page cache to avoid expensive disk access on the subsequent
reads. Similarly, when one writes to a file, the data is placed in the page
cache and eventually gets into the backing storage device. The written pages
are marked as dirty and when Linux decides to reuse them for other purposes,
it makes sure to synchronize the file contents on the device with the

    <h2>Product Description</h2>
<p>The CDATA OLTs are OEM FTTH OLTs, sold under different brands (Cdata, OptiLink, BLIY), allowing to provide FTTH connectivity to a large number of clients (using ONTs).
Some of the devices support multiple 10-gigabit uplinks and provide Internet connectivity to up to 1024 ONTs (clients).</p>
<p>We validated the vulnerabilities against FD1104B and FD1108SN OLTs in our lab environment with the latest firmware versions (V1.2.2 and 2.4.05_000, 2.4.04_001 and 2.4.03_000).
<img alt="" src="https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/images/2020-olt.jpg"></p>
<p>Using static analysis, these vulnerabilities also appear to affect all available OLT models as the codebase is similar:</p>

<h2>Details - Backdoor Access with telnet</h2>
<p>A telnet server is running in the appliance and is reachable from the WAN interface and from the FTTH LAN interface (from the ONTs).</p>
<p>Depending on the firmware, the backdoor credentials may change. You can find below a complete list of backdoor (undocumented) credentials, giving an attacker a complete administrator CLI access.</p>
<p>Previous and old versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: suma123
password: panger123
</code></pre>
<p>New recent versions can be abused with:</p>
<pre><code>login: debug

<p><em>Sometimes you’re bored on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of data visualization on a Friday night. Sometimes you think of (or, better yet, eat) dumplings on a Friday night.</em> <em>And sometimes, you do all of the above.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="dumplings">

<p>I am a fan of dumplings. Bread-type foods are awesome. Filled foods are awesome. Filled bread is awesome (if you’ve never had a Georgian <em>lobiani</em>, you’re missing out!). A dumpling, though not necessarily having to be filled, combines a lot of this. In <em>my</em> world, a dumpling is normally cooked in some liquid though – that is, boiled, simmered, steamed, or deep-fried, rather than, say, baked. We’ll come back to this.</p>
<p>I work as a researcher in linguistics, and I’m interested in comparing different languages. How are they similar and how are they different? Sometimes, I use multidimensional scaling (MDS) as a way of comparing such similarities or differences. Anyway, on this particular Friday night (August 23rd, 2019), I saw a <a href="https://twitter.com/Laserhedvig/status/1164794499324772354">Twitter post</a> mentioning a “dumpling party” (omg, that in itself = love), at which one person had brought Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arancini"><em>arancini</em></a>, which received “mixed reception” by the other guests. So I started thinking, <em>what defines a “dumpling”, and can you group them based on various features</em>. Turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/emilymbender">Emily Bender et al.</a> had already established a definition of <em>dumpling</em> at their website promoting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/idop-idod/idod"><em>International Day of Dumplings</em></a> – I did not know of this as of this particular Friday night.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought <em>what if I just look up some dumplings on Wikipedia, and code some of the specific features for each one?</em> This could allow me to plot them in two-dimensional space using MDS methods. I was intrigued by the possible outcome, so I started reading through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Wikipedia article “Dumpling”</a>…</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling">

<p>My method wasn’t very sophisticated. I started by scrolling through the Wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling">Dumpling</a>, and basically took each item that had its own article (I may have missed a few), transferred it to a spreadsheet, and started adding some columns for particular features. As I started getting more items, the number of features grew, and I have to be honest, they are far from perfect and just things that I thought of on the spot. A <em>much better</em> analysis could easily be done with a bit more sophistication, time, and systematicity. I mean, this was after all just a random Friday night and I was already past my bed time…</p>
<p>In the end, I collected data from 61 different dumplings. Note that when I say different, this categorization is not at all well-defined. I tried to exclude duplicates for which even the names themselves were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate"><em>cognates</em></a>. Chinese <em>jiǎozi (餃子)</em> is related to Japanese <em>gyōza (ギョーザ)</em> and thus only the former was included. However, in the case of German <em>Knödel</em> and Czech <em>knedlík</em>, I decided to include both simply based on the fact that whereas the former was listed as potentially being served with a sweet filling, I did not observe this with the latter – NB: I promise this wasn’t a biased decision (see the <a href="#bonus">Bonus</a> section).</p>
<p>Beyond the dumplings sampled according to the above criteria, I also included a few items not traditionally seen as dumplings, because I wanted to see how they patterned with the dumplings proper. These items include <em>calzone</em>, <em>bitterballen</em>, and – of course – <em>arancini</em>. The resulting sample of 61 items can be seen below.</p>

<p>The features that I ended up settling on amounted to 15 different ones. Some are related but not mutually exclusive. The concern mainly content, form, and preparation. Some dumplings can be prepared in several ways (e.g., either <em>boiled</em> or <em>steamed</em>) and may be either <em>sweet</em> or <em>savory</em>; others seem to be more strict with regard to some of these features.</p>

<h3>Dumpling features</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flour</strong>: <em>Is flour (any type) used in the dough?</em></li>
<li><strong>Bread</strong>: <em>Are bread bits or breadcrumbs added?</em></li>
<li><strong>Battered</strong>: <em>Is the dough battered (or itself a batter) before prepared?</em></li>
<li><strong>Starch</strong>: <em>Is any starchy produce added to the dough (e.g., potatoes)</em></li>
<li><strong>Plain</strong>: <em>Does it occur without filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Filled</strong>: <em>Does it occur with filling?</em></li>
<li><strong>Thick</strong>: <em>Is the doughy coating “thick” (yes, this is quite subjective)</em></li>
<li><strong>Boiled</strong>: <em>Can it be boiled?</em></li>
<li><strong>Steamed</strong>: <em>Can it be steamed?</em></li>
<li><strong>DeepFried</strong>: <em>Can it be deep-fried?</em></li>
<li><strong>Fried</strong>: <em>Can it be fried (e.g., in a pan or a grill)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Baked</strong>: <em>Can it be baked (e.g., in an oven)?</em></li>
<li><strong>Raw</strong>: <em>Can it be served basically as is?</em></li>
<li><strong>Sweet</strong>: <em>Is it sweet?</em></li>
<li><strong>Savory</strong>: <em>Is it savory?</em></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each dumpling was assigned a binary value (0 or 1) per feature, resulting in the below table – again, not that this was not very serious work on a Friday night and I was tired; errors are to be expected (but feel free to re-work this yourself if you feel like it!).</p>
