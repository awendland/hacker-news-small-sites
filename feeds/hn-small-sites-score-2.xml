<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>As discussed in the <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/an-accountants-guide-to-order-to-cash/">first post</a> in this series, Order to Cash describes the procedure for processing customer orders, applying payments to invoices, and matching payments to the cash received in a company’s bank account.</p>
<p>In this process, cash flows through a number of systems described in detail below.</p>
<p>Accountants perform cash reconciliations to ensure that cash has appropriately gone through these systems for each transaction.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatisaaidcashreconciliationcashreconciliationa">What Is a <a id="cashreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation</a>?</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>A cash reconciliation is the process of verifying the completeness of a sale or transaction across the company’s financial systems. Its completion provides assurance for both cash and revenue balances.</p>
<p>Multiple financial systems are involved in a cash reconciliation and generally, cash balances across these systems do not match.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/cash-reconciliation-example.png" alt="cash-reconciliation-example"></p>
<p>We’ll explore cash reconciliations further below, but first we’d like to address a common misconception.</p>
<h5 id="cashreconciliationvsbankreconciliation">Cash Reconciliation vs. Bank Reconciliation</h5>
<p>Cash reconciliations are often misunderstood to be the same thing as bank reconciliations.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.accountingcoach.com/bank-reconciliation/explanation">bank reconciliation</a> is the process of matching transaction amounts reported in a bank statement with those recorded in the general ledger. Its purpose is to ensure that the cash balance recorded in the general ledger aligns with the entity’s actual cash balance in the company’s bank account. While companies and banks record the same transactions, the time at which a company records cash in the general ledger often differs from the time at which their bank reports the associated change.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="systemsinvolvedinacashreconciliation">Systems Involved in a Cash Reconciliation</h2>
<p>A cash reconciliation is more complex and comprehensive than a bank reconciliation because it involves a company's entire financial technology stack. Below are the four most common systems involved in a cash reconciliation. They can vary depending on company size, business model, or technological maturity.</p>
<h5 id="billingsystem">Billing System:</h5>
<p>A billing system creates and manages customer invoices that allow customers to pay for their purchases. Cash from billing systems represent how much cash is expected to be collected from sales.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Aria, Chargebee, Recurly</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="paymentprocessor">Payment Processor:</h5>
<p>A payment processor relays customers’ payment information to a company’s bank and the customers’ banks in order to complete a transaction. It verifies payment legitimacy and provides instructions to banks for fund transfers. Cash from payment processors represent the final cash received by the company’s bank.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Stripe, Adyen, Braintree/PayPal, WorldPay</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="companysbank">Company’s Bank:</h5>
<p>A company’s bank collects and deposits the cash from transactions that are successfully processed by payment processors. It is the final system involved in a cash reconciliation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="revenuerecognitionsystem">Revenue Recognition System:</h5>
<p>A revenue recognition system calculates revenue for the current period and liabilities for future deferred revenues. It ingests information from both billing systems and payment processors to perform these calculations according to the company’s arrangements and policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Leapfin, NetSuite ARM, Zuora RevPro</li>
</ul>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Generally, the cash balances across these systems <em>do not match</em>, which is precisely why accounting teams need to perform cash reconciliations.</p>
<p>Common reasons for mismatch across these financial systems include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Currency differences (Transaction currency, local exchange currency, payout currency)</li>
<li>Foreign exchange translations (How an international company translates foreign subsidiary earnings into its reporting currency)</li>
<li>Timing differences (Deposits in transit, time zones, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The simplest way to examine the relationship between cash, revenue, and deferred revenue is to understand the deferred revenue roll forward. A deferred revenue roll forward is a simple calculation that ensures incoming and outgoing activities to the deferred revenue balance are properly accounted for.</p>
<p><img src="https://leapfin.com/blog/content/images/2020/05/deferred-revenue-rollforward-1.png" alt="deferred-revenue-rollforward-1"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>First, let’s review deferred revenue itself.</p>
<p>Deferred revenue is a cash payment from a customer for goods or services to be provided in the future. Since the seller’s obligation has not been filled, the cash has not been earned, and the seller records this as a liability on the Balance Sheet via a deferred revenue balance. Deferred revenue is especially common among subscription and SaaS companies, in which payments are made upfront in exchange for service periods in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: On Jan 1, 2020 a customer makes a $120 purchase for a subscription service spanning Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
 <tr><td>Jan 1</td><td>Cash</td><td>$120</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td></td><td>$120</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>As the seller completes its obligations over time to earn the revenue, the deferred revenue balance on the Balance Sheet is reduced accordingly by the amount of revenue earned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: The seller recognizes revenue monthly based on the service period of Jan 1, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020. $120 across 12 months results in revenue of $10 per month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="generalledgerimpact">General Ledger Impact:</h5>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Month</th><th>Account</th><th>DR</th><th>CR</th></tr>
<tr><td>Jan 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feb 28</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr>
<tr><td>March 31</td><td>Deferred Revenue</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Revenue</td><td></td><td>$10</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>And so forth for April 30, May 31, etc...</p>
<p>At month 12 on Dec 31, 2020, the deferred revenue balance will be fully exhausted as the $120 cash payment would be fully recognized.</p>
<p>Check out our previous blog post on <a href="https://leapfin.com/blog/revenue-cash-reconciliation-for-subscription-businesses/">Revenue Cash Accounting for Subscription Businesses</a> for more detailed journal entries.</p>
<br><!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="cashisimportanttodeferredrevenue">Cash is Important to Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Since cash is an important part of the deferred revenue calculation, cash balance figures must be accurate for deferred revenue to be reliable. Accounting teams can be confident in their revenue figures by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performing cash reconciliations to verify that cash activity in the period is accurate</li>
<li>Comparing the deferred revenue roll forward calculation and deferred revenue balance in the general ledger.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the beginning deferred revenue, cash, and ending deferred revenue balances have been substantiated, then there is reasonable assurance that revenue for the period is also correct.</p>
<p>It may seem simple in this example, but calculating deferred revenue can be quite complicated. Because revenue is derived from sales in both the current and prior periods, companies with high volume of transactions and/or multiple product lines may experience additional difficulty calculating deferred revenue.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ES2020 has been out for a while. I guess a lot of <code>Node</code> developers have already adopted these features. Some even started using them when these features were still under proposal stages. Yep. My team started using some stage 3 features for quite a while.</p><p>In this article, I'm going to talk about my feelings of using these ES2020 features. As a result, I think those features are great and essential.</p><p>Contents:</p><ul><li><a href="#1-operator-nullish-coalescing">1. Operator: Nullish Coalescing</a></li><li><a href="#2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import">2. Asychronous Modules: Dynamic import</a></li><li><a href="#3-promiseallsettled">3.

Regex: String.prototype.matchAll</a></li><li><a href="#6-a-standardized-global-object-globalthis">6. A Standardized Global Object: GlobalThis</a></li><li><a href="#7-chain-with-elegance-optional-chaining">7. Chain with Elegance: Optional Chaining</a></li><li><a href="#8-module-namespace-exports-export--as">8. Module Namespace Exports: export * as</a></li><li><a href="#9-other-features">9. Other features</a><ul><li><a href="#for--in-loop-order">for ... in loop order</a></li><li><a href="#import-meta">import meta</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li><li><a href="#references">References</a></li></ul><h2 id="1-operator-nullish-coalescing"><a href="#1-operator-nullish-coalescing">1. Operator: Nullish Coalescing</a></h2><p>At the beginning, my idea of "providing exlicit explanation of your code" denies such improvement. I think since a value of <code>nullish</code> or <code>falsy</code> should be given a thorough "explanation" under an <code>if condition</code> or some other strategic <code>function</code>. In this way, I could also add some extra logics without refactoring the shorthand expression later.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> website <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

<span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span>website<span>.</span><span>url</span> <span>!==</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>typeof</span> website<span>.</span><span>url</span> <span>===</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  url <span>=</span> website<span>.</span><span>url</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>But I made compromise quickly after trying "nullish coalescing" everywhere in the project. My concern was proved unnecessary. Because what I want is to make sure the target variable has concrete value in most of the scenarios.</p><p>In Typescript, operating a <code>nullish</code> value will probably be given errors or warnings. This means my code can be optimized easily by following the expostulation.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> url<span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>=</span> website<span>.</span>url <span>??</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span></code></pre><p>In brief, my feeling toward <code>nullish coalescing</code> is quite supportive. It' going to be very helpful while assigning non-nullable value to a variable.</p><h2 id="2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import"><a href="#2-asychronous-modules-dynamic-import">2. Asychronous Modules: Dynamic import</a></h2><p>I've been using this feature since stage 2. You know, our apps needs that ability of "Just in Time".</p><p>It helps me import Javascript / JSON files as modules in my application. And now it can just show up anywhere in my project (mostly for front end. Haven't experience it on server side). Have to say this feature is indispensible.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> answer <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./myanswer.json'</span><span>)</span>

<span>import</span><span>(</span><span>'./component.js'</span><span>)</span>

  <span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2 id="3-promiseallsettled"><a href="#3-promiseallsettled">3. Promise.allSettled</a></h2><p><code>Promise.all</code> has brought us a useful solution to the famous "callback hell". Nesting functions is truly nasty.</p><pre><code>
<span>getUp</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>eatBreakfast</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>As you know, <code>Promise.all</code> will throw errors once one of the tasks encounters exceptions. I never hope that I can't eat breakfast without washing my face.</p><p>Of course, I can add <code>finally</code> to the <code>Promise</code> chain to make sure eating breakfast. But <code>finally</code> doesn't provide the correct context I wanted. Don't even have to mention using <code>catch</code> to eat breakfast, that's a bad practice.</p><p>Finally, <code>allSettled</code> permits us to set a callback whenever I wash my face or brush my teeth. I just want that breakfast! It feels like you grew up and move out of parents' home. So mom's scolding about washing face and brushing teeth are gone.</p><pre><code>

Very Large Number: BigInt</a></h2><p>The Javascript <code>Number</code> type used to range from <strong>-(2<sup>53</sup>-1)</strong> to <strong>2<sup>53</sup>-1</strong> (Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER ~ Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).</p><p>With this new API, any large number can be process properly in browser without losing any precision.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> bitInteger <span>=</span> <span><span>BitInt</span></span><span>(</span><span>9007199254740995</span><span>)</span>



<span>let</span> bitInteger <span>=</span> <span>9007199254740995n</span></code></pre><p>In my case, big integers are converted into <code>String</code> to avoid precision issues before they are carried out to the front. It is indeed a rare case to use <code>BitInt</code> at the moment in my project. I believe there are other general demands around this features in other projects.</p><p>A simple example I can come up with is: If a database's model ID is numberic and fairly long (like a shopping order ID), then when it is passed onto the frontend the <code>BigInt</code> can come into help.</p><h2 id="5-regex-stringprototypematchall"><a href="#5-regex-stringprototypematchall">5. Regex: String.prototype.matchAll</a></h2><p>Actually <code>matchAll</code> has been proposed for a long time. It returns an <code>Array</code> containing all matched characters. Compared to <code>match</code>, the return type <code>RegExpStringIterator</code> gives us a consistant result whenever the string matches or not. By using tools like <code>Array.from</code> I could finally pull all results from the <code>iterator</code>.</p><p>This after all is a good improvement in my humble opinion. Because the returned data type is always the same.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>'https://pitayan.com'</span>

A Standardized Global Object: GlobalThis</a></h2><p>Sometimes the JS code needs to cross platform, but Node.js uses <code>global</code> which is different to browser's <code>window</code> (web worker uses <code>self</code>). So before starting everything, I need to handle the environment compatibility first.</p><pre><code><span>const</span> globalThis <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>global<span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>,</span> self</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>(</span>global<span>,</span> <span>window</span><span>,</span> self<span>)</span></code></pre><p>I personally think that identifying the environment is the duty of the lanuague system. So the <code>globalThis</code> is something that filled the nasty gap. Really really appreciated this feature's release.</p><h2 id="7-chain-with-elegance-optional-chaining"><a href="#7-chain-with-elegance-optional-chaining">7. Chain with Elegance: Optional Chaining</a></h2><p>I've used this feature since stage 2. It helps reduce a lot of <code>if conditions</code> or <code>ternary operators</code> which made my code look much simpler.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> food <span>=</span> restuarant <span>&amp;&amp;</span> restuarant<span>.</span><span>cooking</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> restuarant<span>.</span><span>cooking</span><span>.</span><span>food</span>

<p>This week I received the latest 14in laptop from Lenovo, the T14s (AMD gen1). Below are some of the tweaks / setup I’ve done on my machine (and generally all my laptops) which typically increase the battery life (with no noticeable reduction in performance).</p>

<p>The specs are as follows (Lenovo Thinkpad T14s):</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU – 8 Core, 16 Thread – AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 4750u</li>
<li>GPU – AMD Renoir</li>
<li>DISK – 2Tb – M.2 NVME SSD – 970 EVO Plus</li>
<li>RAM – 32 Gb</li>
<li>DISPLAY – 1080p low power (ISP)</li>
<li>KEYBOARD – backlit English</li>
</ul>
<p>As all my machines run on Arch Linux (with Gnome as the GUI), I went ahead and installed the latest build. It worked out of the box, no issues, was up in about an hour.</p>
<p>However, it does requires quite a few optimizations to get power consumption down on a laptop. The goal is always to maximize battery life, while enabling all the functions you’d normally do on a machine.</p>
<h2>BIOS</h2>
<p>On any new laptop, it’s often possible to disable features you don’t need in the BIOS. For instance, any 3rd party software and unused components (such as fingerprint scanner), Bluetooth, etc. can switched off. Often, this will power down those components and save battery.</p>
<p>In this case, I turned off the following components (it’s possible to turn them back on, if needed):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ethernet LAN</li>
<li>USB Port</li>
<li>Memory Card Slot</li>
<li>Smart Card Slot</li>

<p>There is also some 3rd party software which apparently you can also uninstall:</p>

<p>That’s it! It’s possible to later turn on components if necessary. This should result in some minor reductions in power draw.</p>
<h2>TLP or PowerTop</h2>
<p>On the software side, the first step is to install <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerTop</a>. This lets you manage and monitor <em>almost </em>everything you’ll need related to power consumption: turning off components, increasing system wakes, etc.</p>
<p>This can get rather complex, but for brevity: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Powertop#Calibration_to_prevent_inaccurate_measurement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start with calibrating PowerTop</a>. I should note, this will run several measurements, changing screen brightness, fan speed, etc. and will take some time (few minutes), so be prepared:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --calibrate
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Launch powertop with sudo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Tab over to “Tunables” and turn on / off various recommendations. This can often result in 5-25% gains in battery life. To set all recommendations to “good”, utilize auto-tune:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo powertop --auto-tune</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically run all the possible recommendations.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’d like these changes to be persistent (aka not run the command every time you startup the laptop), it’s recommended you create a service:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/system/powertop.service</pre>

<p>Then enable the service:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable powertop.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This will automatically tune your computer to improve power utilization on boot (although it’ll slow the boot process 1-3 seconds).</p>
<p>It is also important to note that there is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TLP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TLP</a>, which also offers a similar service to PowerTop. There are some noticeable differences with TLP. TLP for instance, doesn’t shutdown all connected devices (i.e. PCI devices).</p>
<p>I personally chose TLP, but many other swear by PowerTop.</p>
<p>TLP requires a far more minimal setup:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>sudo systemctl enable tlp.service</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Suspend vs Hibernate</h2>
<p>The next improvement that can dramatically improve the time between charges is modifying the suspend behavior.</p>
<p>Don’t know what suspend is?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend to RAM</strong> – Keep machine state in RAM. This requires keeping the RAM powered, but power is cut to other components of the system (keyboard, monitor, etc.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, when a laptop lid opens, it instantly boots, often before the laptop is fully ajar. This lets you get “right to work”, but that requires the RAM to be constantly powered.</p>
<p>There is an alternative method, often called <em>Suspend to Disk</em> or <em>Hibernation</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Hibernation (Suspend to Disk)</strong> – Saves the machine state into the <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/all-about-linux-swap-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>swap space</em></a> on disk and completely powers off the machine. When the lid is opened / machine is powered on, the machine state is loaded into RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hibernation method can save power for very long periods, as it completely powers down the machine. The drawback is that (at least on my machine) it can take 10-30 seconds to boot into the prior state.</p>
<p>In addition, a <strong>swap file or partition is required</strong>. Note, it is recommend that the swap space is 2-3x than the available RAM.</p>
<p>The beauty, is it’s possible to marry the two methods called: <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em>. It’s possible to <em>suspend</em> for a duration of time (say one hour), then if the laptop isn’t brought out of <em>suspend</em> it will <em>hibernate</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend then Hibernate</strong> – Keep the machine state in RAM for a duration of time, then transition to <em>Hibernation</em> on disk.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should note, it’s also possible to do both <em>suspend</em> and <em>hibernate</em> at the same time, in the case of power loss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suspend and Hibernate</strong> – The machine state is copied to the <em>swap space</em> and continues to be stored in RAM. The RAM will continue to draw power, but if power is lost the machine state can be recovered.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Closing the Lid</h2>
<p>The most effective power saving method (as discussed above) is to hibernate, every time.</p>
<p>However, it can be rather annoying to close a laptop, realize you need something, then reopen it and waiting 30 seconds for it to boot.</p>
<blockquote><p>Is a 30 second delay in booting your laptop worth the power savings?</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, most people should say it’s a worthy trade. Thirty seconds is a negligible amount of time, given we often open our laptops for hours.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s something primal about being able to open a laptop and being “ready-to-rock” in less than a few seconds. With that in mind, I used the <em>Suspend-then-Hibernate</em> configuration. The <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> behavior will let the computer quickly boot for some specified amount of time (say 2 hours), after which it will enter the hibernation state.</p>
<h2>Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>First, to configure the <em>hibernate</em> behavior, simply edit the following files.</p>
<p>To get <em>hibernate</em> configured, inform GRUB where and how to swap. I personally recommend a swap partition over a swap file as the swap file appears to cause issues in some machines[<a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>].</p>
<p>To accomplish this, find the swap partition, and add the UUID to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.</p>
<pre><strong>$ sudo lsblk</strong>
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
nvme0n1     259:0    0  1.8T  0 disk 
├─nvme0n1p1 259:1    0    1G  0 part  
├─nvme0n1p2 259:2    0   64G  0 part [SWAP]
└─nvme0n1p3 259:3    0  1.8T  0 part /
<strong>$ sudo lsblk -f | grep SWAP</strong>
├─nvme0n1p2 swap   1 &lt;UUID&gt;  [SWAP]</pre>
<p>Add the resume=UUID=&lt;PARTITION UUID&gt; to the following file:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>

<p>From there, you can start hibernating by adding the MAJ:MIN values for the swap partition to /sys/power/resume with the following command[<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate#Hibernation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>]:</p>
<pre>sudo echo 259:2 &gt; /sys/power/resume</pre>
<p>It should then be possible to hibernate.</p>
<p>To make the changes to GRUB on boot, execute the following:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>At this point, a reboot is recommended.</p>
<h2>Suspend-Then-Hibernate Configuration</h2>
<p>Once it’s possible to enter &amp; wake from the hibernation state, we can then transition to the <em>suspend-then-hibernate</em> step. For this, we have to configure systemd to handle entering <em>hibernation</em> from the <em>suspend</em> state after a given period.</p>
<p>There are two edits here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a delay in the sleep.conf, which will inform systemd how long to stay in the suspend state before hibernating.</li>
<li>Inform systemd the behavior of the power switch, lid closing, and suspend state.</li>
</ol>
<p>See the file edits below:</p>
<pre>/etc/systemd/sleep.conf</pre>

<pre>/etc/systemd/logind.conf</pre>

<p>The above enables closing the lid or clicking power button to trigger a <em>suspend-then-hibernate state.</em> For the first 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will be kept in RAM. After 45 minutes (in this case), the machine state will write to disk and power down.</p>
<p>When the lid is next opened, if the machine is in the&nbsp;<em>suspend</em> state (&lt;45 minutes), logging in will take a second or two. If the machine is in the <em>hibernation</em> state, the system will power up, load the machine state into RAM, then let you login (~25-30 seconds).</p>
<h2>Quickly Recovering from Hibernation</h2>
<p>One quick way to speed up recovering from hibernation is to reduce the time the grub menu is up. To edit this, go to:</p>
<pre>/etc/default/grub</pre>
<p>And edit the following command, I changed it from GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to:</p>
<pre>GRUB_TIMEOUT=1</pre>
<p>This saves an addition 4 seconds on boot, although this does mean you’ll have to act fast if you need to utilize the grub menu. After that, you’ll have to execute the following command for it to take effect:</p>
<pre>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</pre>
<p>Beyond speeding up GRUB, you can run the following command to analyze the boot up process via <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Improving_performance/Boot_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">systemd-analyze</a>:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze
Startup finished in 5.566s (firmware) + 2.088s (loader) 
+ 1.010s (kernel) + 9.702s (userspace) = 18.368s 
graphical.target reached after 9.614s in userspace</pre>
<p>To get a more detailed list use the blame or critical-chain argument:</p>
<pre>$ sudo systemd-analyze critical-chain
The time when unit became active or started is printed after the "@" character.
The time the unit took to start is printed after the "+" character.

                        └─<a href="https://austingwalters.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="196a606a6d7c747d347b787a7275707e716d597b787a7275707e716d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:amdgpu_bl0.service @2.609s +12ms

<p>In this case, it appears the network manager is the real bottleneck. This is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Enable_NetworkManager_Wait_Online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known issue</a>, and can be addressed by disabling the NetworkManager-wait-onine.service. Although, it should be noted this could cause your system to fail to boot, if the network daemons require internet connection (highly unadvised to use such systems on a …</p></div></article></div>

If you’re sure your browser is blocking enough of it, you don’t have much to worry about. You have very less chances of finding a website that does 0 tracking – so you should be equipped to protect yourself from those that do.

        <p>Much advocacy of Haskell, in general, boils down to type-safety and elimination of bugs. How boring. My personal experience is that bugs are trickier in Haskell and I can write bad code in an extraordinary variety of ways.</p>
<p>I don’t code in Haskell to help eliminate bugs. That seems a goal unlikely to produce joy in my code. I write Haskell primarily because in enables me to name things a bit better.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-learning">What is Learning?</h2>
<p>As an example, I came across this quote within the first few pages of a popular online course on machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. ~ Tom Mitchell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how I unpacked this into types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | learning is to use experience to change the performance of a task.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p <span>=</span>
  <span>Learn</span> { change <span>::</span> (<span>Foldable</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p }

</code></pre></div><p>A common approach to newtypes is to label the unwrapping as a reversal of the newtype (such as <code>unlearn</code> or <code>unLearn</code>) but this misses an important naming opportunity: to use a Learn is to change.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | An experience is set of e's</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Experience</span> f e <span>=</span> <span>Experience</span> { set <span>::</span> f e }
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | A task takes an e and measures performance.</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> { measure <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> p } <span>deriving</span> (<span>Profunctor</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This could be thought of (and coded) as an ordinary function with type (e -&gt; p). The advantage of using a newtype, however, is to highlight the two ways that a task can change:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing the way a task is performed (the <code>e</code>).</li>
<li>changing the way a task is measured (the <code>p</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Acting on a learning, you can change the way a task is performed, such as changing parameters of a function, or change the way you view what performance is.</p>
<p>To change the way a task is performed, taking experience into account, is to make progress. Progress is made one step at a time.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | To progress, is to transduce a Task, via a carrier</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>=</span> <span>Progress</span> { step <span>::</span> e <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> e p}
</code></pre></div><p>Putting these above types together in a useful way, to learn, is then to repeatedly apply a progressive step to a set of experiences.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to learn, is to make Progress from an Experience.</span>
<span>learn</span> <span>::</span> <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Learn</span> f e p
<span>learn</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Learn</span> $ <span>\</span>(<span>Experience</span> e) task <span>-&gt;</span> foldr (step p) task e
</code></pre></div><p>To <code>machine learn</code>, we change the way a <code>machine</code> does a task, based on learning, measuring whether performance improves, and adopt the new way to do a task if it does.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>-- | to improve, given a way to change a task by experience, </span>
<span>--</span>
<span>-- you need to choose the better performace way over an experience set.</span>
<span>improve</span> <span>::</span>
  (<span>Ord</span> (f p), <span>Foldable</span> f, <span>Functor</span> f) <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Progress</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Experience</span> f e <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p <span>-&gt;</span>
  <span>Task</span> e p
<span>improve</span> progress es task <span>=</span>
  bool task task' (p' &gt; p)
  <span>where</span>
    task' <span>=</span> change (learn progress) es task
    p <span>=</span> measure task &lt;$&gt; set es
    p' <span>=</span> measure task' &lt;$&gt; set es
</code></pre></div><p>The constraints contained in the above code are mostly based on suggestions from ghc to get a compile, and I didn’t think about them much in drafting. Type constraints provide useful guide-rails for future development of these ideas.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-in-haskell">Machine Learning in Haskell?</h2>
<p>In the above example of improving we are left with an <code>Ord (f p)</code> constraint - that the performance over an experience set is ordinal. If we narrow the constraint to a <code>Num (f p)</code>, in other words, assume that the size of the <code>f p</code> is meaningful, then we have wandered in to the traditional numerical methods domain, and can, for example, start to think about gradients to speed up our improvement.</p>
<p>By insisting on useful and concrete names (aka types), Haskell supplies a constrained domain we can further explore.  For example, are there machine learning examples that don’t fit the candidate types and constraints?</p>
<p>Naming things is hard, and other ways of coding tend to avoid the task. Types bring me joy and I shall keep them, thank you very much, and continue to curate collections of them, for fun and profit. In this example, I now have as good a definition of machine learning as you’ll find out in the wild, and my progress on machine learning will be more comprehensive, faster and safer than bashing away in python.</p>
<p>And yet, to a first degree, machine learning in Haskell does not exist, swamped by the easiness of dynamic types. If the promises being made by ML are to be eventually honoured, however, it may need less code bashing and better naming.</p>

And by both measures, the numbers are dramatically lower.</p>  <p>Births considered very premature —&nbsp;born at fewer than 29 to 32 weeks&nbsp;— have&nbsp;dropped by&nbsp;34&nbsp;to 40 per cent, he said.</p>  <p>"If we use their gestational age and if we are talking about the very earliest preemies,"&nbsp;Alshaikh&nbsp;said.</p>  <p>"That's kind of dramatic, actually, and surprising for us."</p>  <p>The numbers are even more dramatic for babies under one kilogram.</p>  <p>"If we used birth weight, those babies born less than one kilo, the number was actually very low and half of what we used to see in the last few years, during the same period of time of the year."</p>    <p>Alshaikh said the trend is very unusual.</p>  <p>"Soon after the lockdown in mid-March, we started to see fewer babies coming to our unit and to intensive care units, and these numbers of preemies were also low in April and mid-May," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"So by that time, by late May, we felt like we needed to look at the numbers, and see where we are. And also at that time we started hearing that other hospitals, in Ireland and Denmark, have also noticed the drop down in the number of preemies."</p>  <p>When Calgary doctors took a good look at the numbers and compared them to the same time last year, it was an eyeopener.</p>  <p>"We were surprised," Alshaikh said. "We saw that our number is way lower than what we used to see during this period of time."</p>  <p>There are three main causes that doctors are looking at.</p>  <p>One is social distancing, which may have cut down on the amount of general infection from contact with others.</p>  <p>Another is less air pollution, from fewer cars being on the roads.</p>  <p>"This might actually help because studies in the past showed that air pollution actually increases the risk for preterm birth," Alshaikh said.</p>  <p>And simply not going out to work — resting — may be a final key.</p>  <p>"By staying home, a pregnant woman may have less stress from commuting and from work,&nbsp; and that might have helped them," Alshaikh said, adding it's too soon to know for sure which of these lockdown-related factors have contributed the most.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/premature-babies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/premature-babies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/premature-babies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/premature-babies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3068968.1431344120!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/premature-babies.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Calgary doctors who noticed a reduced number of premature births during the pandemic lockdown, are seeing those numbers rise again as restrictions have eased.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jim Lynch, Flickr cc)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>&nbsp;"We see sometimes variation during the year, but it's not to the degree that we see fewer babies," Alshaikh said. "And the fact that we see the same trend in Ireland, in Denmark in Australia, it's kind of surprising for everyone working in this field."</p>  <p>Preterm birth comes with a host of challenges for the babies and their parents.</p>  <p>"The risk is high on children and their families, and also medical care resources," Alshaikh said. "For children, the risk increases for vision and hearing problems, and also for learning disability. It's higher even as the gestational age goes down. For example,&nbsp; 24 weeks is at very high risk compared to babies born at 28 weeks gestation or at 32 weeks gestation."</p>  <h2>Doctors teaming up to study</h2>  <p>The Calgary doctors will continue to study the phenomenon, which could hold clues to reducing preterm births in general.</p>  <p>For now, Alshaikh said it's too early to provide any specific advice to pregnant woman — other than to avoid stress, try to rest at home, get a lot of sleep&nbsp;and focus on good nutrition.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've teamed up, actually, with the teams across the world, in Ireland and also in Denmark, and there is also a group in Manitoba working on this project, and we are hoping to understand more the ways to prevent the preterm birth, and also like to see if we can understand more on risk factors that are affecting preterm birth," Alshaikh said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the Calgary doctor said there is one alarming development already —&nbsp;as the lockdown restriction ease, those preterm birth numbers are already on the rise again.</p>  <p>"We are actually noticing, even in Calgary, that when the restrictions started to be eased, the number of preterm babies coming to our unit and intensive care is going up again, which is quite actually interesting for us," Alshaikh said. "And we are trying to tease out what factors are affecting this trend."</p>  <p><strong>With files from <em><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-97-the-homestretch">The Homestretch</a></em>.</strong></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h3>What is the Blueprint?</h3>

<p>The Draft Blueprint ("the Blueprint") is the "first draft" of Plan Bay Area 2050, integrating 25 resilient and equitable strategies from the predecessor <a href="https://www.planbayarea.org/2050-plan/horizon">Horizon initiative</a>. The Blueprint is a critical step in the Plan Bay Area 2050 process as the region strives to advance towards the adopted Vision of a more affordable, connected, diverse, healthy and vibrant Bay Area for all.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Input</h3>

<p><strong>Public input is key in the success of the Plan Bay Area 2050 Blueprint, and we want to hear from you in 3 easy steps:</strong></p>

<h3>From <em>Horizon</em> to the Blueprint to the Plan</h3>

<p>Before now, the Horizon Initiative tested strategies against a wide range of external forces, exploring which policies and investments were best prepared for an uncertain future – from rising telecommute levels to economic boom &amp; bust cycles to consumer preference shifts. Creating the Blueprint is a key first step toward creating the Plan itself, and thus the Blueprint planning phase will require iteration and deep engagement of the public, stakeholders and elected officials.</p>

<p>The Plan Bay Area 2050 Draft Blueprint weaves together transportation, housing, economic and environmental strategies, alongside an expanded set of growth geographies, to advance critical climate and equity goals. Designed to accommodate the 1.5 million new homes necessary to house future growth and address overcrowding, as well as 1.4 million new jobs, the Draft Blueprint integrates critical strategies to address our severe and longstanding housing crisis. With infrastructure investments in walking, biking and public transportation – as well as critical sea level protections designed to keep most Bay Area communities from flooding through 2050 – the Draft Blueprint makes meaningful steps towards the adopted Plan Bay Area 2050 Vision.</p>

<p>While still remaining fiscally constrained per federal planning requirements, the Draft Blueprint includes available revenues from Needs and Revenue assessments as well as new regional revenues for transportation, housing, economic development and environmental resilience.</p>

<h3>Highlights of the Draft Blueprint include:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Improving Affordability for All:</strong> The Draft Blueprint reduces the cost burden for housing and transportation, with even greater reductions for low-income residents.</li>
	<li><strong>Expanding Housing Opportunities:</strong> The Draft Blueprint integrates investments to build more than 400,000 new permanently-affordable homes.</li>
	<li><strong>Focusing Growth in Walkable Places:</strong> The Draft Blueprint focuses the majority of new homes and new jobs in walkable communities with frequent transit services.</li>
	<li><strong>Saving Lives and Protecting Communities:</strong> In addition to saving more than 1,500 lives from roadway crashes through 2050, the Draft Blueprint also protects 98 percent of housing units at risk of sea level rise inundation through the year 2050 with new resilient infrastructure.</li>
	<li><strong>Positioning the Region for Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Despite over $200 billion in new taxes in the decades ahead to pay for the bold strategies approved in February 2020, Bay Area businesses are forecasted to rebound robustly.</li>
</ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a><a href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This document is a gentle introduction to the double-entry counting method, as written from the perspective of a computer scientist. It is an attempt to explain basic bookkeeping using as simple an approach as possible, doing away with some of the idiosyncrasies normally involved in accounting. It is also representative of how <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/"><span>Beancount</span></a> works, and it should be useful to all users of <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/"><span>plain-text accounting</span></a>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not an accountant, and in the process of writing this document I may have used terminology that is slightly different or unusual to that which is taught in perhaps more traditional training in accounting. I granted myself license to create something new and perhaps even unusual in order to explain those ideas as simply and clearly as possible to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>
<p>I believe that the method of double-entry counting should be taught to everyone at the high school level everywhere as it is a tremendously useful organizational skill, and I hope that this text can help spread its knowledge beyond professional circles.</p>
<h2 id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping">Basics of Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#basics-of-double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The double-entry system is just a simple <em>method of counting</em>, with some simple rules.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by defining the notion of an <strong>account</strong>. An account is something that can contain things, like a bag. It is used to count things, to accumulate things. Let’s draw a horizontal arrow to visually represent the evolving contents of an account over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5b1da6643866c557b2a5ce687e70ee1db16b14de.png"></p>
<p>On the left, we have the past, and to the right, increasing time: the present, the future, etc.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume that accounts can contain only one kind of thing, for example, <em>dollars</em>. All accounts begin with an empty content of zero dollars. We will call the number of units in the account the <strong>balance</strong> of an account. Note that it represents its contents at a particular point in time. I will draw the balance using a number above the account’s timeline:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/842dcb36da9e0e70c35d1023d65d8a571062baf0.png"></p>
<p>The contents of accounts can change over time. In order to change the content of an account, we have to add something to it. We will call this addition a <strong>posting</strong> to an account, and I will draw this change as a circled number on the account’s timeline, for example, adding $100 to the account:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/5e5e7897a346355eccd4d21ec9485c3464a2d996.png"></p>
<p>Now, we can draw the updated balance of the account after the posting with another little number right after it:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/0c8a78dac61ae7fddde25761f036e7f379cad247.png"></p>
<p>The account’s balance, after adding $100, is now $100.</p>
<p>We can also remove from the contents of an account. For example, we could remove $25, and the resulting account balance is now $75:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/98e314125325ecc72262a73a21b74db3200414fd.png"></p>
<p>Account balances can also become <em>negative</em>, if we remove more dollars than there are in the account. For example, if we remove $200 from this account, the balance now becomes $-125:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/bdc8a23347040de123e3359a7c8f0cc253c6d7d2.png"></p>
<p>It’s perfectly fine for accounts to contain a negative balance number. Remember that all we’re doing is counting things. As we will see shortly, some accounts will remain with a negative balance for most of their timeline.</p>
<h3 id="statements">Statements<a id="statements"></a><a href="#statements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Something worthy of notice is how the timeline notation I’ve written in the previous section is analogous to paper account statements institutions maintain for each client and which you typically receive through the mail:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Amount</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>-25.00</td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>-200.00</td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Sometimes the amount column is split into two, one showing the positive amounts and the other the negative ones:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><em><strong>Date</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Description</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Debit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Credit</strong></em></th><th><em><strong>Balance</strong></em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2016-10-02</td><td>...</td><td></td><td>100.00</td><td>1100.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-05</td><td>...</td><td>25.00</td><td></td><td>1075.00</td></tr><tr><td>2016-10-06</td><td>...</td><td>200.00</td><td></td><td>875.00</td></tr><tr><td><em><strong>Final Balance</strong></em></td><td>875.00</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Here, “debit” means “removed from your account” and “credit” means “deposited in your account.” Sometimes the words “withdrawals” and “deposits” will be used. It all depends on context: for checking and savings accounts it is usual to have both types of postings, but for a credit card account typically it shows only positive numbers and then the occasional monthly payment so the single column format is used.</p>
<p>In any case, the “balance” column always shows the resulting balance <em>after</em> the amount has been posted to the account. And sometimes the statements are rendered in decreasing order of time.</p>
<h3 id="single-entry-bookkeeping">Single-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="single-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#single-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In this story, this account belongs to someone. We’ll call this person the <strong>owner</strong> of the account. The account can be used to represent a real world account, for example, imagine that we use it to represent the content of the owner’s checking account at a bank. So we’re going to label the account by giving it a name, in this case “Checking”:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/380ec8fea9ee9069411a61ccabcc838de44042ef.png"></p>
<p>Imagine that at some point, this account has a balance of $1000, like I’ve drawn on the picture. Now, if the owner spends $79 of this account, we would represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b24d8c1e40edf6fd7e9d768ba8f0df279cd41f0e.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if the expense was for a meal at a restaurant, we could flag the posting with a <strong>category</strong> to indicate what the change was used for. Let’s say, “Restaurant”, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/7ee843cd9b997a9447bb022d7d35121a820e296d.png"></p>
<p>Now, if we have a lot of these, we could write a computer program to accumulate all the changes for each category and calculate the sums for each of them. That would tell us how much we spent in restaurants in total, for example. This is called the <strong>single-entry method</strong> of accounting.</p>
<p>But we’re not going to do it this way; we have a better way. Bear with me for a few more sections.</p>
<h3 id="double-entry-bookkeeping">Double-Entry Bookkeeping<a id="double-entry-bookkeeping"></a><a href="#double-entry-bookkeeping" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An owner may have multiple accounts. I will represent this by drawing many similar account timelines on the same graphic. As before, these are labeled with unique names. Let’s assume that the owner has the same “Checking” account as previously, but now also a <strong>“</strong>Restaurant<strong>”</strong> account as well, which can be used to accumulate all food expenses at restaurants. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/3c380375442a643877c59660832bd7df6192e9cb.png"></p>
<p>Now, instead of <em>categorizing</em> the posting to a “restaurant category” as we did previously, we could create a matching posting on the “Restaurant” account to record how much we spent for food, with the amount spent ($79):</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b86a7242b92effc613f88bc0cc70381d72e774f0.png"></p>
<p>The “Restaurant” account, like all other accounts, also has an accumulated balance, so we can find out how much we spent in “Restaurant” in total. This is entirely symmetrical to counting changes in a checking account.</p>
<p>Now, we can associate the two postings together, by creating a kind of “parent” box that refers to both of them. We will call this object a <strong>transaction</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b77efafcf2d6a6f1afbfb13da70be2f892b339b4.png"></p>
<p>Notice here that we’ve also associated a description to this transaction: “Dinner at Uncle Boons”. A transaction also has a <strong>date</strong>, and all of its postings are recorded to occur on that date. We call this the transaction date.</p>
<p>We can now introduce the fundamental rule of double-entry bookkeeping system:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of all the postings of a transaction must equal zero.
</code></pre>
<p>Remember this, as this is the foundation of the double-entry method, and its most important characteristic. It has important consequences which I will discuss later in this document.</p>
<p>In our example, we remove $79 from the “Checking” account and “give it” to the “Restaurant” account. ($79) + ($-79) = $0. To emphasize this, I could draw a little summation line under the postings of the transaction, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/b4182b9f64113868123cbcec20d468ab18b2786f.png"></p>
<h3 id="many-accounts">Many Accounts<a id="many-accounts"></a><a href="#many-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There may be many such transactions, over many different accounts. For example, if the owner of the accounts had a lunch the next day which she paid using a credit card, it could be represented by creating a “Credit Card” account dedicated to tracking the real world credit card balance, and with a corresponding transaction:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/f85a66510ce2e3bb614edca76463a9c4752a7d26.png"></p>
<p>In this example, the owner spent $35 at a restaurant called “Eataly.” The previous balance of the owner’s credit card was $-450; after the expense, the new balance is $-485.</p>
<p>For each real world account, the owner can create a bookkeeping account like we did. Also, for each category of expenditure, the owner also creates a bookkeeping account. In this system, there are no limits to how many accounts can be created.</p>
<p>Note that the balance in the example is a negative number; this is not an error. Balances for credit card accounts are normally negative: they represent an amount <em>you owe</em>, that the bank is lending you <em>on credit</em>. When your credit card company keeps track of your expenses, they write out your statement from their perspective, as positive numbers. For you, those are amounts you need to eventually pay. But here, in our accounting system, we’re representing numbers from the owner’s point-of-view, and from her perspective, this is money she owes, not something she has. What we have is a meal sitting in our stomach (a positive number of $ of “Restaurant”).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-postings">Multiple Postings<a id="multiple-postings"></a><a href="#multiple-postings" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, transactions may have more than two postings; in fact, they may have any number of postings. The only thing that matters is that the sum of their amounts is zero (from the rule of double-entry bookkeeping above).</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at what would happen if the owner gets her salary paid for December:</p>
<p><img src="https://beancount.github.io/docs/the_double_entry_counting_method/media/18980f41275676c5c7cf3b39dd256512bb45b78b.png"></p>
<p>Her gross salary received in this example is recorded as $-2,905 (I’ll explain the sign in a moment). $905 is set aside for taxes. Her “net” salary of $2,000, the remainder, is deposited in her “Checking” account and the resulting balance of that account is $2,921 (the previous balance of $921 + $2,000 = $2,921). This transaction has three postings: (+2,000) + (-2,905) + (+905) = 0. The double-entry rule is respected.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask: Why is her salary recorded as a negative number? The reasoning here is similar to that of the credit card above, though perhaps a bit more subtle. These accounts exist to track all the amounts from the owner’s point-of-view. The owner gives out work, and receives money and taxes in exchange for it …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="internally">Internally</h2>
<p>I’ve managed a few small teams, and the worst situations always happen when I avoid conflict early.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, if Sam does 3 problematic things, I might only address 2 of them. Maybe I don’t want Sam to think I’m mean, or maybe I need Sam to stay encouraged. Regardless of my intent, it becomes increasingly difficult for me to address that 3rd behavior, and increasingly burdensome to spin my wheels serving as an unnecessary intermediary in Sam’s interactions, trying to create a buffer between that 3rd behavior and the rest of the office. This is obviously stupid and unsustainable, and becomes more awkward to correct over time.</p>
<p>This often creeps up in more subtle ways. A developer might provide a lot of critical feedback on every new round of designs. I want the designer to feel empowered and trusted, but I also want the developer to care about the overall product. It’s perfectly possible to strike a good balance &amp; accurately communicate with everybody… However, it’s human-instinct to optimize each message for the receiver, and to sliiiightly oversell the degree to which I agree with the developer’s criticisms, or to soften those same criticisms when speaking with the designer. These little tweaks, which feel like hard work &amp; good management in the short-term, can really snowball over time.</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/expectations.jpg" alt="A graph with time on the X axis and reckoning on the Y axis. It demonstrates that for any initial degree of misunderstanding, the expectations deviate further from reality until it is corrected."></p><p>To minimize the magnitude of reckoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good manager will force the reckoning sooner</li>
<li>A great manager will avoid the misalignment in the first place</li>
<li>An excellent manager will avoid this misalignment without making anyone feel bad</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="externally">Externally</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that the role of a great recruiter (or salesperson, marketer, director, or anybody) is to actually increase the degree of misalignment in the above graph… In other words, that they should oversell. In a large enough company, someone else downstream will have to deal with the reckoning:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/before.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters tell the truth, but 1 evil recruiter lies and is rewarded for it."></p><p>If this incentive system goes unchecked, it quickly devolves into a situation where everybody knows that everybody oversells, and so the common wisdom is to mentally discount any promise made by a salesperson, recruiter, marketer, engineer, or really anybody:</p>

  <p><img src="https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/alignment/after.jpg" alt="A graph where most recruiters lie, but the candidates all adjust their expectations accordingly. This causes the truthful recruiters to suffer, because their truth is also discounted."></p><p>I’ve noticed that a lot of mentorship involves helping newcomers recognize the overselling for themselves &amp; learn to navigate these worlds of semi-truths &amp; complex incentives. I’ve also noticed that this flavor of BS is always bad for the overall system / company / marketplace / world.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Externally, this pattern is unavoidable. Free markets will always be susceptible to some assumed misalignment, although regulations can help.</p>
<p>Within a company, however, this behavior is toxic. Whenever I see a team sugar-coating metrics, I know that it won’t be fun to work in implementation at that company. When the rubber meets the road, the fingers will start pointing.</p>
<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
<p>Here are some other things that I did to make myself miserable as a new manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lacking the confidence to make hard decisions, and offloading them to someone more confident but less informed</li>
<li>Waiting waaaay too long to fire people</li>
<li>Reading a lot of books on management, and expecting <em>my</em> manager to immediately live the ideals of those specific books</li>
<li>Trying to manage former peers without intentionally, drastically resetting the relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>I can avoid most of these by constantly asking myself what issues I’m avoiding today, and pursuing the ones that might turn into big issues later.</p>

        <div>
                        
            
            
<p>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data. </p>



<div><p>Tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank">FullStory </a>and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.clicktale.com/" target="_blank">Clicktale </a>take these one step further and actually provide real-time playback of what a user is doing on a website. This is also possible across sessions and even can follow a user from signup all the way through onboarding – it’s really up to you. At first glance, this seems like a godsend. The ability to actually watch what people do on your site – where they get stuck or what they’re reading when they ultimately convert or exit is one of the more powerful funnel optimization tools to come out in the past decade. I personally can attest to their efficacy. They helped me drop a SaaS CAC from $1,250 to $100 in 3 months. </p><p>There are many other instances in which I have gone into a business, implemented one of these tools, and improved conversion rates by an order of magnitude in a fraction of the time it used to take. In just a few days of watching sessions it is possible to tell:</p></div>



<ul><li>What is preventing users from converting</li><li>Where are customers losing interest in the page</li><li>Why people are dropping out of the checkout process</li><li>What content users focus in on and what they skim past</li><li>What part of the site or app crashed and how did it happen</li></ul>



<p>These are all incredibly powerful insights in the hands of a skilled marketer, so what gives? Why doesn’t everyone secretly record their users and optimize based on the data? First, its helpful to understand what session replay is, and what it isn’t…</p>



<h2>What EXACTLY is Session Replay?</h2>



<p>Session Replay is precisely what it sounds like – the ability for the site owner, or someone else, to replay the session a specific user experienced while on the site. It includes scroll activity, mouse activity, clicks, swipes, taps, and just about any other action you can think of on a website. It has a lot of other names but session replay is generally the widely accepted term that these SaaS platforms use themselves.</p>



<p>It lets you see EXACTLY where someone gets stuck so that you can design a way to fix it and reduce the friction within whatever action you’re trying to get a user to take. It can also let you remotely diagnose speed or loading issues for customers – taking it one step beyond tools like Lighthouse. Being able to see specifically which files load slowly in the real world and on real users’ devices is amazing from an optimization standpoint.</p>



<p>With that being said, these tools themselves carry a pretty heavy payload and can slow down your site by a double-digit percentage on their own. On their own they are not enough to improve the efficacy of your site or app – they need to be wielded by a scrappy marketer who can identify the issues and implement solutions to solve them. </p>



<h2>Visionary or Voyeur?</h2>



<p>While periodically I feel like a voyeur when using these tools, I do see the benefits and generally feel they outweigh the privacy concerns. In my experience the friction in implementing these tools generally comes from the engineering team who feels like they infringe on privacy rights. Are they right? Well, sort of. Out of the box these tools have the ability to record usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information. That is where the implementation of the tool, both from a tech standpoint and from a configuration standpoint within the platform comes into play.  It is easy to block certain fields from recording into these tools, but generally, it has to be done manually.</p>



<p>FullStory blocks password and CC number by default but those can both be disabled by a less than honest marketer in order to get additional information about a customer. While I have never seen or heard that happening myself, it is certainly possible as these tools don’t require the obfuscation of some of the more sensitive data. </p>



<p>Some point to the feeling of “big brother” watching your users browse around on the website. Which is kind of what it is doing, but the blind spot here is that the marketer (me) generally doesn’t care who the user is – they just want to know what is getting in the way of the conversion, something session replay does better than any other tool out there at the moment. If the dataset were wiped of any personally identifiable information, it would still be useful to watch anonymized sessions move through a funnel and pinpoint friction.</p>



<div><p>Technically you’re also supposed to list the fact that you are using these types of programs within your Privacy Policy or EULA, and you’re even supposed to be able to toggle the script on or off within a “cookie bar” in order to totally comply with today’s regulations but I have yet to see that actually happen.</p><p>Additionally, who knows what these companies are doing with the data they have? Could they be mining it only to sell advice on optimizing funnels to the highest bidder? It really does allow for a lot of data and PII to cross into the unknown. How can someone even opt-out of this data collection if they wanted to? </p></div>



<h2>Are They Worth Using?</h2>



<p>The short answer is yes. On the surface you cant find a much more effective tool at optimizing the behavior on your website. The magic combo would be to combine session replay with a CRO tool like Optimizely or VWO to identify issues and then implement tests to counter them.</p>



<p>The longer answer depends on your conscious. In a time where people are increasingly worried about identity theft, facial recognition, and giving too much data to big tech companies, session replay does straddle the line between effective optimization tool and privacy nightmare. It’s worth evaluating the stance of your company on privacy and data security issues before implementing one of these tools.</p>

<p>The humble Casio F91W has been an iconic watch since it was first made in Japan back in 1989. Upon its release, it was sold for around $20 making it one of the world’s first affordable digital watches. Today, Casio still produces over 3 million of the F91W every year. The prevalence of this iconic timepiece through the years means it’s likely you’ve worn one at some point. If you have, then it’s probably the only thing you have in common with Osama bin Laden, Chechen militants, and Napoleon Dynamite. Congratulations!</p>



<p>As a kid in school, I personally remember being told off for talking in the back of the class. I had been caught excitedly telling my friends that I had just figured out what kind of watch the most wanted man on earth, Osama bin Laden, wears. As punishment, I was called up to answer the maths question on the board, at which I failed miserably. <em>”You need to focus on what matters! You can’t solve maths problems but you can tell everyone about the watches worn by terrorists?”</em> screamed my teacher. <a href="https://reaperfeed.com/about-reaper-feed/">Looking back</a>, I feel I prioritized the right kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>The Casio F91W was designed by Ryusuke Moriai which he described as “small, flat and simple”. The watch features a seven-segment numerical display on a grey LCD screen. Water-resistant, extremely durable and accurate to within 30 seconds a month, it’s a tried and tested piece of kit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing that’s to be said for international terrorists, they know a thing or two about choosing reliable products for waging war. The F-91W joined the ranks of other terrorist accessories like the Kalashnikov and the Toyota technical because it’s cheap, solid, and reliable. Oh, and it also doubles as a bombmaking accessory which we’ll look into later.</p>



<h3><strong><em>A Terrorist Fashion Icon</em></strong></h3>



<p>Whilst Casio has advanced further into combat watches through its iconic Casio G-Shock range, the F91W has remained the true battlefield accessory throughout modern warfare. Aside from iconic weapons, the Casio F-91W is the only branded accessory that Osama bin Laden was ever seen wearing in the open. Al-Qaeda was reported to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/prisoner/720.html">hand the watches out to recruits</a> at their terror training camps across Afghanistan and Pakistan throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Thus, it was al-Qaeda and bin Laden who arguably started the terrorist trend surrounding the watch.</p>

<p>During the height of the War on Terror, it didn’t take long for the US government to spot the prevalence of the Casio F91W amongst terrorists. In 2011, Wikileaks released a document labeled the “Matrix of Threat Indicators for Enemy Combatants” which was intended to assist staff at Guantanamo decide which detainees are more likely to carry out suicide attacks. According to the document, owning an F-91W was the biggest giveaway of a serious terror suspect alongside ownership of a satellite phone, a radio transceiver, or large quantities of cash.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t just paranoia. Statistics in other similar documents released by Wikileaks revealed that around a third of inmates being held at Guantanamo that were captured whilst wearing an F-91W had a known correlation with explosives. The F-91W watch came up almost 150 times in the piles of leaked <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gitmo/pdf/ym/us9ym-000840dp.pdf">Guantanamo prisoner assessments</a>. Ironically, four of the chaplains who worked at Guantanimo Bay also wore the watch.</p>

<p>One of the detainees at Guantanamo was grilled over the prevalence of the watch amongst suspected terrorists. He claimed that the water-resistant feature of the F91W watch was handy due to the Islamic requirement for followers to wash up to their elbows before prayers. Innocent enough explanation, right? Well not really. Interrogators smelled a rat when another prisoner claimed the prevalence of the watch amongst Jihadi inmates was simply due to the built-in compass that helped them pray towards Mecca. However, there is no compass in the F91W.</p>



<p>Despite the fairly frosty relationship between the two, ISIS didn’t let it get in between their choice of a good wristwatch. The F-91W was a feature of various ISIS militants including Tunisian born Tariq al-Harzi who was a high ranking Emir of the Islamic State. It was also worn by Kevin Chassin who was a French-born Jihadist who went to Syria to join ISIS. He was subsequently utilized for his high propaganda value in ISIS videos. </p>

<p>However, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi wasn’t so fond of the cheap Casio F91W. Instead, al-Baghdadi opted for a flashy watch that sparked debate over the exact model. The watch was spotted during his infamous speech in Mosul that declared the formation of the so-called Caliphate. It was believed to be either a Rolex or an Omega Seamaster, both of which run north of $3,000 and contradict the contents of his speech as well as his ideals.</p>



<p>It’s not just Jihadist terrorist groups that wear the watch. Introducing Subcomandante Marcos who, until recently, led the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Mexico. The photogenic insurgent leader was pictured in an iconic photo on horseback while smoking a pipe and wearing, you guessed it! </p>

<p>Of course, the watch is not only appreciated by the terrorists of the world but likewise by the people who combat them. Various fighting forces across the Middle East have been seen using the watch. Such as the Syrian Democratic Forces which is a coalition waging an anti-ISIS campaign across war-torn Syria.</p>



<h3><em><strong> How the Casio F91W Became a Bomb Makers Accessory</strong></em></h3>



<p>The Casio F91W is not only the terrorist’s timepiece of choice due to its ruggedness and reliability. Due to its long-lead timer, it also doubles as a bomb-making accessory for various terror groups around the world from Afghanistan to Chechnya. Deadly usage of the watch has been well documented through various case studies.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=696%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="Casio FW91" width="696" height="500" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=300%2C216&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/reaperfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/photo-casio-f91w-is-a-favourite-of-cia-s-terrorist-arm-al-qaeeda-supposedly.jpg?resize=585%2C420&amp;ssl=1 585w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>According to US intelligence officials, the watch doubles as a bomb timer as its alarm can be set beyond a 24-hour period. During the War on Terror, Pakistani ISI officials found more than 600 of the watches in a terrorist safe house in Karachi which led to a period of anybody being found wearing an F91W watch to be liable for arrest and questioning. However, with the watch being available for $4 dollars on Pakistani markets, simply possessing a Casio watch doesn’t prove anything and this tactic of arrest was soon dropped.</p>



<p>In September 1999, a series of bombs were detonated inside four Russian apartment buildings in the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buinaksk. The blasts killed 367 people and injured over 1,000 others. Russian investigators concluded that the attackers had been trained in terror camps being run by Ibn al-Khattab inside Chechnya which had recently gained unstable independence following the First Chechen War.</p>

<p>Investigations carried out inside Chechnya discovered that the bombs used in the attacks were comprised of ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder, with plastic serving as an intermediate explosive. The detonator? A combination of a Krona battery and a Casio F-91W. </p>



<blockquote><p>“about a third of inmates at JTF-GTMO [the unit in charge of Guantanamo] who were captured wearing one of these watches had a known correlation with explosives”.</p><cite>– Prisoner evaluation sheet from Guantanamo.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In 1994, an al-Qaeda militant named Ramzi Yousef used the Casio F-91W as a 4-hour timer on the bomb he constructed in an airplane toilet of Philippine Airlines Flight 434. He proceeded to leave his deadly work under the seat before leaving the plane. It detonated on the next flight, killing a Japanese businessman named Haruki Ikegami who sat in Yousef’s seat. Thankfully, the bomb’s orientation caused the energy to be mostly absorbed by Ikegami. Thus other passengers and the plane were not catastrophically damaged.</p>



<p>So, to round off this article I feel it’s fitting to make a comparison between Ryusuke Moriai and Mikhail Kalashnikov. Just like when Kalashnikov designed the AK47 intended solely for the defense of his motherland, the innovative inventor Ryusuke Moriai could never have predicted that his creation would go on an unstoppable path of its own and be used for far more sinister purposes than ever intended. Mr. Moriai had unwittingly created a watch ideal for modern warfare.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find a profound statement from Casio on the watch being used for deadly means by some pretty evil people. I was looking for something similar to what Kalashnikov said about the violent impact of his life’s work. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/28/casio-f-91w-watch-design-hipsters-al-qaida">The Guardian</a> approached the PR department for Casio hoping for a similar statement on the widespread use of the F-91W amongst global terrorists. But they just received a blunt email stating: “Casio is not making any further comment on the F-91W watch at this point in time.” Damn.</p>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>An irrational number is a number that can’t be represented as a fraction using integers for the numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of irrational numbers, and one of the biggest reasons for that is that they are great at making low discrepancy sequences, which give amazing results when used in stochastic (randomized) algorithms, compared to regular random numbers.  Low discrepancy sequences are cousins to blue noise because they both aim to keep samples well spread out, but the usage case is different, so it’s situational whether to use blue noise or an LDS.  That means that luckily there is room enough in the world for both LDS and blue noise.</p>
<p>This post is a random grab bag of things relating to irrational numbers.</p>
<p>Pythagorian cultists supposedly murdered someone to keep irrational numbers a secret, so this is technically forbidden knowledge, I guess.</p>

<p>Continued fractions are a way of writing numbers that can be useful for helping analyze irrational numbers, and rational approximations to specific numbers – whether they are rational or irrational.</p>
<p>If a continued fraction is infinitely long, that means it represents an irrational number, and all irrational numbers have continued fractions that are infinitely long.  If a continued fraction is not infinitely long, that means it’s a rational number.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of the continued fraction for pi.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pi.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Another way of writing continued fractions is to get rid of all the redundant “1 divided by…” and just write the integers you see on the left.  The continued fraction for pi above would look like this, which is a lot more compact:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how you make a continued fraction by walking through how to make it for pi, or at least 3.14159265359 anyways, since pi goes forever.</p>
<p>First up you take the integer part and use that as the first digit.  Subtracting that integer part out leaves you with a remainder:</p>
<p>[3]<br>
remainder: 0.14159265359 </p>
<p>We take 1/remainder to get 7.06251330592.  The integer part of this number is going to be our next number.  Subtracting the integer part out gives us our next remainder:</p>
<p>[3;7]<br>
remainder: 0.06251330592</p>
<p>1/remainder is 15.9965944095, which makes our next integer and remainder into:</p>
<p>[3;7,15]<br>
remainder: 0.9965944095</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.00341722818, so now we are at…</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]<br>
remainder: 0.00341722818</p>
<p>1/remainder is 292.63483365 so now we are at:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292]<br>
remainder: 0.63483365</p>
<p>1/remainder is 1.57521580653 and we’ll stop at the next step:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292, 1]<br>
remainder: 0.57521580653</p>
<p>Wherever you have a large number in the continued fraction, it’s because you just did one divided by a small number. The larger the integer means the smaller the remainder there was to make that integer.</p>
<p>The smaller a remainder is, the better approximated the number is at that step of the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This means that when you see a large number in a continued fraction, that if you truncated the continued fraction right before that large number, you’d have a pretty good approximation of the actual number that the continued fraction represents.</p>
<p>The larger the number, the better the approximation.</p>
<p>Because of this, looking at the continued fraction for pi, below, you can see that it has a pretty large number (292) pretty early in the sequence.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1,1,2,1,3,1]</p>
<p>This means that the following continued fraction approximates pi “pretty well”.</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1]</p>
<p>We’ll cover how to figure this out further down in the post, but that fraction is actually 355/113 and has a special name “Milü”, found by Chinese mathematician and astronomer, Zǔ Chōngzhī, born 429 AD.  It is within 0.000009% of the value of pi.</p>
<p>More info from wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil%C3%BC</a></p>
<p>So, while pi is probably the most famous irrational number, it certain isn’t the most irrational number that there is, as it is so easily approximated by smallish integers in a division.</p>
<p>Quick note if you write a program to convert a floating point number to a continued fraction: If you try to make a continued fraction for a number that a floating point can’t represent exactly – such as 4.1 – you will get a very tiny remainder which then makes a very large integer when you flip it over.  In my case, when using doubles, it made such a large number that converting it to an integer overflowed the integer.  One way to address this is to just consider any remainder smaller than some threshold as zero.  Like maybe any remainder less than 0.00001 can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So even though pi is not the most irrational number, phi is (pronounced “fee”, and is aka the golden ratio).  Yes, it is the most irrational number!</p>
<p>We’ll use the value 1.61803398875 and make a continued fraction.</p>
<p>[1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>[1;1,1]<br>
remainder: 0.61803398875<br>
1/remainder: 1.61803398875</p>
<p>Wait a second… do you see a pattern? the remainder is always the same value, and then when we do 1/remainder we always get the golden ratio again.  That means this continued fraction is 1’s all the way into infinity.</p>
<p>In the last section we saw how having a large number in the continued fraction meant that a number was well approximated at that point in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>The golden ratio has a 1 for every number in the continued fraction, which is the smallest value you can have. That means it’s as least well approximated as you can be, at every stage in the continued fraction.</p>
<p>This is what is meant by the golden ratio being the most irrational number.  It’s the least well approximated by rational numbers (dividing one integer by another).</p>
<p>When I said I liked irrational numbers I was mainly talking about the golden ratio, but other highly irrational numbers, like the square root of 2, are also nice.  Highly irrational numbers have the properties that I like – the properties that make them useful to use as low discrepancy sequences.</p>
<p>An interesting thing you may have noticed above is that when you divide 1 by the golden ratio, you get the golden ratio minus 1.  That is:</p>
<p>1 / 1.61803398875 = 0.61803398875</p>
<p>If you replace the golden ratio with “x” you get this equation:</p>
<p>1/x = x-1</p>
<p>If you solve that equation, you will get the golden ratio out.  It is the only number that has this property! Well actually, -0.61803398875 does too, and relates to the fact that there is a + and – root solution to that quadratic equation, but maybe that’s not that surprising.  1/-0.61803398875 is -1.61803398875. The behavior is the same, it’s just happening on the other side of zero.</p>
<p>Something else interesting about the golden ratio is that if you square it, it’s the same as adding 1.</p>
<p>1.61803398875*1.61803398875=2.61803398875</p>
<p>That gives you a formula:</p>
<p>x*x = x+1</p>
<p>If you solve that, you get the golden ratio again as the only solution (well, and the negative golden ratio minus 1 just like before).  Probably not too surprising if you look at the formulas though, as you can use simple algebra to change one formula into the other.</p>

<p>If you had a continued fraction and wanted to turn it into a regular fraction (or real number), you could run the process in reverse.</p>
<p>However, doing that means you start at the right most digit of the continued fraction and work left til you get to the beginning. How do you do this with an infinitely long continued fraction, like an irrational number would have?</p>
<p>Luckily there is a way to start at the left and work right, so that you can get approximations to infinitely long continued fractions (irrational numbers).</p>
<p>Let’s do this with pi, with this much of the continued fraction:</p>
<p>[3;7,15,1,292,1,1]</p>
<p>What you do is make a table which has a row for the numerator and denominator.  The first numerator is 1, and the first denominator is 0.  The second numerator is the first number in the continued fraction sequence, and the second denominator is 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0a.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>The formula for the rest of the numerators and denominators is…</p>
<ul>
<li>numerator[index] = CF[index] * numerator[index-1] + numerator[index-2]</li>
<li>denominator[index] = CF[index] * denominator[index-1] + denominator[index-2]</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing that from left to right, you get this:</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction0b.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Below we do that with pi, golden ratio, sqrt(2) and an irrational number i came up with that is not very irrational, and is well approximated by 1.01.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofraction3.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>A quick fun tangent is that you might notice that for golden ratio, both the numerators and denominators are the Fibonacci numbers.  This is the link between the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>Below shows the percentage error of each number, as more terms in the continued fraction are added.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror1.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>Golden ratio error decreases the slowest which shows that the golden ratio is least well approximated by fractions.  The made up irrational number that is approximately 1.01 has error decreasing the fastest because it is the least irrational of these numbers.  Pi shows itself as having fairly low irrationality, and the square root of 2 is fairly irrational.</p>
<p>Here is the error on a log y axis to better show the difference in error.</p>
<p><a href="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png"><img src="https://demofox2.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/cftofractionerror2.png?w=800"></a></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that 1/goldenRatio aka 0.61803398875 is every bit as irrational as the golden ratio itself is.  The reason for this is that we are flipping the numerator and denominator over for this fraction that doesn’t exist.  Flipping it over doesn’t make it more representable as a fraction.</p>
<p>When I’m using the golden ratio for low discrepancy sequences, i usually use that 1/goldenRatio value, also known as “the golden ratio conjugate” because the smaller value means it’s going to have fewer numerical issues and more precision, when working with small values (like between 0 and 1).</p>
<p>Also, there are an infinite amount of numbers just as irrational as the golden ratio.  You can calculate them by calculating:</p>

<p>where p,q,r,s are integers and the absolute value of p*s-q*r is 1.</p>
<p>That is the Moebius transform.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the least irrational number is, it looks like there are multiple (infinite) and they are just numbers that …</p></div></div>

    <p>How computationally expensive are various fundamental floating point mathematical operations? &nbsp;Here’s a quick and dirty benchmark, which, although surely quite naive, seems to capture the rough&nbsp;relative cost of a few operations.</p>

<h4 id="motivation">Motivation</h4>

<p>This quarter I am taking a course on&nbsp;numerical linear algebra. &nbsp;Naturally, we are covering topics like the fundamentals of floating point arithmetic, numerical stability, matrix decompositions, and algorithm analysis.</p>

<p>In a few of our assignments, we are&nbsp;tasked with determining the <em>exact number of floating point operations</em> (FLOPs) required to execute some particular algorithm. Analyzing the complexity of algorithms is certainly a useful exercise, but it’s silly to give the impression that we can produce the <em>exact</em> FLOP count. &nbsp;I’m not much of a hardware guy, but I at least know that modern CPUs are stupendously complex, and any FLOP count we can write down on paper after inspecting pseudocode has no chance at being “exact” in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Besides the overall futility of these exercises, we are instructed to&nbsp;consider each of the following operations as a&nbsp;baseline of “1 FLOP”: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root. &nbsp;As we will see shortly, these operations are not even close to equivalent in terms of real-world computational expense, so it’s misleading to count these all as&nbsp;equal atoms&nbsp;of computation.</p>

<p>Anyways… on one recent assignment we were asked to look at the FLOP count for some technique that used a rotation matrix. &nbsp;As you might expect for rotation-y stuff, the matrix entries were based on various trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, arctan). &nbsp;I was in a rush when doing the assignment, so I casually assigned 1 FLOP to each of these trig functions. &nbsp;I felt partially justified in doing this, as I had <a href="http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/" target="_blank">just learned</a> that these trig functions are in fact offered as single CPU instructions in modern Intel x86. &nbsp;Given that we were glossing over so much already, it seemed excusable&nbsp;to consider as atomic anything that can theoretically be done in a single CPU instruction. Regardless, I was&nbsp;docked points. Hmph.</p>

<p>OK fine, I’m not&nbsp;worried about the points, but now I’m&nbsp;curious about how expensive these operations really are. &nbsp;If “square root” qualifies as 1 FLOP, is it really so wrong to lump in “sine” as 1 FLOP, too?</p>

<h4 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h4>

<p>I dusted off the C++ region of my brain, and hacked up the following test program. It was fun to (ab)use macros heavily here.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

// timer cribbed from
// https://gist.github.com/gongzhitaao/7062087
class Timer
{
public:
    Timer() : beg_(clock_::now()) {}
    void reset() { beg_ = clock_::now(); }
    double elapsed() const {
        return duration_cast&lt;second_&gt;
            (clock_::now() - beg_).count();
    }

private:
    typedef high_resolution_clock clock_;
    typedef duration&lt;double, ratio&lt;1&gt;&gt; second_;
    time_point&lt;clock_&gt; beg_;
};

int main(char* argv)
{
    double total;
    Timer tmr;

#define randf() ((double) rand()) / ((double) (RAND_MAX))
#define OP_TEST(name, expr)               \
    total = 0.0;                          \
    srand(42);                            \
    tmr.reset();                          \
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000000; i++) { \
        double r1 = randf();              \
        double r2 = randf();              \
        total += expr;                    \
    }                                     \
    double name = tmr.elapsed();          \
    printf(#name);                        \
    printf(" %.7f\n", name - baseline);

    // time the baseline code:
    //   for loop with no extra math op
    OP_TEST(baseline, 1.0)

    // time various floating point operations.
    //   subtracts off the baseline time to give
    //   a better approximation of the cost
    //   for just the specified operation
    OP_TEST(plus, r1 + r2)
    OP_TEST(minus, r1 - r2)
    OP_TEST(mult, r1 * r2)
    OP_TEST(div, r1 / r2)
    OP_TEST(sqrt, sqrt(r1))
    OP_TEST(sin, sin(r1))
    OP_TEST(cos, cos(r1))
    OP_TEST(tan, tan(r1))
    OP_TEST(atan, atan(r1))
    OP_TEST(exp, exp(r1))
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>Compiling this benchmark non-optimized (so that nothing gets erased or rearranged) and running on my Intel Core i7 machine, I get the following results. &nbsp;I’ve normalized so results are relative to the cost of “plus.”</p>

<p><img src="https://latkin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FLOPchart1.png" alt="benchmark results"></p>

<p>So&nbsp;of the “1 FLOP” operations, it turns out&nbsp;division and square root are really about 4x and 6x as expensive, respectively, as the baseline of addition.&nbsp;Trig functions appear to land somewhere in the 15x-20x range, and exp about 10x.</p>

<p>So yes, trig functions&nbsp;really are significantly more expensive than +-*√ (though it still seems a bit arbitrary to count sqrt&nbsp;and division as 1 FLOP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Measuring the productivity of most professions is exceptionally challenging. Would you measure a lawyer’s productivity by the number of cases they close? Or a doctor’s productivity by the number of operations they perform?</p><p>Moving to the software engineering realm, should your company start measuring lines of code produced by engineers? Please no. How about pull requests per engineer? Nah. Sprint velocity on the company level? 😬</p><p>While it may be tempting to get started with these metrics, resist the temptation. These metrics reward output, people who put in immense amounts of busywork. Another issue with these metrics is that they create unhealthy team dynamics - your company won’t be more successful if teams compete internally, save that energy for competitors. Instead, your productivity metrics should focus on outcomes.</p><p>I’ve tried to summarize my thoughts on the company, team and individual levels.</p><h2 id="Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level"><a href="#Driving-business-outcomes-on-the-company-level" title="Driving business outcomes on the company level"></a>Driving business outcomes on the company level</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a recent study, the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerate</a> and to what conclusions Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim arrived after four years of research. They identified the following key performance indicators of high performing engineering organizations: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore and change-fail percentage. Let’s take a look at them, one by one.</p><p><strong>Lead time</strong> is the amount of time it takes for the engineering teams to ship a feature, end-to-end. While it may be challenging to do this across the board (as features will differ in scope), you can simplify it a bit, and define it as the time it takes someone from opening a pull-request till deploying it to production.</p><p><strong>Deployment frequency</strong> is more straightforward, as the name suggests, it represents the number of production deployments over a given period.</p><p><strong>Mean time to restore</strong> represents the amount of time it takes to restore service, once you had an outage.</p><p><strong>Change-fail percentage</strong> tells you what percentage of your deployments result in an outage that you have to restore.</p><p>The beauty of these metrics is that they are relatively simple to track. I bet you are already using some CI/CD pipelines, so the deployment frequency is given. Mean time to restore and change-fail percentage is something that your post-mortem meetings should already record. Without question, the most challenging metric here is around lead-times: it will be a compound metric that you’ll derive from code review times, CI build times and deployment times.</p><blockquote><p>While the mean time to restore and change-fail percentage metrics may seem like purely reliability metrics, they are not. The worse those indicators are, the more time engineers will spend on incidents and less on features that your customers are paying for.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Team-health-metrics"><a href="#Team-health-metrics" title="Team health metrics"></a>Team health metrics</h2><p>I believe that candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive, high-functioning team. Managers, whether they are front-line managers or above, play a crucial role in creating a feedback culture: a culture where every employee feels safe and comfortable providing feedback to other members of the team, or of that of the broader organization.</p><p>While trust is not simple to measure either, anonymous surveys can help with it. By doing surveys for your teams regularly, you can also keep track of your progress in different areas (trust is just one of them).</p><p>Questions like these (well, more like statements that people have to agree or disagree with) might give you some idea of how you, as a manager, do when it comes to building trust:</p><ul><li>“My manager proactively solicits feedback.”</li><li>“My manager creates a safe environment, built on trust and respect.”</li><li>“I can communicate openly with my manager and my team about our work, even when I disagree.”</li></ul><p>Other areas you might want to gauge are vision, alignment, learning and adapting. Questions like this may be useful:</p><ul><li>“My manager learns from mistakes.”</li><li>“My manager acts on the feedback they receive.”</li><li>“My manager communicates how our team contributes to the company’s overall mission.”</li></ul><p>Please note that while this section focuses on team health, most of the questions are about the team’s manager. The reason for that is because most team members will try to model their behavior based on their manager. The manager’s actions have a profound effect on what the team will treat as desired, accepted or discouraged behaviors.</p><h2 id="Competencies-for-individuals"><a href="#Competencies-for-individuals" title="Competencies for individuals"></a>Competencies for individuals</h2><p>So far, we’ve covered what productivity metrics may look like on the company and team level: let’s take a look at how productivity can be measured on the individual level.</p><p>In my opinion, the work engineers have to do is way too complex to be measured by a single metric, like the number of pull requests an engineer opens, or the number of RFC they write. No metric can do justice in trying to capture the real work. So why bother?</p><p>Instead, engineering productivity should be measured against career ladders (tracks). What’s common in the career ladders most companies have, is that they identify a handful of critical competencies and behaviors that the company values and rewards. <a href="https://www.progression.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progression.fyi</a> has a good collection of open-sourced career ladders that you can look at. One of the reasons most companies should have an easily accessible and discoverable career ladder is because it helps set the expectations for both engineers and managers on what’s expected of them, and what they need to achieve to advance in their career at their current company.</p><p>Okay, but what does it have to do with engineering productivity? Everything. Creating a career ladder is the perfect opportunity for setting the example of a productive engineer for each level. As a manager, you’ll have a clear set of expectations and standards for each level, which helps you coach team members, whether they are struggling in their current role, or if they are preparing for a promotion.</p><hr><p>This is far from everything, but it summarizes what I’ve been thinking about the topic in the past couple of months. What are your thoughts on the subject? Please share them in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In today’s, in the past and probably in the future world — the time is more valuable than money, and the right time waits for no one. Hence, we have to make the most out of it to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Time is an extremely scarce resource.</p>
<p><strong>Every one of us has 24*60=1440 minutes a day, and totally about 28000 days to live</strong> (that’s how many days an average person lives since being born). And by the time you read this, you may have already lost significant chunk!</p>
<p>Developers can organize their day, maintain a busy schedule, feel very bored and unfulfilled, and never have enough time. Why so? Because often, the tasks they are doing throughout their day do not excite them or align with what they want—their goals and dreams.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t work towards your dreams and goals, you aren’t investing your time in yourself—you are wasting it.</strong></p>
<p>Wasting time is a choice, and it’s one that is entirely within your control. It is really important to make this choice on purpose (and not accidentally) and use your time effectively.</p>
<p>That’s why you should try to make each minute of each day count because every minute you sit idly doing nothing or wasting time, there is someone out there working hard towards the same goal gaining the edge over you.</p>
<p>Moreover, making better use of your time is also saving time. I had to learn how to manage my time effectively and productively because I procrastinated a lot in the past.</p>
<p>And here are some straightforward strategies that you can use to utilize your time better and feel much more fulfilled, energized, and happier:</p>
<h2 id="-set-goals">🎯 Set goals</h2>
<p>When you have goals you want to achieve, you are less likely to waste time on things not related to those goals: everything you do starts feeling that it has a purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If nobody told you today... You have a purpose and never give up on your goals.</p>— GOOD JOB LARRY 🍊 (@LarryJuneTFM) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarryJuneTFM/status/1278045173629349888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Besides, <strong>it’s crucial to establish processes and systems to achieve those goals!</strong></p>
<p>A process is a step-by-step action that helps you efficiently and systematically reach your goals. Not having a process is worse than not having a plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-prioritize-things">💎 Prioritize things</h2>
<p>Most developers have thousands of things (projects!!!) going on at any one time. The key is to focus only on what matters the most to move you toward your big goal.</p>
<p>You should align your time with your big picture priority. Everything else should go on the do-not-do-list! <a href="https://www.inc.com/jory-mackay/warren-buffetts-personal-pilot-reveals-billionaires-brilliant-method-for-prioritizing.html">Here is how Warren Buffet approaches it.</a></p>
<p><em>“It’s said that a wise person learns from his mistakes. A wiser one learns from others’ mistakes. But the wisest person of all learns from others’ successes.”— John C. Maxwell</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-say-no">🙅‍♀️ Say “No”</h2>
<p>Here I am still in the development process, but it has already become much better. I say “no” much more often today.</p>
<p>When I have inquiries of any kind or even my own project ideas, I always reflect on this principle: <strong>if you say yes to this, you automatically say no to something else.</strong> Because you can only do one thing at a time, is this thing more important than other things for achieving my goals?</p>
<p>This way, whole kinds of projects or requests fall through the grid—the filter which recognizes what really matters for me, for my most critical resource—my time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-less-calls-less-meetings">📆 Less calls, less meetings</h2>
<p>Time is an incredibly valuable asset in a product company, and especially in a startup business. When you spend the day sprinting from meeting to meeting, the time flies by.</p>
<p>In fact, most meetings are pointless. Some people like to attend meetings for the sake of meetings. Hence, you could cancel 70%-80% or more of them, making no difference in your work.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you schedule meetings for your developers every few hours the only way they make progress is if they don’t pay attention to the meeting at all.</p>— Frank Wiles (@fwiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/fwiles/status/1245718151607828489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>Meetings might interrupt the workflow of individual contributors like developers and designers who need to concentrate for extended periods to deliver tangible value for the product. As a result, the working day of developers can turn into a long evening spending in front of the laptop while trying to mark some of those overdue items off their TODO-list.</p>
<p>Still, meetings are an essential function of communication on the team; that’s why it’s crucial to decide whether every scheduled meeting is worth your time before joining it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-time-for-emails">📬 Time for emails</h2>
<p>I don’t answer all emails immediately. I have a fixed time limit for emails; usually, I look at them just once per day, because answering emails and dealing with Slack/Teams messages can be scheduled just like everything else.</p>
<p>The power of time blocking for emails comes in choosing when you do this task instead of disturbing your focus and decreasing your productivity every moment of your day.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayooshin.com/time-blocking-elon-musk-manage-time/">Elon Musk uses the time blocking method to go through “critical emails” each day.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-automate-things">🤖 Automate things</h2>
<p><strong>We are programmers; we naturally don’t like routine and doing repetitive tasks.</strong> If it happens to us twice or more, we are looking for ways to automate it.</p>
<p>Especially in finance, this can be important. For example, automatic tracking of your expenses is one thing that can lead to financial freedom; it can be used to reduce our spending by tracking our expenses to free more cash from your dev-salary monthly investment.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="-be-in-the-moment">🚀 Be in the moment</h2>
<p>Thinking about the past is pointless. Our whole life is ruining because we think much more about the past and future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can forget about the present.</p>
<p><strong>The “now” is more important than anything:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you can do now, rather than what you can do in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You always have to focus on what you have now and what you could do with the thing you have now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain.”―Louis Tomlinson</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-dont-swap-money-for-time">📊 Don’t swap money for time</h2>
<p>And also don’t overspend money on useless things. <strong>Because the more you spend, the more time you need to recover this resource.</strong></p>
<p>Our income is indeed limited by time. Basically, we trade in 8-10 hours/day for income and have to wait years before obtaining the necessary job promotion with a fair chance that we may not get that promotion.</p>
<p>That’s why it is necessary to stop swapping money for the time by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Changing your mindset around earning and spending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building an asset that scales (like a side project that will bring passive income)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your “passive” money  and savings to make you more money—start investing or growing your side hustle</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://ilonacodes.com/financial-tips-for-freeing-extra-money-for-investment/">There are so many different ways to free money for investments without overworking or thinking of getting another job.</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ignore-distractions">⚡️ Ignore distractions</h2>
<p>We live in a modern world where it is incredibly easy to get distracted, for example, via Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Such interruptions cost not only precious productive hours but also valuable effort and energy. Instead, <strong>invest your time in more important things that will make you closer to your goals and dreams.</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about how to prevent distractions and sharpen your focus by reading the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324560">“7 Proven Strategies for Overcoming Distractions”</a> article.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-stop-letting-other-peoples-opinions-control-you">🤯 Stop letting other people’s opinions control you</h2>
<p>When you have to formulate your actions according to others, it actually wastes a lot of time too.</p>
<p>It can prevent you from doing the things you want to do or being who you truly are. Basically, you will tie yourself to the yo-yo of what other people think of you.</p>
<p><em>“The trouble is you think you have time.” – Buddha</em></p>
<p>You have better things to care about than the opinions of others on you because life gives us enough to deal with as is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time is the most valuable asset you own. Once it is gone, it is gone.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p><strong>Invest your time into making yourself a more knowledgeable and smart person, working for something that will pay you off today or tomorrow.</strong></p>
<p>Become a Pro at time management, stop undervaluing your time, stop swapping it actively for money, and instead start investing your time into a variety of assets, including yourself.</p>
<p>Soon you will be able to have <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357">the 4-Hour Workweek.</a></p>

</p>
<p>
Sometimes, all we really need is a big pile of logs 
</p>
</div>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Logging isn't cheap, so we often disable debug level logs (and lower) when we deploy our code to production. When things are going well, this isn't an issue. But when an error log pops up, much of the context around what was happening in the code is missing. A single line about the stack trace often just isn't enough. It'd be pretty nice to have a more detailed picture of what was happening at the time of failure. If only we had turned on those debug and trace logs.</p>
<p>Well, there's a reason we don't. Simply put, it's expensive. Often, there's an order of magnitude more debug and trace level logs than all other logging levels combined. So if we were to log it all, we'd have to spend multiples more.</p>
<p>We have to choose between a bad option and a worse option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't debug log and miss the crucial context when an error occurs</li>
<li>Log everything and pay up</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where most conversations around this end. Option 2 is a non-starter so we go option 1. If an error pops up we try to replicate the bug locally with debugging on and work from there.</p>
<h2>Using A Ring Buffer</h2>
<p>Luckily, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>. We have a third option. Use a ring buffer to store debug logs and flush it when an error occurs.</p>
<p>This technique is conceptually simple. It takes just a sentence to describe, and not much has changed about the way things are logged. We still use the same logging libraries and the same logging software patterns, but now we have access to far more information in our logs when things go wrong.</p>
<p>You can have your cake and eat it too. You can avoid logging verbosely while at the same time having access to those verbose logs when it matters.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Say that we're building a Django backend for our online widget store, and say that there's a bug somewhere in
the pseudo code below.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>
<span>def</span> <span>handle_order_post_request</span><span>(</span>req<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  customer <span>=</span> get_customer<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>not</span> is_authorized_customer<span>(</span>customer<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> HttpStatusUnauthorized<span>(</span><span>)</span>

  orders <span>=</span> get_orders<span>(</span>req<span>)</span>
  verify_prices<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 
  verify_inventory<span>(</span>orders<span>)</span> 

  checkout_info <span>=</span> process_order<span>(</span>order<span>)</span>
  save_checkout<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> HttpStatusOk<span>(</span>checkout_info<span>)</span>


<span>def</span> <span>process_order</span><span>(</span>orders<span>:</span> List<span>[</span>OrderItems<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> CheckoutInfo<span>:</span>
  logger<span>.</span>debug<span>(</span><span>"total price: %d"</span><span>,</span> order<span>.</span>price<span>)</span>

  total_price <span>=</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>[</span>order<span>.</span>price <span>for</span> order <span>in</span> orders<span>]</span><span>)</span>

  most_expensive_item <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span>
    orders<span>,</span> key<span>=</span><span>lambda</span> order<span>:</span> order<span>.</span>price
  <span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> CheckoutInfo<span>(</span>
    total_price<span>,</span>
    most_expensive_item<span>,</span>
  <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We've launched our widget store, and it's a hit. The widgets our flying off the shelves. Things are going
great but every once in a while our backend errors and a would-be customer leaves our site unhappy.
Without ring buffer logging, here are the logs.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is null</code></pre></div>
<p>Something is going wrong, but what is it? with just a single line error it's difficult to tell what's going
wrong even if we had the stack trace. However, if we had all the contextual debug logs we'd have far more
useful information:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>[</span>INFO handle_order_post_request<span>]</span> POST /checkout
<span>[</span>DEBUG get_orders<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> number of orders: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_prices<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> prices changes: <span>1</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG verify_inventory<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> items out of stock: <span>2</span>
<span>[</span>DEBUG total_price<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> total price: <span>0.0</span>
<span>[</span>ERROR save_receipt<span>]</span><span>[</span>ring_id <span>2022</span><span>]</span> non-nullable field most_expensive_item is None</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we see a more full picture of the story. The transaction began by processing two orders from the customer. One
of the prices were updated, but both items were out of stock.</p>
<p>Aha! when items were out of stock, they were removed from the checkout meaning that there was no most expensive
item since the list was empty. Now we know what to do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Now, this example isn't enough to tell you whether or not ring buffer logging is worth it for your codebase. I'm not going
to make an argument telling you what you should be doing when I have no context in what you deal with. But I definitely do
recommend playing around with it to see if it works for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-53">
	

	
	<div>
		
<p>In <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Beginning of Infinity, (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359" target="_blank">The Beginning of Infinity,</a> David Deutsch proposes that the creation of knowledge encoded in genes is similar to the creation of knowledge by people. Knowledge creation involves two phases. It starts with mutations, changes or errors in the replication of the DNA sequence, which are similar to our creative leaps or conjectures. This resembles the creative or brainstorming phase. Next, via natural selection, mutations or variations are selected for in order to survive particular environments. This resembles the competitive or argumentative phase. It involves selection of specific ideas among all the conjectures we have come up with. Let’s call the first phase hypothesis generation (mutations/variations) and the second phase truth filtration (natural selection).</p>



<p>The first phase requires a high velocity of creative, surprising ideas. The second phase requires a careful, reasonable breakdown of these ideas. Contributions to the first phase involve creativity at best and fraud at worst. Contributions to the second phase involve thoroughness at best and pessimism at worst. We need both.</p>



<p>This essay talks about the first phase, where what matters is that which is surprising. A mutation is a mutation only if it is different from the original, expected sequence; in other words, a surprise. One of the ideas in information theory, which underlies modern computing, is that information is surprise. What disseminates through Twitter is what is surprising. You scroll through the mundane and pause at the surprising. Billion dollar start-ups were surprising ideas. Investments that generated high returns were surprising. If they weren’t surprising, other people would have started these companies or invested in these ideas and then they would not have had outlier outcomes. Economic growth is surprising because it primarily relies on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf" target="_blank">flow of new ideas</a>. Stand-up comedy that works is surprising. One of the theories on laughter is that we laugh when we are surprised. </p>



<p>All these also need to be “true” in some sense, but they have to be surprising to begin with because if they weren’t, they would be arbitraged away, either emotionally (e.g. Twitter, stand-up) or financially (e.g. start-ups, investing). We crave surprise, however, we want it in appropriate doses. Sociologist Murray Davis said in one of his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="papers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004839317100100211" target="_blank">papers</a> that if an idea questions one of your weakly held beliefs, you accept it as interesting. If it questions one of your strongly held beliefs, you dismiss it as insane. (I think that if an idea is completely new and doesn’t wrestle with any of your beliefs, you might not notice it.)</p>



<p>What helps the first phase, hypothesis generation, is typically different from what helps the second phase, truth filtration. Truth filtration comes from peer review, markets, experiments, and democracy. It requires criticism, devil’s advocacy, error correction, and honesty. On the other hand, hypothesis generation requires coddling, encouragement, and a suspension of belief. It requires an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_theatre">improv</a>-like “yes and” rather than “no but”. It tends to come from solitude or small groups (e.g. Einstein, Satoshi Nakomoto, start-ups) because most large groups devolve into devil’s advocacy.</p>



<p>We have many institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for truth filtration. We can instinctually argue the other side when someone shares an idea. Twitter, Reddit, and Hacker News are all suited for truth filtration; users are quick to call out BS or offer counterarguments. Cunningham’s Law is a good articulation of this – “the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.” Mutations are “wrong” in some sense and most will never be selected for, however, they need to be encouraged to reach their potential before weeding them out. So while society has a plethora of mechanisms in place for truth filtration, it has poor institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses for hypothesis generation.</p>



<p>Some significant, especially new, ideas may begin as tentative hesitations. In Jony Ive’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="eulogy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnGI76__sSA" target="_blank">eulogy</a> of Steve Jobs, he said, “He (Jobs) better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily squished.” Solitude is a good starting point, but discussions with people add creative value – they make your mind race in interesting directions. Improv is a good framework to think about what helps hypothesis generation. The key elements of improv are listening, trying to find ways to make an idea work, and being present. We should have a few institutions and emotional responses that help respond to a new hypothesis by assuming that this is our new reality and running with it. These ideas are like newborn babies; they are too young to be killed with criticism, even if that is honestly what we think about doing at that moment.</p>



<p>In the first phase, anyway, truth does not matter as much as surprise. Instead of, “why could this be wrong?” a good response would be, “in what worldview could this be right?”. This involves suspending your belief for a moment and, like an improv artist, uncompromisingly building on what the other person is thinking and feeling. It is a pure engagement with the idea without bringing in how many other people have tried it before and failed. It is a fantasy world in which this idea is new, original, and deserving of being explored to its fullest potential. You want the hypothesis generator to leave the discussion feeling energized and with a fuller version of her idea.</p>



<p>Improv isn’t about mere agreement. Many times, agreement is as boring as disagreement. When someone says A, the typical response is “yes, A!” or “not A!”. A better response would be “if A is true, then B” or “why A?” or “A adds to C, which this other person proposed”. Improv involves deeply empathizing with an idea, identifying its premise, and then taking that premise in an interesting direction. A good response to A can’t just be B if B is unrelated, but B is a good response if you use the premise in A to get to B. When someone proposes A, we often think that the purpose of the conversation is to decide between A and not A. But A can lead to B, C, D, E, and an infinite number of other options, so merely agreeing or disagreeing with something exploratory isn’t as interesting.</p>



<p>In practice, it may be difficult in some cases to separate hypothesis generation and truth filtration. The process of creating knowledge is fluid; we are making creative leaps as we are discovering what is true. However, there are ideas for which this is clearer. The improv approach is suitable for early, exploratory ideas; for example, “what if everything is priced in life years?” or “maybe we can replace cars with …”. It isn’t suitable for long-drawn, argumentative ideas like “abortion should be legal”, “free will doesn’t exist”, “Seinfeld is better than Friends”, “intelligence isn’t inherited”, etc.</p>



<p>What’s misleading about the phrase “truth filtration” is that while we might think that we are filtering for truth, sometimes we are not creative enough to understand that something is true. Stewart Brand put it well – “Reality is routinely stranger than fiction because reality has no obligation to sound plausible.” Also, sometimes we might just be focused on winning an argument instead of finding the truth. Winning an argument often involves disproving the other side’s weakest point, while finding the truth involves trying to disprove your strongest point. It would be nice to have a platform with the thoughtfulness of Hacker News but that thoughtfulness put to build on rather than reject exploratory ideas.</p>



<p>Hypothesis generation is important because without mutations or creative leaps, there would be nothing for evolution to select for. We need more institutions, incentive structures, and emotional responses that encourage creative leaps; we need some version of improv for ideas.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Most overviews of register allocation are ridiculously complex and not at all practical. I hope, that by the end of this reading, you will gain a deeper understanding of the vocabulary and concepts that are often employed when discussing register allocation. Near the end, I’ll have a full-blown linear scan register allocator written in OCaml. If you want to follow along, you can find the code <a href="https://github.com/Heasummn/ocaml_reg_alloc" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-register-allocation">What is Register Allocation?<a href="#what-is-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I/O is slow. It is ridiculously slow. Reading from RAM takes about 50-100ns, reading from a register takes approximately 300ps. That is a difference of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. When you’ve got a program that requires every ounce of speed it can have, storing values in registers rather than RAM would result in a 1000x speedup. As compiler developers, it is our job to make sure that we are making full use of the registers available to us.</p><p>Register Allocation is a very interesting problem that arises in compiler development. How do we make the best use of registers while maintaining correctness?</p><h2 id="vocabulary-and-concepts">Vocabulary and Concepts<a href="#vocabulary-and-concepts" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>There are a ton of resources talking about register allocation out there, but a lot of them don’t stop and clarify the vocabulary that is being used. If you’re just looking for code samples, you can skip past this section.</p><h3 id="statement-ordering">Statement Ordering<a href="#statement-ordering" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Programs are trees, yet when talking about register allocation, we talk about the program as a sequence of statements. This is something that is often just glossed over and to be fair, it’s not very complex, but it’s not obvious either. We need some way of converting an AST into a sequence of statements that maintain dependencies. This is called a <strong>reverse postordering</strong> and is easily derived from a DFS. Most register allocation algorithms are applied per basic block, but can also be applied globally.</p><h3 id="liveness">Liveness<a href="#liveness" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>We say that a variable is <em>alive</em> if it is being used. We can represent this pretty easily using an array of start and endpoints, also known as <strong>live ranges</strong>. Register allocation becomes messy and a lot slower when using ranges, so instead we like to talk about just the start and endpoint of a variable’s life, also known as <strong>live intervals</strong>. We use liveness analysis when allocating registers, but it is also useful for type checking and some common optimizations, so computing the intervals is essentially “free”.</p><h3 id="spilling">Spilling<a href="#spilling" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Say we have 4 registers in our system and 5 variables that are alive at the same time. It is impossible to fit 5 gallons into a 4-gallon container, so we are out of luck. That won’t stop us though, we’re going to spill a variable. Spilling is the act of saving a variable into memory, rather than storing it in a register. To rephrase what we were saying earlier, we want a register allocation algorithm that minimizes unnecessary spilling. How do we choose which variable should be spilled though?</p><h3 id="heuristic">Heuristic<a href="#heuristic" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>There is no correct answer to the question we posed above. In a more positive tone, any answer is correct. We will choose something called a <strong>spilling heuristic</strong>, which is just how we decide which variable gets spilled. In linear scan register allocation, the algorithm that I’ll demonstrate in just a moment, the most common heuristic is to spill the variable that “dies” the latest.</p><h3 id="graph-coloring">Graph Coloring<a href="#graph-coloring" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h3><p>Graph coloring is the problem of giving each vertex in a graph a different color (from some fixed set of colors) than any of its neighbors. This is not a “compiler problem”, but it was discovered that register allocation can be simplified to graph coloring. If we draw a graph with every single variable as a vertex and an edge between them if they are alive at the same time, we get a <strong>register inference graph</strong>, which we can then color with the registers available to us. The only problems are that some graphs cannot be colored and graph coloring is NP-complete and computationally expensive. There is a clever algorithm developed by <strong>Chaitin et al.</strong> that handles spilling in reasonable time. I will not be going over the algorithm, but send me a message if you’re interested.</p><h2 id="linear-scan-register-allocation">Linear Scan Register Allocation<a href="#linear-scan-register-allocation" arialabel="Anchor"> ¶</a></h2><p>I promised code, let’s get to that code. From <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/course/cs132/linearscan.pdf" target="_blank">their 1999 paper</a> Poletto and Sarkar devised a ridiculously simple and clever algorithm for register allocation. We greedily assign and free registers until we can’t fit them in anymore, which is when we spill.</p><p>Linear scanning is ridiculously fast, but as you may have guessed, it does not produce optimal code. When <code>ocamlc</code> added an option for linear scanning, they saw compile-time improvements of almost 25%. The difference in performance between Chaitin’s algorithm and linear scanning is so minuscule that for a lot of applications it does not matter, but we like as much performance as we can have. Linear scanning is used most often in JITs, like Oracle’s Hotspot, because compilation speed matters a ton. This is the basic algorithm:</p><pre><code data-lang="none">LinearScanRegisterAllocation
    active ← {}
    for each live interval i, in order of increasing start point do
        ExpireOldIntervals(i)
        if length(active) = R then
            SpillAtInterval(i)
        else
            register[i] ← a register removed from pool of free registers
            add i to active, sorted by increasing end point

ExpireOldIntervals(i)
    for each interval j in active, in order of increasing end point do
        if endpoint[j] ≥ startpoint[i] then
            return
        remove j from active
        add register[j] to pool of free registers

SpillAtInterval(i)
    spill ← last interval in active
    if endpoint[spill] &gt; endpoint[i] then
        register[i] ← register[spill]
        location[spill] ← new stack location
        remove spill from active
        add i to active, sorted by increasing end point
    else
        location[i] ← new stack location
</code></pre><p>We enter the algorithm with all of the variables in our code represented as <em>live intervals</em>. In OCaml, we’ll define these to look like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>type</span> interval <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    reg<span>:</span> regs<span>;</span>
    location<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
    start_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
    end_point<span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>regs</code> is just an enum containing all the registers that we have. To make life easier for us, let’s define a constructor:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="ocaml"><span>let</span> make_interval name start close <span>=</span>
  <span>{</span>
    name <span>=</span> name<span>;</span>
    reg <span>=</span> <span>Spilled</span><span>;</span>
    location <span>=</span> <span>-</span>1<span>;</span>
    start_point <span>=</span> start<span>;</span>
    end_point <span>=</span> close<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

I’ve gone through the most common frameworks below, and how they differ for biotech companies. </p><p>I’m defining a tech startup here as a company whose product is largely based off of code. I am not including in my arbitrary categorization ‘deep tech’ (e.g., autonomous trucks, satellite startups, etc), which often face similar challenges as biotech companies. </p><p>Biotech here is a startup developing a drug. </p><p><em>These are generalizations, and many exceptions exist. </em></p><h2><strong>Risks and Finding Product Market Fit</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Significant market and execution risks<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Minimal market risk, a lot of technical risk</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_605840"><div><p>In tech, the company often uses a standard software stack and applies it in a novel way (a new product). The question is usually not ‘can this thing be built’, but ‘does anyone want this thing we made’?</p><p>In biotech, this is flipped. The market (a disease) is well established, but the ability to develop a product (a drug) that addresses this market is the core risk. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_607921"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Rolling derisking, early signs of product-market fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Derisking comes in bursts over years (biological milestones), early signals less reliable</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_617219"><div><p>In tech, you want the ‘up and to the right’ chart, showing exponential increase of some core metric of the company. Adoption, revenue, and other metrics derisk the company and give early signs of PMF. Early signs can be highly predictive of the company’s eventual success.</p><p>In biotech, derisking the company is predominantly tied to specific biological milestones. These come in bursts, with long periods of waiting in-between. Additionally, early milestones (such as the drug working in mice) aren’t 1-to-1 predictive of eventual success (the drug working in people).</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_619233"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Iterate to product-market-fit<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Product (drug) finalized years before on market</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_631626"><div><p>In tech, the product is constant iterates and improves from customer feedback to find the exact product that people want. </p><p>In biotech, due to the extensive regulation, the final product (the drug) is finalized years before it first goes into people.

If you want to modify the product, you need to restart the entire process over again. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_633705"><div><h2><strong>Founders &amp; Market</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around a market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often bring insight around key biology</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_651094"><div><p>In tech, a prototypical founder often worked at the incumbent company or realized a market opportunity by being that market themself. The insight around the market opportunity itself is a core value of the company. </p><p>In biotech, the insight of the founder is around a new or better way to develop a drug for the disease, or a discovery that was made in the laboratory (and the relevant patents around it). </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_665620"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often younger, ‘youth wunderkinds’ widely accepted <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Founders often older due to scientific training or are a professional CEO, rarer to have very young founders </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_678110"><div><p>In tech, the 18-year-old drop-out is lauded and mystified. If anything, older founders may be subconsciously discriminated against in favor for younger founders. </p><p>In biotech, the prototypical founder is older, often a career CEO or exec coming out of a Big Pharma company. At minimum, the founders almost always have significant scientific training - a PhD can take 6-8 years, and post-docs 2-3 years each. It is less common to see founders in their 20s and you almost never see ‘youth wunderkinds’. This is in part due to the conservatism of the industry and in part because extensive scientific training is generally necessary to have enough biological insight to correctly identify an opportunity. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_420694"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Can create a new market<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are diseases and therefore public domain</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_422265"><div><p>In tech, some of the most successful companies created or defined their market - a classic example being ride sharing. Once a new market is validated, other companies/copycats/fast-followers flow in. </p><p>In biotech, the market opportunities are diseases. New markets can somewhat be created (e.g., nootropics, elective medicines, Viagra) but generally speaking the markets are well known. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_423860"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Markets are winner-take-all<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Many winners</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_458802"><div><p>In tech, investors often bet on a specific horse with the hope that the horse will win the race (and all the earnings). Bifurcated markets can be especially dangerous as companies compete on pricing and ‘race to the bottom’.</p><p>In biotech, the markets are <em>so </em>large, and the unmet need so high, that there can and often are many winners in one market (disease). The classic example here are statins, which in 2020 had over $1 trillion in sales across seven market approved statins, with the best-selling Lipitor having peak sales of $12B in the mid-2000s. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_456236"><div><h2><strong>Product Strategy</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Often develop one product at a time, focus is key <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Portfolio approach is encouraged to de-risk company, exception is one-asset, repurposing plays</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_482826"><div><p>Focus is crucial for any startup. However, in biotech the most successful and valuable companies often take a portfolio approach to product development - developing multiple products simultaneously. In tech, companies generally focus around one product or core offering, only differentiating once they have earned the right to do so by finding PMF with their first product.</p><p>A significant reason for this is to derisk the company against biological randomness. Instead, focus in a biotech company is usually around a core competency - e.g., a method of discovering drugs, or a way of delivering the drug - and then diversified within this core competency. For example, gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics had a core competency of AAV-based gene therapy (a virus loaded with DNA to treat a genetic disease) but leverages this competency simultaneously across multiple diseases. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_484564"><p><strong>﻿</strong><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Outsourcing product development or engineering unadvisable<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Common to use contractors for key experimental work</strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_497310"><div><p>In tech, not having someone technical on the founding team is a classic ‘no no’. You generally should have the ability to build (and therefore rapidly iterate on and improve) your core product within the team. </p><p>In biotech, it is common and often preferred to use contract research organizations (CROs) for much of your experimental work. Some experiments can only be done by specialized CROs, and they often have advantages from scale that a startup cannot hope to replicate. Building and staffing a laboratory, including the multiple six-figure machines necessary, is impracticable and unnecessary for most companies. </p><p>Virtual biotechs - companies with distributed leadership and all research outsourced to CROs - have been popular long before it became the tech zeitgeist.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_499137"><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Fast-followers and copycats a significant risk<br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Strong patent protection </strong></p></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_570610"><div><p>In tech, being the first/best product to a new market is so important because once you validate a market’s need for a specific product, it is easy for others to copy and chip at your market share. This is especially common in traditional D2C brands, for example the many bed-in-a-box companies. </p><p>In biotech, patents are king. If you hold the key patent it is impossible for your drug to be copied. Once patents expire, however, there is a whole industry (generics) around copying drugs and selling them cheaper than the branded product. Because of the hundreds of millions it takes to develop a drug, it is almost impossible to commercialize a drug that is not able to be protected by patents, regardless of its efficacy. </p></div></div></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_568710"><div><h2><strong>Raising, Spending, and Making Money</strong></h2><p><span><strong>TECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn usually people costs <br></strong><span><strong>BIOTECH</strong></span><strong>: Primary burn R&amp;D</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594517769210_725052"><p>Biotech companies’ biggest line item is undoubtedly R&amp;D spend - funding to do research experiments necessary to find and develop their drug.

			<h2>On 15th July, Ben Arc published in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/an-open-letter-to-yanis-varoufakis-about-bitcoin">Bitcoin Magazine</a> an open letter addressed to me in a bid to convince me that I should re-assess my rejection of Bitcoin as a force for good; as a bulwark for democratising capitalism and paving the ground for socialism. Here is my reply:</h2>
<h3>Dear Ben Arc,</h3>
<h3>Thank you for your open letter and your efforts to bring a socialist perspective to bear upon my assessment of Bitcoin.</h3>
<h3>In my reply below, I shall address you as a fellow socialist, rather than put together a reply meant to address all sorts of different perspectives (e.g. Keynesian, Hayekian, neoclassical)</h3>
<h3>As you know, I am one of those who, back in 2011, were genuinely intrigued, fascinated even, by the remarkable blockchain algorithm. The prospect of a decentralised ledger controlled by its community of users was mesmerising.</h3>
<h3>As you also know, I was unimpressed by Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat money that is either likely, or indeed desirable, under our current capitalist predicament.</h3>
<h3>Having read your open letter, I remain as enthusiastic on blockchain’s capacities and as unimpressed by Bitcoin’s ability to help us either civilise or (as any socialist dreams of) transcend capitalism.</h3>
<h3>Two propositions support this view. In the hypothetical case where Bitcoin were, under presently-existing capitalism, to replace fiat money: (1) It would lack the mechanism necessary to stop capitalist crises from yielding depressions that benefit only the ultra-right; and, (2) Its community-based, democratic protocols would do little to democratise economic life.</h3>
<h3>I shall explain my two propositions briefly below. But, before you despair (at my continued negative take on Bitcoin), let me foreshadow the concluding sentence in the Epilogue below: Once (and, of course, if) socialism dawns, money will have to be founded on a distributed-ledger, monetary commons enabling tehnology.</h3>
<h3>In other words, I shall argue that Bitcoin is not fit for purpose under capitalism, or as a vehicle toward transcending capitalism, but something like Bitcoin will characterise monetary systems in a future world free of private banks and share markets.</h3>
<h3>OK, let me now support my two propositions:</h3>
<h2><strong><em>Proposition 1: Bitcoin lacks the shock absorbers necessary to prevent capitalist crises from doing untold damage to the working class</em></strong></h2>
<h3>Consider the Crash of 2008 or the more recent 2020 Covid-19-induced crisis. Suppose that Central Banks did not have the capacity instantly to create trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen – and instead had to rely on a spontaneous majority of Bitcoin’s users to agree to a massive increase in the supply of money. The result would be a 1929-like collapse of banks and corporations.</h3>
<h3>While socialists would shed no tears for the tragedy of the oligarchy, socialists should beware that a 1929-like systemic collapse is bound to strengthen the forces of the ultra-right – not of the socialist left (that has been, since at least 1991, languishing in the doldrums of political paralysis).</h3>
<h3>Technically, there is of course nothing that would prevent the Bitcoin community from agreeing instantly to even a doubling of the money base. However, the Tragedy of the Commons guarantees that Bitcoin owners will be subject to the usual prisoner’s dilemma dynamic that prevents the boost in the money supply necessary to avert the liquidation of potentially viable businesses and jobs. Moreover, this free-rider problem is made far, far worse by the fact that Bitcoin ownership is very unequally distributed, thus giving the Bitcoin-rich powerful incentives to restrain the growth of the money supply (since such restrictions would boost their private rents at the expense of the public interest).</h3>
<h3>In short, the free-rider problem that guarantees the maximal reinforcement of any capitalist crisis (in any economy relying on Bitcoin as its main currency) will be turbocharged by the unequal ownership of Bitcoin – which is unavoidable in any monetary system overlaid upon contemporary capitalism.</h3>
<h2><em>Proposition 2: Under capitalism, Bitcoin’s dominance will not democratise economic life – or give socialism a chance</em></h2>
<h3>Suppose, again, that some magic wand is waved and Bitcoin replaces fiat money under contemporary capitalist conditions. In other words, as Bitcoin replaced dollars, pounds, euros and yen, property rights over land, resources and machines remain as they are while private equity firms and pension funds continue to own the bulk of shares trading in Wall Street, the City etc. All that will have changed is that Central Banks will vanish and the community of Bitcoin users will determine the global money supply (subject to the free-rider problems mentioned above).</h3>
<h3>At the firm level, nothing will have changed. Jeff Bezos will still control a massive monopsony-cum-monopoly, Facebook will still own the whole marketplace within its platform, Exxon-Mobil will continue to lean on weaker developing country governments to drill for oil and gas that should be left in the Earth’s guts etc.</h3>
<h3>And what of private banks? They would, make no mistake here, find ways of creating complex derivatives based on Bitcoin – derivatives that will soon (just like Lehman Brothers’ CDOs prior to 2008) function as stores of value and means of exchange; i.e. as private money. Massive bubbles denominated in Bitcoin will build up and they will burst just as they did in the 19<sup>th</sup> century under the Gold Standard. And then?</h3>
<h3>In the absence of Central Banks and with the Bitcoin community in the clasps of the aforementioned free-rider problem, depression will follow – as it did before the Fed was instituted in the US. Thus, the tragedy mentioned in Proposition 1 above kicks in.</h3>
<h3>In short, not only will the democratisation of money via Bitcoin fail to democratise capitalism but it will also give an almighty boost to the forces of regression.</h3>

<h3>Bitcoin’s great appeal is that it breaks the cronyist chain linking central banks and private bankers. However, it does not undermine the cronyism of the network of bosses, politicians and private bankers.</h3>
<h3>Lest we forget, 19<sup>th</sup> Century bimetallic America also lacked a central bank. Under the gold and silver standards, the public money supply was fixed – and could not be easily manipulated by the state (either the government or the, then non-existent, Fed). But that did not stop private bankers from leveraging public money out of thin air to create huge quantities of private money with which to fund the Robber Barons, i.e. the Jeff Bezoses, of the era.</h3>
<h3>In this sense, replacing fiat money with Bitcoin would take us back to a postmodern version of 19<sup>th</sup> Century America – not exactly a prospect socialists should go to the barricades for.</h3>
<h3>In summary, the monetary system is like the dog’s tail. It cannot wag the capitalist dog, in the sense that democratising money by means of a monetary commons will not democratise economic life but, rather, make capitalism uglier, nastier and more dangerous for humanity.</h3>
<h3>Having said all this, a monetary commons (that may very well rely on something like the blockchain underpinning Bitcoin) will, I have no doubt, be an essential aspect of a democratised economy; of socialism.</h3>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The software ecosystem has a lot of useful but unsafe code, and the easier it is to sandbox that code, the more
often that’ll happen. If it were as simple as passing the compiler a <code>--sandbox</code> flag
that makes an unsafe library unable to see or affect anything
outside of it, that would be incredible! We can’t get it quite that easy,
but this post describes <strong>WasmBoxC</strong>, a sandboxing approach that is
very simple to use. All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compile the unsafe library using a <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (wasm) compiler instead of the normal system compiler</strong>.
That uses wasm internally, but you don’t need to care about that —
all you see is it emits a C file with sandboxed code.</li>
  <li><strong>Write some C to interface with the compiled C of the unsafe library</strong>. (This is
necessary because the sandboxed code can’t access outside memory, and also it
uses the portable wasm ABI.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compile and link that C code, and now that unsafe library is sandboxed from the rest of your application!
In a later section we’ll see concrete examples of how easy both those steps are.</p>

<p>Here is the approach in more detail:</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc.png" alt="unsafe code => safe wasm => safe c => safe native"></p>

<p>By <strong>compiling to wasm</strong> we sandbox the code, preventing it from accessing
anything on the outside.
That includes both <em>memory</em> - the sandboxed code can’t read or write to anywhere outside it -
and <em>capabilities</em> - the sandboxed code can’t do anything but pure computation,
unless you give it a function to call to do things like read from a file, tell
the time, etc.
We also get the rest of the wasm guarantees on
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/security/">safety</a> and
<a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/portability/">portability</a>. Wasm
sandboxing is even safe to run in the same process as other code (at least modulo
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre-type</a>
vulnerabilities), much like
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Software Fault Isolation (SFI)</a>.</p>

<p>After we’ve compiled an unsafe library to wasm, how can we run it as part of our
application?
We could integrate a wasm VM and run the wasm there. But instead,
with WasmBoxC we take a <strong>VM-less</strong> approach and compile the wasm into native
code, while preserving the wasm semantics, including the sandboxing.
That native code can be linked normally into an application, which
is much simpler than integrating a wasm VM.</p>

<p>The specific approach WasmBoxC takes to compile wasm into native code is to
<strong>compile it to C</strong> using
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/master/wasm2c">wasm2c</a> tool,
and then run a standard C compiler on it. In fact,
WasmBoxC’s approach compiles into a <strong>simple subset of C</strong>.
This is a big part of what makes this approach so simple, and
brings several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s easy to read and verify the generated C for security.</li>
  <li>It lets us use a C compiler like clang or gcc to make the sandboxed
code very fast.</li>
  <li>It’s very easy to use the code in existing build systems.</li>
  <li>It’s easy to write code to interact with the sandbox.</li>
  <li>A single build of C code can be compiled and run on practically any platform,
and code to interact with the sandbox also only needs to be written once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the simplicity of using C, WasmBoxC sandboxing has low
overhead: just <strong>14%</strong> with some non-portable C code (the
“signal handler trick”, see later), or <strong>42%</strong> in 100% portable C
(with no OS- or CPU-specific operations at all). We’ll also see that there are options
in between those 14% and 42% numbers.</p>

<p>The basic idea in WasmBoxC is simple and
<a href="https://twitter.com/FlohOfWoe/status/1011523018428780544">not original</a>.
What is
new in this post is showing that the approach works, doing
benchmarking on real-world code to show it is fast, presenting complete examples of how
easy it is to sandbox real-world libraries, and writing up the approach in
detail to describe the benefits (see in particular the section on memory-safe
languages).
This post also invents a name for the technique.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>To get an idea of WasmBoxC’s speed, let’s take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/tests/test_benchmark.py">20 benchmarks</a>,
comparing clang 9.0.1, clang 11 (dev version as of May 23 2020), gcc 9.2.1, and
WasmBoxC. All numbers are normalized to clang 9 (which is therefore equal to 1; lower numbers are better).</p>

<p><img src="https://kripken.github.io/blog/assets/wasmboxc-perf.png" alt="performance results"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>compiler</th>
      <th>relative speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 9.0.1</td>
      <td>1.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>clang 11 (dev)</td>
      <td>0.97</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gcc 9.2.1</td>
      <td>0.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (explicit)</td>
      <td>1.42</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WasmBoxC (OS-based)</td>
      <td>1.14</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These benchmarks include a wide variety of code, and the ones prefixed with <code>zzz_</code> are real-world
codebases or benchmarks:
the 
<a href="https://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_(software)">Bullet</a>
physics engines, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coremark">CoreMark</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK</a>
benchmarks, the
<a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> VM (one GC and one computational benchmark),
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
and
<a href="https://zlib.net/">zlib</a>
compression libraries,
and the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.
Incidentally, this shows WasmBoxC can run all of
these today!</p>

<p>Two results are shown for WasmBoxC, representing two implementations of memory sandboxing. The first is <strong>explicit</strong> sandboxing, in which each memory load and store is explicitly verified to be within the sandboxed memory using an explicit check (that is, an <code>if</code> statement is done before each memory access). This has <strong>42%</strong> overhead.</p>

<p>The <strong>OS-based</strong> implementation uses the
“<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1442/files#diff-e962256d2c336a13791ce03c1dae5d2fR106">signal handler trick</a>” that
<a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/3334d8dff757051c7a359818e0ceb5ad7852fdbc/js/src/wasm/WasmSignalHandlers.cpp">wasm</a>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17y4kxuHFrVxAiuCP_FFtFA2HP5sNPsCD10KEx17Hz6M/edit#heading=h.tbi7hpbheoai">VMs</a>
use.
This technique reserves lots of memory around the valid range and relies on
CPU hardware to give us a signal if an access is out of bounds
(for more background see section 3.1.4 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>).
That is fully safe and has the benefit of avoiding explicit bounds checks. It has
just <strong>14%</strong> overhead! However, it cannot be used everywhere (it needs
signals and CPU memory protection, and only works on 64-bit systems).</p>

<p>There are more options in between those 14% and 42% figures.
Explicit and OS-based sandboxing preserve wasm semantics perfectly, that is, a trap
will happen exactly when a wasm VM would have trapped. If we are willing to relax
that
(but we may not want to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/pull/1432">call it wasm</a> if we do)
then we can use masking sandboxing instead
(see section 3.1.3 in
<a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~gxt29/papers/sfi-final.pdf">Tan, 2017</a>),
which is 100% portable like explicit sandboxing and also prevents any accesses
outside of the sandbox, and is somewhat faster at <strong>29%</strong> overhead. Other sandboxing
improvements are possible too - almost no effort has gone into this yet.</p>

<p>An interesting thing happens in the <code>lua_binarytrees</code> and <code>havlak</code> benchmarks,
where WasmBoxC is actually faster than both gcc and clang in all sandboxing modes,
up to 32%! How can we beat normal native builds, and by so much?
<a href="https://twitter.com/kripken/status/1262092956070109185">Looking into this</a>,
both of these benchmarks use a lot of <code>malloc</code>s and data structures with pointers.
Like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI">x32 ABI</a>, wasm is 32-bit,
so pointers take half the space. Measuring the maximum process memory used
in <code>lua_binarytrees</code>, WasmBoxC uses 33% less which helps a lot with CPU cache usage.
While this makes a big difference on these two benchmarks, we are likely
getting some speedup on the others as well due to this factor, as on average x32
is faster than normal x64
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI#Details">by around 5-8%</a>.
Wasm is a nice way to get something
like x32’s benefits!</p>

<p>The benchmarking here measures performance <em>within</em> the sandbox. It
does not measure the speed of calls from the outside in or inside out. Such
calls can be very fast because the sandboxed code is just C, which means that
we can even inline across the sandbox boundary — safely! — if we do
LTO. I verified that happens in the sandboxing example in the next section,
see later. (Note, however, then using the signal handler trick may make things
more complicated here.)</p>

<p>Some final notes on performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can compile WasmBoxC’s C code with any native compiler. In the
above we did so always with clang 9 for simplicity. The results vary a little
when changing the compiler, for example the “explicit” sandboxing results go from
14% up to 16% with gcc 9.2 or down to 11% with clang 11. There’s nothing magical about
that 14% figure — we are at the point where native compiler differences matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Results should improve over time as wasm adds more performance features
like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd">simd</a> (note that the native compilers we
compared to may have gained an advantage from autovectorization).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That WasmBoxC can reach 14% overhead shows that the
cost of compiling through wasm (which cannot represent irreducible control
flow, for example) is fairly low, and also that current compilers to wasm are
not introducing significant unnecessary overhead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve done my best to measure everything here carefully and accurately, but
it’s possible I’ve made a mistake somewhere. Please check my work and see if you
get similar results!</p>

<h2 id="ease-of-use">Ease of use</h2>

<p>This section has a full example of WasmBoxC usage. Here are the source files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// my-code.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span>
<span>// We could also include the .wasm.h file for these,</span>
<span>// but let's declare externs manually for the example.</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>void</span> <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>)(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Initializing sandboxed unsafe library"</span><span>);</span>
  <span>wasmbox_init</span><span>();</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling twice on 21 returns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>Z_twiceZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>21</span><span>));</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"Calling something bad now..."</span><span>);</span>
  <span>Z_do_bad_thingZ_ii</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
  <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>"(this will never be printed, as the bad thing will trap)"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>main()</code> is pretty simple: Initialize, call something in the sandbox that does a
computation for us, and call something that will trap inside the sandbox.
(What’s with the <code>Z_</code> stuff? See later in “API”.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// unsafe-lib.c</span>

<span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</span>
<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>twice</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>__attribute__</span><span>((</span><span>used</span><span>))</span>
<span>int</span> <span>do_bad_thing</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>size</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// Allocate an unknown size here (so the LLVM optimizer doesn't know if the</span>
  <span>// store later down is valid or not).</span>
  <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>malloc</span><span>(</span><span>size</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// Write to an address that is definitely not in the sandbox (the default</span>
  <span>// memory size is much smaller), which in wasm will trap.</span>
  <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>1024</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>42</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// Avoid the optimizer knowing the store can never be observed.</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>twice()</code> does what you’d expect, and <code>do_bad_thing</code> does a store that will
definitely trap. (Ignore the details there; for this example we need the LLVM optimizer not to
remove the bad code as undefined behavior!)</p>

<p>And here’s how easy it is to use WasmBoxC to get a fully sandboxed library linked with our normal code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># build our main code to an object normally</span>
<span>$ </span>clang my-code.c         <span>-c</span> <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> my-code.o
<span># build the unsafe library to C with emcc</span>
<span>$ </span>emcc unsafe-lib.c          <span>-O3</span> <span>-o</span> unsafe-lib.wasm <span>-s</span> WASM2C <span>--no-entry</span>
<span># build the unsafe …</span></code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>The title of this post might be familiar to those of you who are members on Zip Recruiter. This was the subject of one of the more outrageous job postings I was sent.</p>
<p>In this post Iâ€™m going to share with you some of the most ridiculous job posts they have sent me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>I have a job that I think lines up well with your resume. It's new, so they don't have many candidates yet.</p>
<p><strong>full stack developer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY <strong>$20 hourly (USD)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now understand why they can't find any candidates...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you a super-star developer with a love of art?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now I'm done. </p>
<p>This is just one of many job posts like this that I keep getting. This company is offering a NYC-based "super-star" full-stack web developer only $20 per hour... in US Dollars (in case you couldn't assume that?).</p>
<p>If this were a one-off post I was emailed, I would say, man, that company is never going to find a developer, but it isnâ€™t. I receive a ridiculously high number (at least once per day) job post from zip-recruiter offering salaries below the poverty line.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Web Application Developer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY <strong>$10,000 - $60,000 annual (USD)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, glad to see that they are paying me in greenbacks and not Argentinian Pesos! This salary is about $40,000 - $90,000 below market rate of a decent junior level web developer.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lead JavaScript Engineer</strong> - [redacted] - New York, NY *<em>$150,000 - $175,000 Annually**</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This job is off to a great start. Decent salary for the job being offered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benefits Offered: <strong>401K, Dental, Medical, Vision</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good, good. Heading in the right direction, but I wouldnâ€™t have added this to the post if this didnâ€™t have flaws:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leading ticketing platform, with headquarters in Manhattan, are looking for a Senior C# Engineer to build and design APIâ€™s utilizing C#, Azure, .Net. This is an immediate start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there we are, looking at a role for a Lead JS Engineer, and somehow ended up on a Senior C# Engineer post. I guess they added the wrong title. Doesnâ€™t matter, though, I <em>AM</em> a Senior C# Engineer, so letâ€™s keep reading?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Lead JavaScript Engineer will ideal have the following attributes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3/4+ years building web applications in JavaScript</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And Iâ€™m lost again. JS, no C#, no JS with 9+ months experience?</p>
<p>I get it, Zip Recruiter is â€œcheap.â€� You get your first applicant for $10 (or free if you listen to ANY business podcasts), the job post goes out to dozens of job boards and thousands of emails. BUT if your first applicant is a C# dev that applies because they saw Senior C#, you have wasted your time, their time, $10, and if you want to see the other applicants, you have to upgrade your account and pay $375/mo until you call them to cancel (I know, because I still pay $10/mo to keep my account on pause because I donâ€™t feel like talking to people, and $10/mo is probably less expensive over 2 years than fighting with them to cancel my account is is worth, and they know it... fuckers).</p>

<p>Docker desktop and minikube are popular options for local development.  Do you need both installed for local development or can you save some RAM and run a only one  of them.  Below are some questions to help you decide which one to use in your situation.</p>



<p><strong>Which version of Kubernetes are you running in production? </strong></p>



<p>Kuberenets (k8s) is on a three month release cycle with an N-2 support policy. For example in July 2020 k8s 1.18 is the most recent GA release, 1.17 and 1.16 are currently supported. When k8s 1.19 is released 1.16 will fall out of support. Many organizations run the oldest supported k8s to minimize risk to production systems.</p>

<p>Docker Desktop includes a hard coded version of Kubernetes. For example at time of writing the most recent Docker desktop includes k8s 1.16.5 since that is the oldest supported version of k8s. </p>

<p>Currently it is not possible to change the version of k8s in Docker desktop. If you need an older version of k8s you will have to install an older version of Docker desktop.  Basically Docker is shipping  the  “most stable, widely used” version of k8s since many organizations run the oldest GA version of k8s in production.  </p>



<p> Minikube supports the most recent GA version of k8s plus the previous 6 minor versions.   You can pass minikube a command line argument to  launch a specific version of k8s. For example, <code>minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.18.3 </code>will launch k8s 1.18.3</p>



<p><strong>How do you build your container images?</strong></p>



<p>If you use a <code>Dockerfile</code> during development you will need to have Docker desktop installed, otherwise you won’t be able to run <code>docker build</code> to create a container image on your laptop. </p>



<p>If you are building your container image using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">JIB</a> that don’t require a local Docker daemon you can run minikube without Docker desktop.</p>



<p><strong>Do you need a local container registry?</strong></p>



<p>Minikube does not ship with a container registry. By default it will try to resolve container images from Docker hub and other public registries. If you need to build containers on your laptop and you want minikube to pull them form your laptop rather than a remote container registry you will benefit from running Docker desktop since it includes a local container registry. </p>



<p><strong>How do you manage local development dependencies? </strong></p>



<p>If your application depends on commonly used OSS databases, message queues, caches you will have to decide how setup these dependencies on your laptop. There are three reasonable choices. </p>



<ul><li>Install on laptop </li><li>Run with docker-compose</li><li>Run on minikube </li></ul>



<p>Installing directly on a laptop can be time consuming and error prone. If you work on multiple apps or services that need different versions of PostgreSQL or MySQL then development becomes more time consuming and error prone.</p>



<p>You can run dependencies using docker-compose  which has a nice developer friendly workflow. </p>



<ul><li>checkout code </li><li><code>docker-compose up</code></li><li>write code / run tests on laptop that use services running in Docker</li><li><code>docker-compose down</code></li></ul>



<p>With docker-compose we are running third party dependencies in simple repeatable manner. </p>



<p>Minikube can also be used to run third party dependencies such as MySQL and other tools. To do so you will have to write k8s deployment manifests and expose the services using a NodePort on the minikube vm ip address. </p>



<p>If you want to use docker-compose for dependencies then you will need docker desktop, otherwise you can get away with minikube. </p>



<p><strong>Are you using JUNIT with test containers ?</strong></p>



<p>If you are using the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/">test containers</a> project for your automated testing you will need to  run Docker Desktop since test containers does not currently support Kubernetes. </p>



<p><strong>Which Operating System are you using for local development?</strong></p>



<p>Docker Desktop is available on MacOS and Windows  and it includes both k8s and docker . On Linux the docker distribution only includes docker, so you will have to  install  k8s from another source.</p>



<p>Minikube is available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  If  you are looking for the same developer experience across Mac, Windows, and Linux then minikube is a good choice. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Use docker desktop if  </p>



<ul><li>You need to build  container images from <code>Dockerfile</code></li><li>You need a local container registry</li><li>You are managing your local development environment with docker compose</li><li>You are using test containers with junit</li><li>The version of Kubernetes included in docker desktop is the version  you want to use</li><li>Your developers are only on MacOS and Windows.</li></ul>



<p>Use minikube if</p>



<ul><li>You need to pick a specific version of Kubernetes to work with </li><li>You don’t need a local container registry</li><li>You are not using test containers with junit</li><li>You have developers using Linux, MacOS, and Windows</li></ul>



<p>Based on your answers to the question above it is quite possible that you will need to run both. </p>

<p><em>Be kind to your future self. If</em><em> you feel stuck, the best thing you can possibly do for future “you” is to make time to reinvent present “you.”</em></p>



<p>Six months ago, I was totally out of answers.</p>



<p>It was a chilly, dreary January day in Denver, Colorado. I had just left my job at a marketing company back home in Philadelphia, and I had no idea what I was going to do next. My only instinct, the day I left the office for good, was to book a flight for a short getaway to the Mile-High City, one of my favorite places to visit. I needed that space. I needed that clarity of mind. I was sick and tired of striking out in my search for meaningful work, and I didn’t know where else to look. </p>



<p>Just three years prior, I made the decision to <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">leave another unfulfilling office job to carve my own path</a>. At the time, I knew it was a huge risk, but it was something I knew I needed to do to have any chance of realizing my full potential. But on this cold and lonely day in Denver, it felt like Groundhog Day all over again. Walking down a quiet street in the city’s North Capitol Hill section, I saw my reflection in a café window. I saw no change.</p>



<p>In three years, I went from depressed office worker to world-traveler, to excited entrepreneur, to the pinnacle of the restaurant industry, and back to depressed office worker. Had I just spent those years chasing my tail? What had I accomplished besides coming full circle to yet another desk job?</p>



<p>If this was my master plan to reinvent myself and carve my own path, I was failing miserably. The problem was that I was relying too much on other people for opportunities to determine my future. The bigger problem was that I never gave myself the time to do it for myself.</p>







<h3><strong>The Missing Link</strong></h3>



<p>Running a restaurant for two of those three years since escaping the cubicle had left me with little time to even think, let alone sleep and shower. My family suffered for it. My girlfriend suffered for it. And my potential for the personal growth and freedom I so yearned for suffered for it.</p>



<p>While walking along the Pearl Street Mall in Denver, I did a quick mental calculation. There are only 24 hours in a day. No matter if you are just scraping by, or if you are Bill Gates, we all have the same amount of this most valuable asset—<em>time</em>. You spend a third of that time sleeping. When you account for the time spent eating, showering, driving, working, etc., you are left with a measly 2-3 hours. And that’s at best. With those remaining hours, you just want to spend it relaxing on the couch, unwinding from the day. When do you find time to reinvent yourself? How can you meaningfully change course from an unfulfilling path that is sucking up all of your time?</p>



<p>Sure, if you want to grind straight through each day, you are free to do that. While there are some mutants out there who have been successful using this method, it does not work for most of us. You simply cannot rely on willpower alone to build anything of quality and value in the long run. You have to get smart and build a reliable system that creates time and cultivates curiosity. On that day in Denver, I decided I needed to find more time to reinvent myself.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Find More Time</strong></h3>



<p>Coincidentally, Covid-19 took the world by storm shortly after I returned to Philadelphia. Was it a sign from the heavens that I was waiting for? Was it just a coincidence that I needed to recognize and take full advantage of? Whatever it was, it virtually cleared out months of time for me to reinvent myself. So I moved up to a cabin in the Pocono Mountains and got to work.</p>



<p>Even with the pandemic keeping many of us home, finding time still is a big problem. Working from home, handling kids, making dinner, handling the endless chores around the house, and making time to get outside to avoid cabin fever are among the responsibilities for those of us lucky enough to be working from home. Whether you are working from home, working on site, or simply looking for a better system for reinventing your life, I have a four-step, actionable process that will ensure your ability to pivot from an unfulfilling path.</p>



<h4><strong>Step One: Commit</strong></h4>



<p><em>“The difference between involvement and commitment is like ham and eggs. The chicken is involved; the pig is committed.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>– Martina Navratilova</p>



<p>The most important step of this entire equation is to commit to yourself. You must commit to making the change you so deeply desire. If not, then the rest of this process falls apart.</p>



<p>Just looking at yourself in the mirror and hoping for a change won’t do it. Looking at the Kardashians and wanting their life won’t do it. Chasing the highest paying job you can find won’t do it. Extrinsic motivation never works in the long run if you want to make meaningful change in your life.</p>



<p>You must have an intrinsic, in-your-blood, raging-fire type motivation. Everyone has it. Everyone has that “something” that gets them out of bed in the morning. It just depends on how much the fire has been dulled by years of unsatisfying work and sub-optimal habits.</p>



<p>For me, my intrinsic motivation is family. To reinvent myself is something I needed to do for my family (and a family of my own in the future). I never want to look at my reflection in another café window to see the same underachieving person. I needed to be better for myself and for my family. That is my driving force.</p>



<p>You could also use the <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/11/12-favorite-problems/">12 Favorite Problems</a> approach. There is no best approach to finding your purpose, but when I am out of answers, this method cuts straight through to the source.</p>



<p>Find that force in your own life—your “<em>why</em>.” Commit to reinvent yourself on a foundation of intrinsic motivation. Make it urgent, because you never know when your time on earth will be up. This is not a process for improving your life. This is a way of actively saving it.</p>



<h4><strong>Step Two: Simplify</strong></h4>



<p>Once you make this commitment to saving your life, you must take steps from the outset to clear a path. </p>



<p>Most of us, and I am surely in this group, can be hindered by clutter. Physical clutter, mental clutter, digital clutter, time clutter. All of this, whether conscious or not, serves to slow us down and overwhelm us.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Physical Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>I started by <strong>cleaning my work area</strong>. Getting rid of unnecessary papers, trash, and even objects that didn’t contribute to the look and feel of my work environment. Keeping only the necessary items in the physical spaces where I spend most of my time has made a world of difference. As I always say:</p>



<p><em>External Mess = Internal Stress</em></p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the power of your physical environment. Build a place that you are comfortable in, that motivates you, that facilitates calmness and thoughtfulness, that inspires you to do your best meaningful work. You will instantly become more efficient with your time.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Mental Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>This is possibly the toughest area to declutter. The mind is so complex, so unpredictable, and so ever-present that it is hard to even know where to start. </p>



<p>Pick one area that brings you the most stress. I started with quitting the news.</p>



<ul><li>By <strong>not watching the news</strong>, I have seen a drastic improvement in my metal state. It is a classic example of addition by subtraction. If a piece of news is important enough, it will find its way to me. But I’ll pass on being depressed by the never-ending stream of crime and politics.</li><li>Along the same lines, <strong>read less junk</strong>. Scrolling Buzzfeed and your Facebook timeline endlessly will do nothing but make you jealous and lethargic. Clear that head-space, and clear that time off your calendar for more useful activities that will get you on the path to achieving your goal.</li><li><strong>Meditate</strong>, or just simply give your mind some time to breathe. Constantly crowding it with unnecessary and stressful inputs will drain your ability and your inspiration for self-reinvention.</li></ul>



<h5><strong><em>Digital Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<ul><li><strong>Clean out your inbox</strong>. Better yet, schedule a time each week for “inbox-zero.” For me, that is every Sunday night. Being able to accomplish that goal before the new week is often the springboard I need to get off to an productive start.</li><li><strong>Clear your desktop on your computer</strong>. Create folders, label properly, and commit to maintaining your filing system. Clutter on your screen will lead to more feelings of overwhelm and ineffectiveness.</li><li><strong>Cut down on TV</strong>. You may be in the habit of watching Netflix with your loved ones when you have some free time. But turning off the TV and doing more interactive things with your family and friends can give you a boost in creativity and productivity that you wouldn’t normally get from passive screen time. Less TV is bound to free up a couple more hours per week.</li></ul>



<p>There are so many more ways to declutter your digital life. These are the three that have helped me the most.</p>



<h5><strong><em>Time Clutter</em></strong></h5>



<p>In our daily lives, we tend not to organize our time in the way we organize tangible areas like our desks, our homes, and our computers. Due to the invisibility of time, we often let our days become cluttered with insidious, time-sucking activities that will inevitably crowd out productive time each day. To fend off this type of clutter:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Block out time on your calendar for productive work</strong>. By scheduling your week ahead of time, you can visually account for where your time will go. I simply use the calendar on Microsoft Outlook. Many people use Notion or write it down by hand. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you make an effort to document it.</li><li><strong>Cut down on meetings</strong>. If someone needs to meet in person, see if a phone call will do. If they want to talk on the phone, see if an email will do. If they want to reach out over email, see if a text message will do. Be ruthless, yet respectful.</li><li><strong>Simplify …</strong></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
						<p>Online communities often grow from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grouped-groups-friends-influence-social/dp/0321804112?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thstsst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">small, enthusiastic, intelligent niche group</a> that is relatively self-policing to a larger, amorphous group that becomes stupider at a rate that’s an exponent of the number of users (the linked book is excellent on this topic). Initial moderators are usually enthusiasts and small groups are more like communities than cities. Later moderators, though, are usually adversely selected: What kind of person would voluntarily spend lots of time and energy policing a community for no money? Consequently, online community decline is often exacerbated by the moderator or moderators who eventually take over or seek power.</p>
<p>The psychology of someone who is willing to moderate a Reddit subsection—or any similar site, like many mailing lists—is not good. This sort of person is willing to spend a time at a thankless task that is hard to do well and rarely if ever remunerative.</p>
<p>Those who start at that task do so optimistically but often quit as their lives change or the task becomes more onerous. Who gets left? People with axes to grind; people with no sense of perspective; petty tyrants; and so on. I don’t use Reddit much for many reasons, but low moderator quality is one. I rarely bother messaging them because doing so is largely a waste of time.</p>
<p>The problem with moderators is not dissimilar from the problem of users: People who regularly have something interesting to say and the means to say it well get blogs, as I wrote in “<a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2013/06/05/social-news-sites-and-forums-should-encourage-users-to-blog/">Social news sites and forums should encourage users to blog</a>.” Those who don’t stay on Reddit. The average Reddit contributor has little stake in long-term reputation—unlike bloggers, journalists, and academics who use real names—and that shows in the quality and quantity of posts. That may not hurt the site—the popularity of bad TV shows over many years demonstrates lowest-common denominator issues—but it should hurt in terms of high-quality users.</p>
<p>A form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">Gresham’s Law</a> applies to social sites and to moderators: bad commentary pushes out the good, and smart people flee stupid comments. One could alternately call this a <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Tragedy_of_the_commons.html">tragedy of the commons</a>, in which communal spaces become overrun with spam or commentary so stupid that it might as well be spam.</p>
<p>Reddit and similar sites can have an orthogonal problem, however, as they become so afraid of self-interested commentary or posts that they forbid it—thus causing smart people to go elsewhere with their thoughts, and leaving the dregs unwilling or able to create standalone communities or blogs.</p>
<p>This may be part of the reason why Reddit—even on the “good” subsections—tend to be better for beginners: anyone who gets past the beginning stages needs more expert advice than Redditors can provide. The same is happening to Hacker News, too, or it has already happened, though not as severely: Hacker News has an advantage in that its survival and the intelligent commentary on it is tied to a business that is in turn tied to ideas. Its moderators have a stronger incentive to get it right, since they’re not driven primarily by ego or overwhelming fear of “spam.”</p>
<p>That being said, anyone who has seen an unmoderated forum is aware of the fact that unmoderated forums are unusable. So getting rid of moderators is not a solution. In general the mechanisms of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Exit-Voice-Loyalty-Responses-Organizations/dp/0674276604;ref">exit, voice, and loyalty</a>, as described by Hirshman at the link, apply on the level of online communities. But constantly shifting for newer communities where smart people congregate is at best difficult and at worst a waste of time in and of itself. Reddit has to some extent worked on this problem through the sub-Reddit system, which is a better-than-nothing solution but not a great one.</p>
<p>Maybe there is no good solution to this from the perspective of smart users other than withdrawal. Better blogs written by smart individuals or groups are better than virtually any online, Reddit-like community I’ve found. Which is too bad. But I doubt most people in latter-day moderator positions are even willing or able to read this post, and, if they are, I don’t think they’ll understand it, and, if they do, I don’t think they’ll accept any of it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    <p>TL;DR
<a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown with Confluence</a></p>

<p>Oh man, I was so frustrated when I was trying to edit docs in Confluence, and it
broke all my text, trying to adjust any tags led to breaking the text even more.
I felt the same when Slack introduced their Wysiwyg editor that solved problems that never existed,
but at least they added an option to disable it.</p>
<p>Wysiwyg is the Devil’s Playground, but there is a solution.</p>
<p>Store with Git, write in Markdown, automatically sync with Confluence. Interesting? Let me tell you
about seven benefits that you could have if you could use Git for storing your docs instead of editing
them directly in Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Git</strong><br>
Confluence has a history of changes, but it’s very limited: you can’t do <code>git blame</code>,
you can’t do <code>git log -S</code> to search who added a specific text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pull Requests</strong><br>
Now, someone with a fresh set of eyes can identify problems and provide suggestions for docs.
You write code — someone reviews it, you write a book — someone reviews it.
Now, you write docs — someone reviews it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Instruments</strong><br>
We have some great tools like VSCode, Neovim, Sublime, or Idea with all required set of
extensions that make our coding even more efficient and less frustrating.</p>
<p>Then why not using it for writing docs? It’s more efficient than Wysiwyg for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No context switching</strong><br>
No need to jump around to read docs a bit. Just open it up in your editor
because you store the docs near to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hosting Agnostic</strong><br>
You can just push your docs on GitHub if you want to open source it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decentralization</strong><br>
Everyone has their own complete copy of docs, develops it, and syncs up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration</strong><br>
If you have a proper tool that I’m going to introduce, you can automatically update your docs in
Confluence after a successful <code>git push</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kovetskiy/mark">Mark — a tool for syncing your Markdown documentation with Atlassian Confluence</a></p>
<p>Mark reads your Markdown file, creates a Confluence page if it doesn’t, uploads
attachments if any, translates Markdown into HTML, and updates the contents of the page via REST API.</p>
<p>It’s like you don’t even need to create sections/pages in your Confluence anymore, just mention them in
your .md files.</p>
<p>Mark uses an extended file format, which, still being valid markdown, contains several HTML-ish
metadata headers, which can be used to locate page inside Confluence instance and update it
accordingly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: &lt;space key&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: &lt;parent 2&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: &lt;title&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 1&gt; --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: &lt;local path 2&gt; --&gt;</span>

Some text here.
</code></pre></div><h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><code>mark.md</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="markdown"><span>&lt;!-- Space: DEV --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Automation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Parent: Documentation --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Title: Sync Markdown to Confluence --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!-- Attachment: images/screenshot.png --&gt;</span>

Article text here.
![<span>screenshot</span>](<span>images/architecture.png</span>)
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ mark -u user -p password -b http://confluence/ -f mark.md
</code></pre></div><p>Mark will upload file <code>images/screenshot.png</code> as an attachment, create a page in Confluence by the
following path:<br>
<code>Dev / Automation / Documentation → Sync Markdown to Confluence</code>, then render
Markdown as HTML and put the contents via REST API on the user’s behalf.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>It’s quite trivial to integrate Mark into a CI/CD system, here is an example with <a href="https://snake-ci.com/">Snake CI</a>
in case of self-hosted Bitbucket Server / Data Center.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>stages</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span>- sync<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>Sync documentation</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>stage</span><span>:</span><span> </span>sync<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>only</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>branches</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>      </span>- main<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>image</span><span>:</span><span> </span>kovetskiy/mark<span>
</span><span>  </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span>- for<span> </span>file<span> </span>in<span> </span>$(find<span> </span>-type<span> </span>f<span> </span>-name<span> </span><span>'*.md'</span>);<span> </span>do<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo<span> </span><span>"&gt; Sync $file"</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>mark<span> </span>-u<span> </span>$MARK_USER<span> </span>-p<span> </span>$MARK_PASS<span> </span>-b<span> </span>$MARK_URL<span> </span>-f<span> </span>$file<span> </span>||<span> </span>exit<span> </span><span>1</span>;<span>
</span><span>        </span>echo;<span>
</span><span>      </span>done<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, I’m using the <code>kovetskiy/mark</code> image for creating a job container where the
repository with documentation will be cloned to. The following command finds all <code>*.md</code> files and runs mark against them one by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>for</span> file in <span>$(</span>find -type f -name <span>'*.md'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"&gt; Sync </span><span>$file</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
    mark -u <span>$MARK_USER</span> -p <span>$MARK_PASS</span> -b <span>$MARK_URL</span> -f <span>$file</span> <span>||</span> <span>exit</span> 1<span>;</span>
    echo<span>;</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The following directive tells the CI to run this particular job only if the changes are pushed into the
<code>main</code> branch. It means you can safely push your changes into feature branches without being afraid
that they automatically shown in Confluence, then go through the reviewal process and automatically
deploy them when PR got merged.</p>

Out of all the new things that came along with the release, one feature that stood apart was <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/machine-learning/ml-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnapML</a>.</p><p id="2991">SnapML allows lens creators to use their own custom machine learning models inside filters. Snapchat filters already use ML for a variety of things like face tracking, surface tracking, segmentation, facial gestures, and more.</p><p id="fef5">But with SnapML, developers can now go beyond those limits, using the breadth of their imaginations to combine custom ML models with Snapchat’s feature-rich augmented reality tools—and an audience of millions!</p><p id="49e5">Snapchat has made a lot of initial efforts to make the experience of implementing ML models as smooth and straightforward as possible. To do this, they’ve provided several ready-to-use templates that could be turned into AR experiences in only a few minutes. Let’s explore these templates and learn how to use them to create filters.</p><p id="a0a1">There are 5 main Lens Studio templates provided by Snap that cover some of the most common mobile machine learning tasks. We’ll cover the ML side of things a bit later, but first, here’s a look at the template projects inside Lens Studio:</p><h2 id="880d"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Style Transfer</strong></a></h2><p id="a9ab"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/style-transfer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Style transfer</a> is used to modify the overall visual appearance of the camera texture. Essentially, this task allows us to recompose the content of one image in the style of another.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*DNuj9eDDpeX3-grH.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="cc30">This could be used to create unique artistic styles or color filters. Imagine a selfie in the style of your favorite visual artists. This is similar to what we see in many image and video editing apps like <a href="https://prisma-ai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prisma</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looq-photo-video-filters/id1159704664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looq</a>.</p><p id="f688">This project template contains an example ML model with a style transfer visual effect. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom style transfer model.</p><h2 id="4439"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/classification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Classification</strong></a></h2><p id="5517">This template uses the <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image classification</a> ML technique, which is used to classify images into different labels. This task is also sometimes referred to as image labeling or image recognition.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg" width="500" height="250" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*pIT8wD2np_V_vSgr.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-recognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1a92">This could be used to tell, for example, whether user is wearing a hat or not in a given image or video frame. However, to create this kind of model, you’ll need to train it on a large dataset. There’s a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=image+classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety of image classification datasets out there</a>, but if there’s no dataset available for your use case, you’ll need to collect and label one.</p><p id="0e08">This template contains an example ML model that can tell if the user is wearing glasses or not, showing a particle effect if true. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom image classification model.</p><h2 id="f5e1"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Object Detection</strong></a></h2><p id="6f56">The <a href="https://www.fritz.ai/object-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object detection</a> template could be used to identify and locate one or more target objects in a given image or video frame. Object detection is somewhat similar to image classification, but it’s important to quickly distinguish the two:</p><ul><li id="138a">Image classification assigns a label to an image. A picture of a dog receives the label “dog”. A picture of two dogs, still receives the label “dog”</li><li id="d8b8">Object detection, on the other hand, draws what’s called a bounding box around each dog and labels the box “dog”. The model predicts where each object is and what label should be applied. In that way, object detection provides more information about an image than recognition.</li></ul><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg" width="400" height="400" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg 400w" sizes="400px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*_XrMzBf2PEBuQDiT.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="baea">In Lens Studio, you could use this template to identify the location of the ring finger in an image or video frame, and use that prediction to place an AR ring for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/mobile-machine-learning-in-e-commerce-and-retail-visual-search-ebook-sample-f6bfbd49e36c">virtual product try-ons</a>.</p><p id="8adb">Again, here you’ll need a large dataset of objects you want to detect—and their bounding box coordinates—to create a custom model for this effect. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=object+detection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here are some available datasets</a> to consider working with.</p><p id="f6ed">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes cars from the COCO dataset and draws bounding boxes around them. We’ll discuss in more detail below how to implement your own custom object detection model.</p><h2 id="6786"><a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/templates/ml/custom-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Custom Segmentation</strong></a></h2><p id="30fd"><a href="https://www.fritz.ai/image-segmentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Segmentation</a> is an ML technique used to differentiate between the specific parts or elements of an image. Specifically, it works at a pixel-level—the goal is to assign each pixel in an image to the object to which it belongs (i.e. class label).</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg" width="450" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg 450w" sizes="450px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5UYUFjBGvXs6lGcc.jpg?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="c28d">Segmentation could be used to add effects to a given segmented region. Snap Lense already had built-in segmentation to separate the user from the background, but with custom ML models you extend this task to anything you can think of—for example, segmenting the sky and changing it to into a beautiful, sunset-like pink-orange color.</p><p id="003c">This template contains an example ML model that recognizes a pizza and adds a sizzling effect to it.

You can also detect their location on the screen and when the feet touch each other.</li><li id="5738"><strong>Multi-Segmentation- </strong>whats’s better than segmentation? Multi-segmentation, this template allows you to segment more than 1 region on the image and add your texture/effect mask on it</li><li id="d06b"><strong>Eyebrow Addition/Removal- </strong>as the name suggests you could remove the user’s eyebrow or add a new silly one using this template</li><li id="aa79"><strong>Face Mask Classification and Segmentation- </strong>this template is super useful in context with the COVID-19 pandemic situation where wearing a face mask has become essential for safety. This template could detect if the user is wearing a face mask and will allow you to give the mask a custom style and texture.</li><li id="23a1"><strong>Beard Addition/Removal- </strong>just like the eyebrow template, this one will allow you to remove a person’s beard or add a new virtual one</li></ul><p id="6e46">All of the above Lens Studio templates include not just a pre-configured project in Lens Studio, but also resources for actually creating and implementing the specific ML Components (Lens Studio’s word for model files) in the given project.</p><p id="8510">To do this, Snap has provided <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter Notebooks</a> for each template that could be imported directly into <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Colab</a>. As such, they can all be tweaked easily to create a variety of effects—but if you're trying to create something unique and more specific, you’ll need to train your own custom machine learning model.</p><p id="590e">These Notebooks contain model training code and step-by-step instructions to create custom ML models for your own dataset. On running the code in these Notebooks, you will get a .onnx or .pb model file as output after the training is complete. You can then import this model as an ML Component into the Lens Studio project templates we discussed above.</p><blockquote><p id="40ed">To learn more on how ML models work in SnapML check <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/exploring-snapml-a-technical-overview-45d37114fe81">this high-level technical overview</a> by <a href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/@moellman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Moellman</a>.</p></blockquote><p id="43b2">Let’s take a look at what you need to provide as an input to each of these ML templates to get the desired model output:</p><ul><li id="e3b5"><strong>Style transfer:</strong> This is one is the simplest to accomplish, because you only need to provide a single style reference image and a test image (one is already provided for you upon download).

<p>I was trying to optimize a bash script and wondered how much echo statements would slow it down, so I did a few tests. I was specifically wondering if adding a check for verbosity before an echo statement would have a significant affect on runtime, vs just removing the echo statement all together.</p>

<p>I used this script to run the benchmark:

<p>I set <code>echo</code> to <code>01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789</code> when benchmarking for long echo statements, and to <code>foo</code> when benchmarking short echo statements.</p>

<p>The different options had significant differences in runtime. Checking for verbosity and not printing took an average of <code>1.5 - 1.7</code> times as long as not printing anything at all! I definitely took this into consideration when deciding which echo statements were really necessary for my bash script.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this benchmark is based on <code>echoing</code> to a file. By echoing to the console the options that print would take significantly longer.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any comments below!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h4><strong>Want to see some tried and tested color schemes?</strong> </h4><p>Here are the most popular websites by search traffic in the US for 2020 so far. We've pulled out the most dominant colors they use in their user interface. This is a result of their design teams iterating over time learning how to make the ideal experience for their users. A fun thing I love to do is browse through a website in the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> to see the iterations to their web design over time.</p><p>‍</p><p>With no further ado, let's dive in.</p><p>‍</p><h2>1. youtube.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,625,928,544</em></p><p>First up, we have YouTube. As the classic example of a user generated community, their use of a monochromatic color scheme allows their user content to stand out while the rest of the site's buttons dial back the stylistic features like extra chrome, button lines etc. The color red is used sparingly throughout the site experience to make their brand presence.</p><figure id="w-node-dd30d522abdd-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f0f3f346a77c079f50c_Youtube.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>2. en.wikipedia.org</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 1,032,257,682</em></p><p>Next, we have Wikipedia, our collective human hive mind. The most important UI here is the blue link that is the connective UI between all the pages. Our branched experience is guided by the contrast of the black and blue text. The subtle pastel colors are used to identify different types of information on a page.</p><figure id="w-node-f3e9626686b1-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f1c2797441bbf314858_Wikipedia.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>3. twitter.com</h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 535,672,329</em></p><p>Twitter's web design has changed a lot over the years. The 2020 design has minimalized to a simple color scheme that consists of a dominant blue used for main call to actions, and a beautiful set of bluish grays to create a hierarchy of text styles.</p><figure id="w-node-57f2c70343ff-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f26091a846f51452e16_Twitter.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. facebook.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 512,517,207</em></p><p>Compared to Twitter, Facebook's color scheme is a bit more complex. It involves many more notifications and vibrant colors taking you from one corner of the UI to the next. It's surprising that Facebook hasn't mimicked more of Youtube's philosophy especially since they too rely on a lot of photography and user generated content.</p><figure id="w-node-d68aa9f10aad-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f313f346a777379f62c_Facebook.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>5. amazon.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 492,468,801</em></p><p>Amazon's web design is heavily anchored by the dark navigation bar with the search box. Since their shopping experience relies on intent to buy, reminding shoppers where to search and how accessible it is is very important for them. Light blues and yellows are used to accent the large boxes of white and bring attention to prime branding and other special deals.</p><figure id="w-node-f1131ed9d6fa-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f3f2a3bf07561ef0472_Amazon.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>6. yelp.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 189,284,057</em></p><p>Yelp's design is similar to Youtube. The wide use of whitespace makes way for the vibrant reds and blues to get the visitor's attention.</p><figure id="w-node-06063004e617-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f477532a80b1402e7de_Yelp.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. reddit.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 184,283,420</em></p><p>Reddit is a special one on this list. Since the value of Reddit is that anyone can customize a subreddit to their audience's liking, there is no universal color scheme for Reddit. On the homepage, it resorts to using bluish light grays and white to mark the community board layout.</p><figure id="w-node-bb013a4696fe-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f509fc4fe62dde19dcc_Reddit.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>8. imdb.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,686,113</em></p><p>Much like Amazon, IMDB relies on the search for its core experience. A darker color scheme is used all around the website to remind users of the movie going experience. Movie pages have a lighter appearance to give more attention to the blue text links and images.</p><figure id="w-node-af213f7b67ec-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f609508d3d4ce412e39_IMDB.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. fandom.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 168,358,254</em></p><p>Of all the websites on this list, Fandom definitely wins the title for most unique set of colors. While teal feels like the brand's most dominant color, the darker teals and bright neon green does a great job in supporting the composition.</p><figure id="w-node-2e0cffbe6628-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f6ad8a527e60c7b240d_Fandom.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. pinterest.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 160,008,934</em></p><p>Such a friendly set of colors. Although their user interface sets the expectation for a minimal set of colors like YouTube, they seem to be using muted versions of green, blue and yellow to give the website a splash of vibrancy,</p><figure id="w-node-3df77482884d-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7347b1322743ea9d15_Pinterest.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. tripadvisor.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 107,547,225</em></p><p>Tripadvisor uses the very unique set of light neon colors, marking them separately from the other travel websites. Although the colors by itself can feel jarring in how bright it is, when paired together, the combination seems to work. To balance the eccentric color scheme, the color black is used for the input elements like textboxes and buttons.</p><figure id="w-node-9c75faa2153f-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f7a915325c29b2bcbf8_Tripadvisor.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>12. instagram.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 95,560,034</em></p><p>Instagram takes a page out of YouTube's brand color scheme. To highlight the photographs taken by Instagram users, the user interface uses black and white elements to blend it into the background. The primary colors like blue is reserved for buttons and the range of yellow to pink for their popular stories feature.</p><figure id="w-node-a3e998655c01-8b48bcde"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ac26aa260db49e86f48bcdc/5f0e5f8366a20f0036a1f59c_Instagram.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>13. walmart.com<br></h2><p><em>Monthly traffic: 94,951,789</em></p><p>As opposed to Amazon, Walmart uses bold colors to highlight specials in a carousel layout. This prioritizes the curated products over the grid on the homepage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			




<p>Scrypt is a slow-by-design <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash function</a> or more accurately, a <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">KDF</a> function. Its purpose is to take some input data, and create a fingerprint of that data, but to do it very slowly. A common use-case is to take a password and create an n-bit private key, which is much longer and more secure. Here at <a href="https://classroom.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">Qvault</a> we use a similar KDF for securing user passwords.</p>



<p>For example, let’s pretend your password is password1234. By using Scrypt, we can extend that deterministically into a 256-bit key:</p>



<p><strong>password1234 </strong>-&gt; <br>AwEEDA4HCwQFAA8DAwwHDQwPDwUOBwoOCQACAgUJBQ0JAAYNBAMCDQ4JCQgLDwcGDQMDDgMKAQsNBAkLAwsACA==</p>



<p>That long 256-bit key can now be used as a private key to encrypt and decrypt data. For example, it could be the key in an <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> cipher.</p>



<h2><span id="Why_not_use_the_password_to_encrypt_directly">Why not use the password to encrypt directly?</span>
</h2>



<p>Most encryption algorithms, including AES-256, require that a key of sufficient length is used. By hashing the password, we can derive a longer, more secure, fixed-size key.</p>



<p>Furthermore, using a KDF like Scrypt provides additional benefits over a traditional hash function like <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/07/08/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Computationally expensive and slow</li>
<li>Memory intensive (potentially several gigabytes of RAM is used to execute the hash)</li>
</ul>
<p>Often times <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/02/11/how-do-brute-force-attackers-know-they-found-the-key/">brute-force attackers</a> will try to break encryption by guessing passwords over and over until they get it right. <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/02/very-basic-intro-to-aes-256-cipher/">AES-256</a> and SHA-2 are fast, so an attacker would be able to guess many passwords per second. By using a slow hashing function like Scrypt to derive a key, we can force the attacker to waste more resources trying to break in.</p>



<h2><span id="Scrypt_Step-by-Step">Scrypt Step-by-Step</span>
</h2>



<p>Scrypt can be visualized by some psuedo-code:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	// we'll get to theis
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s go through the steps of converting those inputs into the desired <code>derivedKey</code></p>



<h3><span id="1_-_Define_Blocksize">1 – Define Blocksize</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor</code></pre>



<h3><span id="2_-_Generate_Initial_Salt">2 – Generate Initial Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Scrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> as a child key-derivation function. We use it to generate an initial salt. PBKDF2 has the following signature:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func PBKDF2(
	prf,
	password,
	salt,
	numIterations,
	desiredKeyLen
) derivedKey {}</code></pre>



<p>We use it as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="3_-_Mix_Salt">3 – Mix Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Next, we mix the salt. We split <code>initialSalt</code> into <code>splitSalt</code>, which is a 2D array of bytes. Each sub-array contains 1024 bytes</p>



<pre><code lang="go">splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
for i, block := range splitSalt {
	newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
	splitSalt[i] = newBlock
}</code></pre>



<p>where <code>roMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func roMix(block, iterations){
	v := []
	x := block
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		v[i] = x
		x = blockMix(x)
	}
	for i := 0; i &lt; iterations; i++ {
		j := integerify(x) % iterations
		x = blockMix(x ^ v[j])
	}
	return x
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>integerify</code> is defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7914">RFC-7914</a> and <code>blockMix</code> is:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func blockMix(block){
	r := len(block) / 128
	// split block into an array of 2r 64-byte chunks
	chunks := get2r64ByteChunks()

	x := chunks[len(chunks)-1]
	y := []
	for i := 0; i &lt; len(chunks); i++{
		x = salsa20-8(x ^ chunks[i])
		y[i] = x
	}
	return [y[0], y[2], ...y[2r-2], y[1], y[3], ...y[2r-1]]
}</code></pre>



<p>Where <code>salsa20-8</code> is the 8-round version of the algorithm defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">here</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="4_-_Finalize_Salt">4 – Finalize Salt</span>
</h3>



<p>Now <code>splitSalt</code> has been mixed in such a computationally exhausting way that we will call it an <code>expensiveSalt</code>. Expensive salt will be a single array of bytes, so we need to concatenate all the subarrays in <code>splitSalt</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="go">expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)</code></pre>



<h3><span id="5_-_Return_Final_KDF">5 – Return Final KDF</span>
</h3>



<pre><code lang="go">return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)</code></pre>



<p>The final pseudocode for our top level function is as follows:</p>



<pre><code lang="go">func Scrypt(
	passphrase, // string of characters to be hashed
	salt,  // random salt
	costFactor, // CPU/Memory cost, must be power of 2
	blockSizeFactor,
	parallelizationFactor, // (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
	desiredKeyLen // Desired key length in bytes
) derivedKey {
	const blockSize = 128 * blockSizeFactor

	const initialSalt = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, salt, 1, blockSize * parallelizationFactor)

	splitSalt := [][1024]byte(initialSalt)
	for i, block := range splitSalt {
		newBlock := roMix(block, costFactor)
		splitSalt[i] = newBlock
	}

	expensiveSalt := append([], splitSalt...)

	return PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA256, passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, desiredKeyLen)
}</code></pre>



<p>Or, if you prefer, the pseudocode as defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">Wikipedia</a>:</p>



<pre><code lang="">Function scrypt
   Inputs:
      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed
      Salt:                      Bytes    random salt
      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter - Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)
      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter (8 is commonly used)
      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1..232-1 * hLen/MFlen)
      DesiredKeyLen:             Integer  Desired key length in bytes
   Output:
      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long

   Step 1. Generate expensive salt
   blockSize ← 128*BlockSizeFactor  //Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8 = 1024 bytes)

   Use PBKDF2 to generate initial 128*BlockSizeFactor*p bytes of data (e.g. 128*8*3 = 3072 bytes)
   Treat the result as an array of p elements, each entry being blocksize bytes (e.g. 3 elements, each 1024 bytes)
   [B0...Bp−1] ← PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, Salt, 1, blockSize*ParallelizationFactor)

   Mix each block in B Costfactor times using ROMix function (each block can be mixed in parallel)
   for i ← 0 to p-1 do
      Bi ← ROMix(Bi, CostFactor)

   All the elements of B is our new "expensive" salt
   expensiveSalt ← B0∥B1∥B2∥ ... ∥Bp-1  //where ∥ is concatenation
 
   Step 2. Use PBKDF2 to generate the desired number of bytes, but using the expensive salt we just generated
   return PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256(Passphrase, expensiveSalt, 1, DesiredKeyLen);</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the past we have <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-02-03-mapping-income-inequality-using-irs-soi-data/">blogged</a> about the IRS Sources of Income (SOI) data that we harvested and published as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/irs-soi/data/master">Dolt database</a>. We presented a compelling visualization that was relatively straightforward to create using that database. It was straightforward to create because of the work that went into transforming disparate and unruly files to a coherently presented database. Recently we <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">highlighted</a> a dataset of USPS Crosswalk mappings that are widely used into academic and commercial settings to traverse between ZIP code and other geographic statistical entities, for example counties. They are also available as a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-13-usps-crosswalk-database-on-dolthub/">Dolt database</a>. Finally just today we published US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/census-population-estimates">population estimates</a> by county, indexed on FIPS code going back to 2010.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive features of using Dolt and DoltHub together is how elegant they make acquiring these datasets in your local environment. There is no need to sign up, and we aren't tying you to a compute environment we will try and charge you for. They simply enable distribution of datasets along with a SQL interface. Dolt runs wherever you need it to run. Users can skip downloading, parsing, and cleaning collections of files, and begin analyzing the data immediately.</p>
<p>In this post we show how these features make it easy to combine a specifically interesting dataset, the IRS SOI data, with generally useful datasets, the USPS Crosswalk data and county level population estimates, to essentially toggle the spatial resolution of the IRS data. We conclude by advocating for the concept of a data dependency delivered as a "drop in" resource. The benefit of this model is for companies and individuals that depend on data, but do not see at as a core competency, to focus on what they do best. This is very much how open source software works.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>To work through this locally you will need to get a copy of Dolt, which on <code>*nix</code> systems can be done with a single command, and we have documentation on the full range of installation options <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/docs/tutorials/installation/#dolt">here</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ sudo bash -c 'curl -L https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash'</code></pre></div>
<p>For the analysis component, you will need Doltpy, which has all other libraries imported in the sample code as a dependency. It's available on PyPi:</p>

<p>For the visualization you will need several Python libraries, but they can easily be installed as follows:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>pip install plotly plotly-geo geopandas==0.3.0  pyshp==1.2.10</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's move onto to acquiring data.</p>
<h2>Acquiring data</h2>
<p>Acquiring data with Dolt is easy. Let's set up a home for our analysis:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ mkdir -p ~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs &amp;&amp; cd irs-analysis/dolt-dbs
$ dolt clone Liquidata/irs-soi
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/irs-soi
291,637 of 291,637 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$ dolt clone Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/usps-crosswalk-data
210,458 of 210,458 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.
$  dolt clone Liquidata/census-population-estimates
cloning https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/Liquidata/census-population-estimates
82 of 82 chunks complete. 0 chunks being downloaded currently.</code></pre></div>
<p>We now have two Dolt databases in <code>~/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs</code>, and we can launch the Dolt SQL shell in with the <code>--multi-db-dir</code> switch to make load them both into our SQL environment:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ ls -ltr
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  12 oscarbatori  staff  384 Jul 23 18:07 irs-soi
drwxr-xr-x   6 oscarbatori  staff  192 Jul 23 21:11 usps-crosswalk-data
$ dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
~/Documents/irs-analysis/dolt-dbs|&gt;&gt;  dolt sql --multi-db-dir .
# Welcome to the DoltSQL shell.
# Statements must be terminated with ';'.
# "exit" or "quit" (or Ctrl-D) to exit.
&gt; show databases;
+-----------------------------+
| Database                    |

| information_schema          |
| irs_soi                     |
| usps_crosswalk_data         |
+-----------------------------+</code></pre></div>
<p>We have now acquired two datasets, both maintained by DoltHub. We can use <code>dolt pull</code> to subscribe to changes to the datasets, making any derivative analysis we create "live."</p>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>We will be working with adjusted gross income by ZIP code, and then using the USPS Crosswalk data and county population estiamtes to translate that to county level per capita income. This works because the USPS publishes mappings from ZIP codes to various geographical statistical entities identified by FIPS code, mappings that we completely capture (across time and mapping pairs). The data includes "ratios" of residential and business addresses for pairings that are not one to one. For example a ZIP code and straddle county lines, and vice versa, and so these ratios provide a mechanism for us approximate how much of a given aggregate to apportion when we perform the mapping.</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at the data to see how it looks in practice:</p>

<p>We can see here a bunch of ZIP codes that are completely contained within counties. These ZIP codes contain only business addresses. That's not always the cade. Let's step into Python and do some analysis.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>We saw earlier how easy it was to acquire the data from DoltHub using Dolt. The USPS Crosswalk dataset took around 450 files to build, each of them Excel files. So running a single command was a pretty big time saving, even over the narrow subset of the data we are interested in, around 50 files. Loading them into Dolt also required removing some corrupt data, so that work is now embedded in the database, and amortized over everyone that takes advantage of it.</p>
<p>This simple acquisition model is only fraction of the benefit of acquiring data via Dolt and DoltHub. The balance comes from the SQL interface that arrives with the data. We don't need to parse files, we can just use SQL's elegant declarative syntax to describe the data we are interested in, and then let the query engine deliver it to our preferred interface, in this case Python.</p>
<p>The goal of our analysis is to translate ZIP code level income data to the county level, so let's grab each dataset, and then combine them:</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/topsecret.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>**Name Redacted**, Captain Nadav Lev, and **Name Redacted**</figcaption></figure>







<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<p>One of the most fundamental reasons why I believe that the value of Bitcoin will continue to appreciate is because it is much easier for people to start believing in it than it is for people to stop.</p>



<p>Bitcoin believers tend to believe in it strongly and sometimes even irrationally. For many people, it is like a religion. For many more, Bitcoin has a continuous influence on their way of life not dissimilar to other modern systems of belief such as climate change and veganism. To varying degrees, Bitcoin believers will weather potentially any storm (decreases in its value, attacks in the media, etc.). Qualitatively, Bitcoin believers are quite strong.</p>



<p>Quantitatively, outside of Bitcoin’s still relatively small base of believers, there are many more people who do not sufficiently understand Bitcoin than there are people who do understand it but do not believe in it. If the last decade is any indication, a certain and probably high percentage of those who do not yet understand Bitcoin will quickly and easily come to believe in it once they do.</p>



<p>Having observed these dynamics of the Bitcoin belief system, I am near certain that non-owners are coming to believe in Bitcoin faster than owners are losing their belief. In other words, the outside population is buying into Bitcoin faster than than the inside population is selling out. This trend seems poised to continue indefinitely. As long as it does, so will the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value due to the increasing demand for the limited and finite supply.</p>



<p>One can think of Bitcoin as having a natural network effect where the owner population is expanding exponentially in comparison with an extremely low churn rate among its existing owners. It is this sort of network effect that has given rise to the most valuable companies of our time. Bitcoin is not a company but it stands to benefit just the same.</p>



<p>Quants can do all the fancy analysis they want but the simple fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is worth nothing without people’s belief in it. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, its value will plummet. If more people start believing in Bitcoin, its value will continue to appreciate. Because Bitcoin’s value is sustained solely by people’s belief in it, it seems to me that any prudent investor who makes a bullish case for Bitcoin should seek to support this most basic underlying assumption which says that the overall belief in Bitcoin is growing and will continue to grow. That is the assumption which I have sought to support with this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In closing, it is worth stating clearly that money has no real value other than that which people believe it does. As long as people believe Bitcoin is valuable, it will be. Today it seems evident that Bitcoin believers are quickly accumulating and scarcely abandoning the asset. So long as this continues to be the case, and it seems more probable that not that it will, Bitcoin’s value will rise.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Computers are cold and heartless. They don't lie, and they don't care if you scream and swear at them. You can abuse them all day long, and they'll still efficiently flip bits and push pixels.</p><p>But... people aren't. Behind every piece of software, there's at least one human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams, and fears. Who feels.</p><p>This is something I've been wanting to write in one form or another for quite a while now, and I've been rewriting this post for a little too long.</p><p>Sometimes it seems like we forget about the humans. Either we forget that there's a human behind the software we build, or we forget that we're shipping software <em>for people</em>. </p><p>It seems to me that more and more, especially recently, nobody can share their work or their ideas without someone stepping in and criticising their ideas. Maybe they could have written it in a language that's faster, uses less memory, <em>something about bloat or native code.</em> Maybe it doesn't have a feature that another project does, so why the hell should anyone use it? &nbsp;</p><p>I remember earlier in my career, every time I opened a PR, I'd have a small feeling of anxiety. Was it good enough? What if I'm bad at programming? Would people hate it? What if I'm wrong? Fear of failure is one of the biggest obstacles to success, and all too often it stops people from sharing or achieving what they could. The feeling of "this isn't good enough to share" goes along with that.</p><p>Even while writing this, I couldn't help but feel like it isn't quite perfect, isn't quite good enough to share. But that's the point of my blog; I want to make myself put things out there, even if they're not 100%. </p><p>We should feel like it's ok to share work that isn't finished, that doesn't use the fastest, cleanest, most optimal approach. If I've made something for fun and want to share it, why not? If it doesn't use the technology you prefer, and you haven't paid me to build it, why would you shit all over someone else's work?</p><p>Better yet. If you care that much, make your own. Instead of pulling down something of someone else's', build your own thing up.</p><p>To some degree I understand people not being satisfied with professional software, that they have paid for, and that doesn't meet their expectations. But if it's open source, free, and available for all? Why would you ever complain about that? If it's not for you, just... move on.</p><p>Friends of mine won't share their blog posts to HN, Reddit, etc, because they feel like their words aren't good enough. Or like people there are going to tear them apart. Or because they might have made a small mistake somewhere.</p><p>The main thing I can see fuelling so many arguments is an inherent <em>need</em> to be right. It's been written about so many times before, but for some reason people can't bear the idea that <strong><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">someone on the internet is wrong</a></strong>. </p><p>Except, when it comes to the preferences of which tools or technology someone wants to build something with, in their own time, can you really be wrong? </p><p>There's a stereotype held about people in tech, that we're all that super nerdy person who struggles socially, can't talk to people, and hide all day in the basement programming. And that somehow, this is excusable if you're <em>really good </em>at writing code. But is it? If you're writing code for people to use, and you're working on it with people, not having people skills isn't really an option. Much like technical skills, it isn't an innate quality - you can work on improving your people skills, much like you can your tech skills.</p><p>If you take anything at all from my post, hopefully it's this; if you really must say something, and you really feel like someone made the wrong choice, maybe think about your phrasing. Eg</p><blockquote>Hey! Nice work. I was curious though, why'd you pick &lt;tech&gt; over &lt;other tech&gt;?</blockquote><p>vs</p><blockquote>Ugh, this would be so much better if it just used &lt;tech&gt;. I hate the way modern tech is going</blockquote><p>Let's make our industry a much more friendly and welcoming place 💖</p>

    <p>(Live thread, will be updated with new visuals and polish over the next few days. Join <a href="http://eepurl.com/gl0BHL">the mailing list</a> to get updated when completed)</p>

<p>A trained language model generates text.</p>

<p>We can optionally pass it some text as input, which influences its output.</p>

<p>The output is generated from what the model “learned” during its training period where it scanned vast amounts of text.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/01-gpt3-language-model-overview.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Training is the process of exposing the model to lots of text. That process has been completed. All the experiments you see now are from that one trained model. It was estimated to cost 355 GPU years and cost $4.6m.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/02-gpt3-training-language-model.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The dataset of 300 billion tokens of text is used to generate training examples for the model. For example, these are three training examples generated from the one sentence at the top.</p>

<p>You can see how you can slide a window across all the text and make lots of examples.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-training-examples-sliding-window.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The model is presented with an example. We only show it the features and ask it to predict the next word.</p>

<p>The model’s prediction will be wrong. We calculate the error in its prediction and update the model so next time it makes a better prediction.</p>

<p>Repeat millions of times</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/03-gpt3-training-step-back-prop.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Now let’s look at these same steps with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>GPT3 actually generates output one token at a time (let’s assume a token is a word for now).</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/04-gpt3-generate-tokens-output.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Please note: This is a description of how GPT-3 works and not a discussion of what is novel about it (which is mainly the ridiculously large scale). The architecture is a transformer decoder model based on this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.10198.pdf</p>

<p>GPT3 is MASSIVE. It encodes what it learns from training in 175 billion numbers (called parameters). These numbers are used to calculate which token to generate at each run.</p>

<p>The untrained model starts with random parameters. Training finds values that lead to better predictions.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/gpt3-parameters-weights.png">
  <br>

</p>

<p>These numbers are part of hundreds of matrices inside the model. Prediction is mostly a lot of matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mSTCzNgDJy4">Intro to AI on YouTube</a>, I showed a simple ML model with one parameter. A good start to unpack this 175B monstrosity.</p>

<p>To shed light on how these parameters are distributed and used, we’ll need to open the model and look inside.</p>

<p>GPT3 is 2048 tokens wide. That is its “context window”. That means it has 2048 tracks along which tokens are processed.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/05-gpt3-generate-output-context-window.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>Let’s follow the purple track. How does a system process the word “robotics” and produce “A”?</p>

<p>High-level steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the word to <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/">a vector (list of numbers) representing the word</a></li>
  <li>Compute prediction</li>
  <li>Convert resulting vector to word</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/06-gpt3-embedding.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>The important calculations of the GPT3 occur inside its stack of 96 transformer decoder layers.</p>

<p>See all these layers? This is the “depth” in “deep learning”.</p>

<p>Each of these layers has its own 1.8B parameter to make its calculations. That is where the “magic” happens. This is a high-level view of that process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/07-gpt3-processing-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>You can see a detailed explanation of everything inside the decoder in my blog post <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT2</a>.</p>

<p>The difference with GPT3 is the alternating dense and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10509.pdf">sparse self-attention layers</a>.</p>

<p>This is an X-ray of an input and response (“Okay human”) within GPT3. Notice how every token flows through the entire layer stack. We don’t care about the output of the first words. When the input is done, we start caring about the output. We feed every word back into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/08-gpt3-tokens-transformer-blocks.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>In the React code generation example (https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1284421499915403264), the description would be the input prompt (in green), in addition to a couple of examples of description=&gt;code, I believe. And the react code would be generated like the pink tokens here token after token.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the priming examples and the description are appended as input, with specific tokens separating examples and the results. Then fed into the model.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/09-gpt3-generating-react-code-example.gif">
  <br>

</p>

<p>It’s impressive that this works like this. Because you just wait until fine-tuning is rolled out for the GPT3. The possibilities will be even more amazing.</p>

<p>Fine-tuning actually updates the model’s weights to make the model better at a certain task.</p>

<p><img src="https://jalammar.github.io/images/gpt3/10-gpt3-fine-tuning.gif">
  <br>

				<p>Streaming services offered by companies like Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Co are getting more and more popular. Millions of subscribers stream countless hours of movies and tv series every month. Subscriber get access to a large media library for a monthly fee (subscription).</p><hr><h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2><p>Netflix and similar streaming services can only earn money as long as they can deliver new content.</p><hr><p>Netflix is the king of streaming. The company perfects the streaming business with nearly <a href="https://www.netflixinvestor.com/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">193 million paying subscribers at the end of Q2 2020</a>.</p><p>The share price of Netflix reflect its success:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png" alt="" srcset="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 600w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 1000w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 1600w, https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Netflix-Share-Price.png 2150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Netflix share price. Screenshot taken at Jul 21, 2020. <a href="https://www.netflixinvestor.com/stock-information/stock-chart/default.aspx">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Even during one of the worst modern pandemic, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, Netflix' share price just knows one direction: Upwards. Streaming is undoubtedly the future of entertainment.</p><p>But there is one problem — the problem I refer to as <strong>The Entertainment Loop</strong>. To understand the problem, we have to understand how Netflix (and similar services) make money. It's actually fairly simple.</p><h2 id="how-making-money-works-in-the-21st-century">How Making Money Works in the 21st Century</h2><p>In just one single word: Subscription. For a small monthly fee you, as a company, provide a good service to your customer. This has two main advantages over the old school "pay once and get something" sales tactic:</p><ol><li>Due to the relatively small fee you are able to reach a large customer audience in comparison to a high (one-time)-fee.</li><li>If you, as a company, are able to successfully bind the paying customer to your service, the monthly compounding fee outgrows the large "one-time-fee" that you could've charged instead.</li></ol><p>It is important to understand these two advantages and why companies decide for a monthly subscription business instead of a one-time-fee business. There are additional advantages in the subscription-based model, but we'll keep it simple for now.</p><p>These two advantages are the key to Netflix success. That's the good (probably awesome) part of the story. But here comes the story: These two advantages <strong>will cause damage </strong>to your company in the future.</p><p>To understand why, we'll have to understand, how Netflix makes money.</p><h2 id="how-netflix-makes-money">How Netflix Makes Money</h2><p>Netflix makes money by selling monthly subscriptions in exchange for unlimited movies and tv &nbsp;on their platform. That's it. It's that simple.</p><p>Let's think about the service in exchange for the monthly fee, to understand the problem: Unlimited streaming of movies and tv series.</p><p>Netflix main goal is to make the user stay and keep paying. For reach that ultimate goal, Netflix has to deliver value to the user. Every month — or he will leave and stop paying the monthly fee. That's why Netflix has to keep pushing new content for every users' own (movie-)taste. Once the user doesn't receive any new value from Netflix, he will stop paying for the service. And Netflix only way to provide value is to deliver movies and tv-series.</p><p>I'm pretty sure that you understood this, but let me try to clarify (and simplify) it with a flow chart:</p><figure><img src="https://jdstaerk.de/content/images/2020/07/Entertainment-Loop-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>Broken down to one line: <strong>Netflix will not earn any money, if they don't add new content.</strong></p><h2 id="how-netflix-can-solve-this-problem-and-why-it-isn-t-easy">How Netflix can solve this problem and why it isn't easy</h2><p>Netflix can solve this problem by adding new content (surprise!). But they will encounter a second problem, if they keep adding content: Costs.</p><p>Let's think it through. The loop goes like this:</p><ol><li>Netflix adds content</li><li>Costs increase</li><li>New (paying) subscribers join because of the new content</li><li>Existing subscribers are happy and keep paying</li><li>Newly added content gets old and boring</li><li>Less new (paying) subscribers</li><li>Existing subscribers get bored and start leaving</li><li>Netflix has to add new content</li><li>Go to #1</li></ol><p>That is the Entertainment Loop. And it is nearly impossible to break out of it.</p><p>And this is just the start of the problem. The key here is, that Netflix has to add more and more new content to make existing customers happy. But they not only need the existing customers, they will need new customers to cover the increasing costs. And the costs will increase because, you might already guess it, Netflix has to deliver value (content) to the existing customers to make them stay (and keep them happy).</p><p>But the number of new (paying) subscribers isn't increasing from month to month. It will flatten in decline. Reason for that is, that the number of potential new customers is finite. There are not (!) unlimited new possible subscriber.</p><p>The real trouble starts once Netflix approaches the limit of adding new subscribers. New and fresh money stops floating in like the year before, but the expectations for new value (new content) of the existing customers is not declining — it is staying at least the same or the expectation will even increase.</p><p>So Netflix will have to deliver even more new value in form of content like movies and tv series. And that increases the costs — again. And now Netflix is in a situation, where the costs keep increasing (or staying the same) but the money they earn from paying subscribers will not increase that much. And that is the Entertainment Loop.</p><h2 id="first-counterargument-against-this">First counterargument against this</h2><p>Actually, do the costs keep increasing? You might deny this question. Each month, Netflix need more or less the same amount of new movies and tv series to keep the subscribers happy and paying. So the costs stay more or less the same, don't they? The answer is yes... but actually, no.</p><p>The costs keep increasing. And that's why:</p><p>First of, the expectations for new content keeps increasing. That makes the production more expensive.</p><p>Second, Netflix' new subscribes are not <em>mainstream</em> subscribers. The "normal" subscriber who likes mainstream movies and tv series has already subscribed to Netflix. Netflix gains more and more subscribers who want to the <em>non-mainstream</em> content. That keeps increasing the costs as Netflix has to produce more and more of the <em>non-mainstream </em>content.</p><p>That keeps the costs increasing.</p><p>Of course, if a new subscriber joins, he'll be happy for some time, because he can watch all the content that Netflix added over the time when he wasn't a subscriber. But at some point, he'll run out of existing content to consume. Then Netflix has to deliver new content, to keep him happy and subscribing.</p><h2 id="second-counterargument-against-this">Second counterargument against this</h2><p>Netflix could just increase its prices for a subscription step by step. Increasing the costs, by, let's say 10%, would increase Netflix revenue immediately. And a 10% price increase wouldn't hurt the user.</p><p>Problem with that is, that Netflix cannot create a monopoly. Unlike famous companies like Apple, anyone could build a streaming business. The technology is fairly simple (I mean, it is very complicated, but if you hire a lot of good software engineers and product managers, it would be possible to create a streaming service like Netflix has). And it is very hard to bind users to the value Netflix delivers: Movies and tv series. Of course, there will be some people who want to see the next season of a Netflix Original. But different producers could also create a tv series which binds users to it. In addition, it isn't very profitable for a company to produce a large number of seasons for a tv series.</p><p>That's because every additional season of a tv series costs more money to a company than the previous one. Why? Because who wants to see the following season? Only the people who also watch the previous one. Or did you ever said "damn, I really want to see season 5 of the show x", without having watched season 1 to 4 of show x? Producing a new season of a tv series will not make a company more money than the previous one. That's why it is incredible hard to bind users to a movie/tv-series business. Creating good content is interchangeable.</p><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>This entertainment loop happens to every movie subscription company.

					<p>#Noise #pollution is one of the main stressors in urban environments, having negative impacts on people’s quality of life and health. For some groups of citizens, such as school children, patients, and elders, there is a need to support them in finding pedestrian routes in noise polluted areas of cities. In<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139350" target="_blank"> a new paper</a>, <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">we</a> focus on the <strong>estimation of traffic noise</strong>, and present an approach to <strong>provide quiet routing services</strong>, <em>taking into account the estimated noise levels of roads</em>.</p>
<p>By combining Volunteered Geographic Information from OpenStreetMap (OSM), official socio-economic data, and open-access GPS trajectory data, we develop a set of traffic related variables, and apply machine learning methods to perform<strong> traffic volume estimations</strong>. Given the estimated traffic information, an existing traffic noise model is then employed to derive the noise polluted areas. For generation of quiet routes, a new routing algorithm is proposed. It minimizes the exposure of pedestrians to traffic noise pollution while taking into account the route distance constraint. We apply our quiet routing approach to the city of Heidelberg (Germany). The application results demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms in the generation of quiet routes customized to pedestrian preferences.</p>

<p>In earlier work we looked already into generating customized pleasant pedestrian routes based on several factors like greenness, noise and sociability, and added this to <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/" target="_blank">Openrouteservice</a> by <a href="http://heigit.org/" target="_blank">HeiGIT</a> &amp; <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">GIScience HD</a>:</p>

<p>Also currently we started to <a href="http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2020/06/19/going-green-with-meingrun-today-app-launch-in-heidelberg-and-dresden/">test related approaches in Dresden and Heidelberg</a> in the context of the <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/gis/meingruen_en.html" target="_blank">meinGrün</a> project.<br>
This builds upon early work by <a href="https://www.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/md/chemgeo/geog/gis/arcviewbuch-zipf-roether.pdf" target="_blank">Zipf and Röther (2000)</a>, But nowadays the needed data sources are much more available, so that it becomes possible to scale these ideas to new levels using open data which allow to finetune and evaluate the approach using real world data.</p>
<p>The relevance of green spaces for wellbeing and mental health in cities has been proofed by a study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0451-y" target="_blank">Nature Neuroscience</a></p>

Hardly anybody I know of reads the physical newspaper – in fact the only people I know of are my parents and grandparents. What do the others do? The others open one of the news websites to stay updated with what’s happening. There may be many of us though, who don’t have a fixed website we like to read our news on, and generally open whichever we come across first. Have we ever stopped to think how much the news sites track readers?</p> <h2>Premise</h2><p>With the latest update of Snap Search, we’re now blocking more ads, trackers and analytics than ever before. To test the efficiency, we decided to try various news websites and see how these sites track readers.</p><p>To keep the competition fair, we picked 1 topic which all of them had written about – in this case about TV reporter Victoria Price who was diagnosed with cancer after a viewer emailed her to get a lump on her throat checked.</p><h2>Rules</h2><ol><li>The following list is not in any

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	If there was any hope that a global pandemic would help slow down Toronto's booming housing market this new listing proves that’s not the case.</p>
<p>
	A tiny two-bedroom, one bathroom home on Euclid Street in Little Italy has just hit the market for $999,999.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The "rare detached bungalow located in the heart of Toronto" is advertised as being a "great size" with "loads of potential."</p>

<p>
	Property taxes on the home will set you back $5,307 per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to a report from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board earlier this month, home sales in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) are rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and prices are on the rise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	The real estate board said there were 8,701 homes sold in June, down 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year.</p>
<p>
	On a seasonally adjusted basis, sales in June were up 84 per cent compared with May.</p>
<p>
	The average selling price in the GTA was $930,869, up 11.9 per cent compared with June 2019.</p>

  <p><span>27 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Data produced by programs need to be stored somewhere for future reference, and
there must be some sort of organisation so we can quickly retrieve the desired
information. A file system (FS) is responsible for this task and provides an
abstraction over the storage devices where the data is physically stored.</p>

<p>In this post, we will learn more about the concepts used by file systems, and
how they fit together when writing your own.</p>

<h2 id="structuring-the-disk">Structuring the disk</h2>
<p>When data is stored in a hard-disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD), it is
written in small units called sectors (or pages in the SSD case). The drives
don’t have any information about what that piece of data represents, for all it
is worth, the disk is just a giant array of sectors. It is the job of the file
system to make sense of it all.</p>

<p>A file system will divide the disk into fixed-sized blocks. The FS uses the
majority of these blocks to store user data, but some blocks are used to store
metadata that is essential for the file system operation.</p>

<p>The following figure gives an example of how a file system structures the
information on the disk:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_filesystem_blocks.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>File system structure in a disk</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the next sections, we will understand what each type of block means.</p>

<h3 id="superblock-and-bitmaps">Superblock and bitmaps</h3>

<p>The superblock stores most of the metadata about the file system, such as the
following: block size, timestamps, how many blocks and files are in use and how
many are free, etc.</p>

<p>Bitmaps are one way of tracking which data blocks and inodes are free. An index
in the bitmap set to <code>0</code> indicates a free slot, and an index set to <code>1</code>
indicates an occupied slot.</p>

<h3 id="inode">Inode</h3>

<p>The inode is the structure that stores metadata about a file. Attributes such as
permissions, size, location of data blocks that form the file and more are saved
in an inode.</p>

<p>The inodes are stored in blocks that together form the <em>inode table</em> as the
following figure shows.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_inode_table.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode table (detailed view)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For each slot in the inode bitmap set to <code>1</code>, there will be a corresponding
inode in the table. The index of the slot is the same as the index in the table.
And this explains the name inode being a short name for <em>index node</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-blocks">Data blocks</h3>

<p>As the name suggests, the data blocks are the blocks where the actual data
belonging to a file is written. These blocks are also used for different
purposes which we will see shortly.</p>

<h2 id="pointing-to-data">Pointing to data</h2>

<p>The inode needs to have a way of pointing to the data blocks that assemble the
file. The simplest way is to have <strong>direct pointers</strong>. In this case, each
pointer points to a block that has some of the file data. The problem is that
large files; where the size exceeds the number of direct pointers an inode can
have; are not supported in this mode. One way of overcoming this issue is to use
<strong>indirect pointers</strong>, which instead of storing user data they store pointers to
blocks that hold user data. For larger files, another layer of indirection is
added with <strong>double indirect pointers</strong>. And for even larger files, <strong>triple
indirect pointers</strong> are put to use.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://wiki.carlosgaldino.com/public/images/io_direct_pointers.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Inode multi-level index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To give an idea of the largest file size that each level permit let’s run an
example considering that each block size is 4 KiB. Research has shown that the
majority of files are small [1] so 12 direct pointers would allow for files up
to 48 KiB. Considering that each pointer takes 4 bytes, a single indirect
pointer would then allow a file to be up to around 4 MiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>With the addition of double indirect pointers the size would jump to around 4
GiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>And finally, with triple indirect pointers the files could have a size of around
4 TiB:</p>

<pre>(12 + 1024 + 1024<sup>2</sup> + 1024<sup>3</sup>) * 4 KiB
</pre>

<p>This approach might not be very efficient for handling large files. For example,
a file of 100 MiB requires the allocation of 25600 blocks. The performance can
be severely impacted in case the blocks were fragmented over the disk.</p>

<p>Some file systems use <strong>extents</strong> to help with this situation. In this approach,
there is a single pointer and a length to tell that the data starts at the
address of the pointer and runs for the given range of blocks. In our example
above, describing the same file would use a single extent of size 100 MiB.
Multiple extents can be used to support larger files.</p>

<h2 id="directories">Directories</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that there isn’t a specific structure for directories. The
reason behind it is the fact that inodes represent both files and directories.
The difference is in what is stored in the corresponding data blocks.
Directories are simply a list of all files that it includes. Each entry has the
form of <code>(name, index number)</code> so when looking up a particular file (or another
directory), the system uses the <code>name</code> to find the corresponding inode.</p>

<p>Searching for a file can be slow if a directory contains a large number of
files. This issue can be mitigated by maintaining the list sorted and using
binary search, or instead of representing it as a list, a hash table or a
balanced search tree could also be used.</p>

<h2 id="access-paths">Access paths</h2>

<h3 id="read">Read</h3>

<p>When reading from a file, the file system needs to traverse the entire path,
visiting each inode along the way until reaching the inode for the desired file.
Assuming the user has permission to access the file, the file system consults
which blocks are associated with it and then read the solicited data from them.</p>

<h3 id="write">Write</h3>

<p>When writing to a file, the same process has to happen to find the corresponding
inode. If a new block is required for the write, the file system has to allocate
the block, update the associated information (bitmap and inode), and write to
the block. So one write operation requires five I/O operations: one read to the
bitmap, one write to mark the new block as occupied, two to read and write to
the inode, and one writing the data in the block. This number can increase when
creating a new file because now the associated information of the directory also
has to be read and written to reflect this new file, and operations to create a
new inode.</p>

<h2 id="gotenksfs">GotenksFS</h2>

<p>As a side project, I decided to write my own file system in Rust as I’m learning
the language. Some aspects are inspired by ext4 [2] (and family), and in this
section, you will learn more about it. The file system uses FUSE [3], and the
disk is represented as a regular file. The block size can be configured as 1
KiB, 2 KiB, or 4 KiB. Files can have a size of up to 4 GiB for block sizes of 4
KiB while the file system could theoretically be up to 16 TiB in size.</p>

<h3 id="mkfs"><code>mkfs</code></h3>

<p>The first step is to create the image itself with the configuration values for
the file system. This is achieved via the <code>mkfs</code> command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mkfs disk.img <span>-s</span> <span>"10 GiB"</span> <span>-b</span> 4096
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running the command, the image is created with a total size of 10 GiB, and
each block in the file system has a size of 4 KiB.</p>

<p>In this step, the configuration values and other structures such as a root
directory are written to the image in the first block: the superblock. Its
corresponding bitmap entries, and data are also written. These values will be
necessary for the next step: mounting the file system.</p>

<h3 id="mount"><code>mount</code></h3>

<p>After creating the image, we need to mount it so we can start using it. The
<code>mount</code> command is used for this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./gotenksfs mount disk.img gotenks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can see some information about it:</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>File system after mounting</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="on-disk-structure">On-disk structure</h3>

<p>The superblock is written in the first 1024 bytes, and it holds the
configuration values provided in the <code>mkfs</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Superblock</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The next two blocks represent the data bitmap and inode bitmap. Then, a run of
<code>n</code> blocks are used for the inode table. And the blocks following that are the
ones where user data will be written.</p>

<p>The inode is defined as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Inode</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>mode</span><span>:</span> <span>libc</span><span>::</span><span>mode_t</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see above, inodes support double indirect pointers which means that
for a disk with a block size of 4 KiB, the maximum capacity of a file is 4 GiB.
The number of direct pointers is set to 12:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>const</span> <span>DIRECT_POINTERS</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When starting the FS for the first time, it will create the root directory using
the definition below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Directory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>entries</span><span>:</span> <span>BTreeMap</span><span>&lt;</span><span>OsString</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>checksum</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="block-groups">Block groups</h3>

<p>The inode bitmap has 4 KiB meaning that each bitmap block will have a capacity
for 32768 inodes. Suppose we round up the size of an <code>Inode</code> to 128 bytes; the
corresponding inode table will require 4 MiB of space. One of the ways for
structuring them would be to have many blocks dedicated to the bitmaps, then the
corresponding number blocks to store the inodes, and the remaining blocks for
user data.</p>

<p>Instead of doing that, we can create <em>block groups</em> that will always have one
block for the data bitmap and one for the inode bitmap. The next 1024 blocks
contain the inode table, and following that, 32768 blocks which are used for
user data.</p>

<!--
For a disk as in our case of 10 GiB, how many blocks should be dedicated to inode bitmaps?

Increasing the number of blocks to be inode bitmaps reduces the amount of available data blocks. And reducing the number of inode bitmaps restricts the total number of files supported by the system.

<p>Now that the “disk” is set up, we can start writing and reading files from it. Creating a new directory using <code>mkdir</code>:</p>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>
<span>----+-------------------+----------</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        1</span>
<span>  1 | foo@bar.baz       |        2</span>

<p>They say sunlight is the best disinfectant.  I think about that every time I hear about another protest against a speaker or an idea.  If you really want to kill stupid ideas, you should actually let people discuss them publicly.  Otherwise, they get pushed to the far corners of the internet filled with other nutjobs*  There they get sympathy, not just for their idea, but for the fact that they were not allowed to speak publicly about it.</p>



<p>If someone wants to give a controversial talk, like to say that women are less intelligent than men, or that the Holocaust never happened, or that one race is genetically inferior to the other races, the best way to marginalize those ideas and highlight how stupid they are is to let them speak.  Don’t even waste time on protesting the speaker.  Don’t cancel them.  Shrug and say it’s not even worth your time to fight, or, if you do want to fight, go listen to the talk and write a summary online about how idiotic the talk was.</p>



<p>The way to defeat ideas you don’t like is to make them compete in the public domain of ideas, not to censor them.  When you censor them, you think you are squashing them out, but you are just giving them protected time and space to grow and find more supporters.</p>



<p>*<em>if you are reading this at some point in the future, it is quite possible that the term “nutjob” is politically incorrect for some reason, but as of the date I am writing this it is within the bounds of things you can say, so please don’t crucify me in 2035 for writing this in 2020.</em> </p>

<p>Cloud-native applications are on the rise thanks to the scalability and flexibility they provide. However, this type of architecture has its own challenges. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will solve most of them, like <strong>defining delivery procedures, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/cracking-the-continuous-deployment-code/" target="_blank">delivering applications independently</a>, and gaining observability of the numerous building blocks in a system</strong> are some of them.</p>



<p>A CI/CD pipeline is the key to <strong>automating the steps of the software delivery process</strong>. This includes initiating code builds, running automated tests, and deploying to a testing or production environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One CI/CD <strong>pipeline</strong> consists of multiple steps executed one after another or in parallel. There are two known pipeline syntaxes — <strong>Scripted </strong>and <strong>Declarative</strong>. The key difference between them is their flexibility. </p>



<p>Although both syntaxes are based on Groovy DSL, the <strong>Scripted Pipeline Syntax</strong> is less restrictive. It also allows almost anything that can be done in Groovy. This means that the script can easily become hard to read and write.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the <strong>Declarative syntax </strong>is more restrictive and provides a well-defined structure, which is ideal for simpler CI/CD pipelines. This syntax supports the “pipeline as code” concept. Therefore, you can write in a file that can be checked into a source control management system like Git. </p>



<p>In order to make it more convenient for developers to set up a CI/CD pipeline, <strong><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports the Declarative syntax to define build procedures along with the source code</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Declarative CI/CD pipelines</strong></h2>



<p>For the pipeline process to work, each component/microservice should have a file named <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>on the root level in its source code. This file contains the specification of the build process. </p>



<p>During the build process, Microtica extracts the specification from the code. Then, it creates a state machine to drive the defined process.</p>



<blockquote><p>In order to ensure a single source of truth for pipeline specification, Microtica does NOT allow changes in the Build pipelines from the UI. Changes will only take effect from the YAML file provided in each source code repository. We find this very helpful in avoiding possible confusion of definition, maintenance, and, most importantly, debugging problems in the process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Define a CI/CD pipeline</strong></h2>



<p>There are no limitations to the steps of the build pipeline that you can define. Here is one example of a <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file that defines a <strong>build pipeline for NodeJS application</strong>. This pipeline executes three particular commands defined in the <em>commands </em>section.</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
 StartAt: Build
 States:
   Build:
     Type: Task
     Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
     Parameters:
       commands:
       - npm install
       - npm test
       - npm prune --production
       sourceLocation: "$.trigger.source.location"
       artifacts: true
     End: true</code></pre>



<ul><li><strong><em>Pipeline</em></strong><em> — </em>is the root key which defines the start of the pipeline section</li><li><strong><em>StartAt</em></strong><em> — </em>defines the first action of the pipeline</li><li><strong><em>States</em></strong><em> — </em>defines a list of states for the particular pipeline</li><li><strong><em>Type</em></strong><em> — a </em>type of pipeline action. Always set it to <em>Task</em>.</li><li>Resource — an action that the engine will use. Currently, we support <em>microtica.actions.cmd</em>, an action that executes bash scripting.</li><li>Parameters — a set of parameters that are given to the action<ul><li><strong><em>commands</em></strong><em> — </em>a list of bash commands. Here, you define your custom scripts for build, test, code quality checks, etc.</li><li><strong><em>sourceLocation</em></strong> — the location where the action can find the source code. You should NOT change this. Once pulled from the Git repository, Microtica stores the artifacts on a location specified by the user for the particular component/microservice. <em>$.trigger.source.location</em> defines that location.</li><li><strong><em>artifacts</em></strong> — a value that defines that this build will produce artifacts which will be stored in S3 and used during deployment. Set this value should to <em>false</em> in case the artifact of the build is Docker image</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>End</em></strong><em> — </em>defines that this is the last action in the pipeline.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://www.microtica.com/">Microtica</a> supports bash commands for the execution action. In the future, we are planning to allow developers to define their own custom actions.</p>



<h2>Getting a Docker image ready for deployment</h2>



<p>Let’s create an extended pipeline from the example above, adding an additional step to prepare a Docker image for deployment:</p>



<pre><code>Pipeline:
  StartAt: Build
  States:
    Build:
      Type: Task
      Resource: microtica.actions.cmd
      Parameters:
        environmentVariables:
          pipelineId: "$.pipeline.id"
          version: "$.commit.version"
        commands:
        - echo Starting build procedure...
        - npm install
        - npm test

        - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
        - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION --no-include-email)

        - echo Checking if repository exists in ECR. If not, create one
        - repoExists=`aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[?repositoryName=='$pipelineId']" --output text`
        - if [ -z "$repoExists" ]; then aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $pipelineId; fi

        - awsAccountId=$(echo $CODEBUILD_BUILD_ARN | cut -d':' -f 5)
        - artifactLocation=$awsAccountId.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$pipelineId

        - echo Build Docker image...
        - docker build -t $pipelineId .
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:$version
        - docker tag $pipelineId $artifactLocation:latest

        - echo Push Docker image
        - docker push $artifactLocation
        sourceLocation: "$.source.location"
        artifacts: false
      End: true</code></pre>



<p>In this example, we first inject environment variables in the step runtime with <em>environmentVariables</em> parameter (<em>$.pipeline.id</em> and <em>$.commit.version</em> are both provided by Microtica).</p>



<p>The CI/CD pipeline in the latest example starts by executing necessary instructions to build and test the code. Once this is done, Microtica creates an ECR repository if it doesn’t already exist.</p>



<p>Once we have the ECR repository in place, the last step is to build a new Docker image and then push it in the repository.</p>

<p>After you define the <strong><em>microtica.yaml </em></strong>file with the build pipeline, you can <strong>automate</strong> your build process in Microtica when you create the component or microservice with the wizard in the portal. This option will add a webhook to your repository. </p>



<p>A webhook is a listener that triggers a build process whenever you <strong>push new code to your repository branch</strong>. This way, you can be sure that you’re always working with the newest changes.</p>



<p>Building the docker image gave us an artifact so we can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;<strong>You can do this from&nbsp;<em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em>&nbsp;Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you deploy your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster&nbsp;you can select the scaling options. Moreover, you can also set up <strong>continuous delivery</strong> for your microservice.</p>

<p>Once you trigger a build manually or automatically, follow the build process in the portal and see the events in real-time. If the build fails, it will mark it with red on the screen and it will show the error in the logs.</p>



<p>Follow all the pipelines for your components and microservices in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/pipelines" target="_blank">Pipelines overview page</a> and track their status. Microtica will mark a pipeline as not healthy if there are several failed builds detected. </p>



<p>From this page, you can access any build in the history of your project. More importantly, you can also and inspect the logs to find the problems.</p>

<p>We are strong advocates for automated pipelines as they <strong>remove manual errors.</strong> Moreover, they are crucial for reliable and sustainable software delivery. </p>



<p>They make software developers <strong>more productive,</strong> releasing them from the need to perform pipeline steps manually. Most importantly, they reduce the stress around new product releases.</p>

What if you could debug type errors with a simple compile time print statement? Write highly flexible systems by being able to introspect into types at compile time? Pre-calculate large portions of your programs for great efficiency? Typed functional programming is a great and fun way to write resilient software, and as type systems have become more and more expressive in recent years, we are able to program sophisticated and useful properties at the type level for even better compile time safety. Just one problem: It is very difficult, requires advanced knowledge of the type system, the syntax is convoluted, the error messages are impenetrable, and it is nearly impossible to debug. This talk will dive into why we should steal static introspection from languages like Nim, and D, state-of-the-art imperative programming languages which can solve all these issues, make type systems much more approachable without losing any expressive power, and offer new design possibilities for functional programs.</em></p><p id="bf8b"><em>Join us on Zoom: </em><a href="https://zoom.us/j/95139644343" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://zoom.us/j/95139644343</em></a></p><p id="f699"><em>Join us on YouTube: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>https://youtu.be/yGq0KnkqOgI</em></a></p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Koxyxq-wrBx9iGfe?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="31bb"><em>Many things are being said about Deep Reinforcement Learning, but sometimes it is really hard to know where to start.

<p>Our spunky little Honda Fit is now 13 years old, and although it has served us well, we have begun to outgrow it.</p>

<p>I started researching minivans, and one particular online-only auto seller seemed to have an attractive inventory.</p>

<p>So I decided to create an account with them and set up some filters and alerts.</p>

<p>But creating an account was harder than it appeared.</p>

<p>I entered my email address on their sign-up page.  The input field immediately turned red, and the page informed me that my email address was invalid.</p>

<p>I encounter this problem occasionally, because I use subaddressing in my email address.</p>

<p>A normal email address looks like this: <code>username@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When you use subaddressing, you tack on a little extra bit between your username and the @ sign: <code>username+subaddress@domain.com</code>.</p>

<p>When the site emails you, the subaddress gets ignored for the purpose of routing the message to you, 
   but it shows up in the "To" field of the email address.  That can be tremendously useful.  It allows
   you to set up filters to always allow or always deny messages that include a specific subaddress,
   and it can sometimes be used to determine whether a site has had a data breach or sold your contact
   information to spammers.</p>

<p>Although subaddressing is widely supported by email service providers, including Google's Gmail, it continues to trip up sites
   that perform email address validation using regular expressions, also known by the abbreviation regex.</p>
   
<p>Regex allows site developers to specify what a valid email address looks like.  
   It can determine whether an email address contains invalid characters, or whether it's missing an @ sign.</p>
   
<p>The problem is, valid email addresses come in many forms, and many regular expressions used to validate email addresses
   are not able to recognize the full range of valid formats.</p>
   
<p>In the case of the auto seller's form validation, I was able to inspect their Javascript code.
   The portion of the email validation regex that deals with the username (the part before the @ sign)
   looks like this:</p>
   
<p><code>^[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[_a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*</code></p>

<p>The key thing about this regex snippet is that the only characters that are considered valid are
   alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods.</p>
   
<p>If a plus sign is present, as when using subaddressing, it treats the email address as invalid, even though it is perfectly valid
   — and has been for years.</p>
   
<p>While it's frustrating that many sites continue to reject email addresses that use subaddressing, I have a Plan B.</p>

<p>I instead use a secondary email address without subaddressing, which is associated with <a href="https://newlywed.science/">newlywed.science</a>,
   a domain I use to promote my book <i>Experiments for Newlyweds</i>.</p>
   
<p>I entered that email address into the sign-up form, but again I was informed that it was invalid.</p>

<p>I took another look at the email validation regex and discovered an even stupider issue.</p>

<p>Here is the portion of their email validation regex that deals with the domain (the part after the @ sign):</p>
   
<p><code>[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*(\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4})$</code></p>

<p>The relevant part of this snippet is at the very end.  It says that the top-level domain (TLD) must be between two and four letters long.</p>

<p>The most well-known TLDs, such as .com, .org, .net, .edu, and .gov, tend to have three letters.  
   Country-specific TLDs, such as .uk or .de, tend to have two letters.</p>
   
<p>But starting around the turn of the century, more and more new TLDs came into use.  
   For instance, .museum became active in June 2001, and .travel began accepting registrations in January 2006.</p>
   
<p>So TLDs that exceed four letters in length have been around for quite a while.</p>

<p>Yet anyone with an email address associated with such a TLD is locked out of creating an account with this auto seller because of this regex.</p>

<p>It's frustrating that major websites continue to rely on such shoddy email address validation, and this time I decided to make my frustration known.</p>

<p>I searched around for a contact email address on the site, but the best I could find was a Live Chat feature.</p>

<p>So, at 2 p.m. Eastern, I opened a Live Chat session and encouraged them to fix their terrible regex.</p>

<p>A robo-responder informed me that unfortunately, my message could not be handled, because Live Chat is only available between 8 a.m. and 8:45 p.m. Eastern.</p>

<p><em>Thet Lynn Han, known as Ricky Thet, is the 36-year-old founder and CEO of Bagan IT. The Myanmar-based development company has been operating since 2010, when Thet moved back to Myanmar from Singapore. Bagan’s products include a local-language keyboard, an e-bookstore, and a fortune-telling service.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Are we coders or phone fixers?</strong></h3>



<p>When my <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16546688">country began to change</a> in 2010, to open up, I knew I wanted to be part of building the new Myanmar. But, at that time, there was none of the basic infrastructure the rest of the world takes for granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I loved computers. I couldn’t study computer science in Myanmar when I graduated from high school in 2000, so I left for Singapore to study and then stayed there to work.</p>



<p>During the ten years I was&nbsp;living in Singapore, I wanted to read books in Burmese, but back then, almost none of them were digitized. You had to have a hard copy. So when I came back,<strong> </strong>I<strong> </strong>wanted to put Burmese-language books online.&nbsp;</p>



	




<p>In 2012, when we launched our first apps, very <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=MM">few people were online</a> in Myanmar, and data was very expensive. People would often turn off their data when they weren’t using it. That meant it was almost impossible to get user insights about what wasn’t working for users, and digital literacy was very low.</p>



<p>We began working with the mobile phone technicians at the local tuck shops where people buy and fix their phones. Often, when customers had issues with their phones or just didn’t know how to use certain features, they’d come back to the shops where they had purchased them and have the technicians help. We’d show these guys how to use our apps so they could answer a customer’s question about our products. If we were releasing something new, we’d let the technicians know, so they could tell their customers.</p>



<p>We had whole relationship teams who would travel around the country to meet with mobile shop owners, collect their insights, and show them how to use our latest applications.</p>



	




<h3><strong>One product at a time</strong></h3>



<p>Our first product was a Burmese-language keyboard. The most common Burmese font, Zawgyi, is not compatible with Unicode, the international standard for encoding fonts, and the background processing is based on the English language. This was especially an issue, because between 40% and 50% of the phones in Myanmar are Chinese phones made for the Chinese domestic market. All of these obstacles combined meant there were a lot of rendering issues and limitations for the Burmese font.</p>

<p>Google didn’t launch its Burmese-language keyboard in Myanmar until a few years ago, but we were here first. We could see what the Burmese people needed. Our keyboard currently has 10 million monthly active users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the Burmese keyboard, we tackled books. The publishers were suspicious of digitizing books at first, and it took years of building relationships with them to get the 10,000 books we have online now. Same thing with our fortune-telling app, Min Thein Kha, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20200425-online-mystics-cash-in-during-myanmar-virus-lockdown">which has 50,000 daily active users</a>. Once the payments for the e-bookstore were running, it was a proof of concept we brought to the family of Min Thein Kha, the most famous Burmese fortune teller. They saw that the fortune tellers they worked with could get paid if they put their services on an app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the biggest challenge was payments. Less than 2% of people in Myanmar have<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/sg/Documents/consumer-business/sea-cb-myanmar-consumer-survey-2020.pdf"> access to a credit card</a>, and <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/countrybook/Myanmar.pdf">75% </a>are unbanked. We needed to find a different way to bill them.</p>



<p>The local telecom companies are the only entities that cover the whole population. We persuaded them to let us charge users for app-based purchases on their telephone bills, but we had to be very deliberate when designing to make it clear to people that that’s what they should expect. Even that was not a perfect solution; a credit card might charge you an extra 5% on top of your purchase. With the telecom companies, it could be anywhere from 45% to 60% in additional charges and fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to partner with the telecom companies for billing, we needed to be able to ensure a minimum guaranteed revenue, so it was, and still is, very important that everything we built be attractive to our users. And we needed to demonstrate that we had the capacity to handle all of the customer support.</p>



<h3><strong>Building everything yourself</strong></h3>



<p>In other countries, these kinds of payment and customer-service systems&nbsp;would already be set up. Things are changing quickly here in Myanmar — mobile money is becoming more popular — but even now, I’d say only 30% of our work is building the apps, whereas 70% is dealing with these kinds of infrastructure issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as things are progressing and more, and Burmese people are coming online and getting phones, we can call customers directly to get insights. We’re also getting some data using Facebook, but more than anything else, we rely on calling people for feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the early years, we had an automatic refund policy —&nbsp;if someone said they were charged incorrectly, we’d give the money back, no questions asked. It’s an important way to build trust with people who are using apps like these for the first time. If we didn’t get it right, how would users ever trust something like mobile money?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We saw it as an investment in our users and in our future.</p>

			<p>APIs are everywhere within your organization. Many may be internal, but we’re willing to bet there are many third-party web services and APIs that your business depends on too. Keeping track of them all, and ensuring that your team chooses the best APIs for their needs can be a challenge. In some cases, your organization may be using an API they don’t even know about. The solution to this “web of APIs” is to apply the concept of API governance to your API dependencies.</p><h2 id="what-is-api-governance">What is API Governance?</h2><p>Before we go into applying the concept to third-party APIs, we should look at what API governance is.</p><p>API governance is a set of policies and procedures that act as <strong>guidelines for how your organization uses APIs</strong>. Governance is all about security and reliability. It can take many shapes, but it helps with things like:</p><ul><li>Establishing criteria for choosing APIs.</li><li>Defining any shared standards, like security, that APIs will share.</li><li>Aids in the discovery of existing APIs in the organization.</li><li>Laying out plans for usage, versioning, etc.</li></ul><p>This process makes a lot of sense when a good part of your stack is dedicated to providing APIs, but what about the external APIs that your organization consumes? Can you apply a similar approach to the APIs you depend on, even if you don’t have control over them?</p><h3 id="applying-the-idea-of-governance-to-third-party-apis">Applying the idea of governance to third-party APIs</h3><p>As your organization grows, there’s a high likelihood that every API consumed won’t be known. Development teams working on different products and services may have some overlap, but what are the chances of two teams signing up for the same API? What about choosing two differing APIs that serve the same purpose?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg" alt="Governance over APIs" srcset="https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1000w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 1600w, https://blog.bearer.sh/content/images/size/w2400/2020/06/blog-diagrams---governance.jpg 2400w"></figure><p>For third party APIs, the governance process can lead to two key artifacts: an <strong>API catalog</strong> and a <strong>set of guidelines for choosing APIs</strong>. Let’s look at some API governance best practices, but applied to third-party API dependencies.</p><h2 id="api-catalogs">API Catalogs</h2><p>When we onboard new customers to Bearer, some often discover that their organization is using APIs they didn’t know about. This isn’t unique to giant organizations either. Even small teams can run into this problem. An API catalog can be a valuable way to centralize details about all the services and APIs that your organization uses. The format this catalog takes can change with the needs of your organization, but the benefits can directly affect your development teams as well as your business strategy. Let’s look at a few benefits, and things you may want to include in your own API catalog.</p><h3 id="increased-discoverability">Increased Discoverability</h3><p>By collecting details about each API, your team can create a centralized location for the whole organization. This allows teams to discover which SaaS providers you already have a relationship with, and which services are currently available. </p><p>This is also a great way to avoid duplication across teams, and avoids the selection of similar APIs that serve the same purpose.</p><h3 id="sla-tracking">SLA Tracking</h3><p>Service-level Agreements (SLA) are a contract between your organization and the API provider. It can often be hard to keep track of expectations at a high level. A central catalog of APIs offers a place for all SLA details to be stored.</p><p>You can take this a step further by incorporating monitoring to ensure that services are meeting their requirements, and even tie this directly into the catalog for at-a-glance oversight.</p><h3 id="centralized-test-coverage">Centralized Test Coverage</h3><p>While it may not be feasible or even possible to incorporate testing directly into an API catalog, it can be an excellent place to store coverage statistics. How are, or perhaps in the dark, are you about the last time tests were run on a particular API endpoint? Is it possible there is a rarely used API in your stack that has been down for a while, unbeknownst to your team? Bring the results into your API catalog.</p><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>Are you paying for service that you no longer use? By tracking API usage across an entire organization, you can examine areas such as:</p><ul><li>Which teams are currently using an API?</li><li>Is the organization on the most cost-effective plan?</li><li>Are there multiple, similar APIs in use when a single one could suffice?</li><li>On <em>pay-as-you-go</em> plans where you pay for each call, are you often over budget?</li></ul><h3 id="knowledge-base">Knowledge Base</h3><p>The centralized test coverage portion covers part of this benefit, but your API catalog can act as a central knowledge base for every API in your organization. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>Internal documentation related to an API (like a Postman collection).</li><li>Links to status pages, official documentation, and examples.</li><li>Locations of credentials.</li><li>Points of contact for API consumers in each department.</li></ul><p>You can use an existing solution to create the catalog, though the space is mostly filled with API management platforms designed around providing internal APIs to your teams. Alternately, you can build your own solution or add the functionality to a tool you already use. This catalog is essentially a content management system (CMS) that stores the necessary information about each API as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Make the process of registering APIs to the catalog easy—or even automatic—for developers, as it will increase the adoption of the centralized hub.</p><h2 id="defining-api-selection-guidelines">Defining API Selection Guidelines</h2><p>How does your organization select which APIs to implement? Does each team—or developer—make decisions on their own? Is there an approval process? Are there restrictions on what kinds of APIs makes it into production? What about SLA requirements?</p><p>These questions, and others like them, are the foundation for defining a set of API selection guidelines. In many cases, you will be starting from a point of existing API dependencies. This is a good time to assess the landscape. Poll your teams, collect the data, and organize it. While existing APIs can be excluded from a selection policy, it is good to at least compare them to the guidelines you set. Start by defining the criteria that new APIs will need to meet. These criteria can include:</p><ul><li>A minimum set of SLA requirements (uptime guarantees, time to response, etc.).</li><li>Deprecation timelines and versioning details.</li><li>Cost vs. Value: Are there alternatives at lower costs? Is it worth it to build instead of buy?</li><li>Cross-team impact: Will an API be useful to more than one part of the organization.</li><li>Support availability: Does the price come with reliable support, both for the development with and management of the API?</li><li>Stack compatibility: What stacks have SDKs, and what would it take to continue using the API if your stack changes?</li><li>Ease of use and depth of documentation.</li><li>Data policy: Whether handling GDPR compliance or HIPPA laws, an API’s data policy has a direct impact on your own data management.</li></ul><h2 id="enforcing-governance-and-adding-value-to-your-organization">Enforcing governance and adding value to your organization</h2><p>With a catalog set up, and guidelines in place, enforcement keeps the process going. It’s important to establish a set of processes that doesn’t limit your teams ability to experiment and work efficiently, but also protects your organization from the shadow APIs that suddenly appear in your stack. Make sure the approval cycle is low-friction and the monitoring of new and existing APIs makes it easy to track usage.</p><p>Governance is a way to bring structure to your organization’s dependence on APIs, but it shouldn’t be yet another piece of technical debt. The good news is you don’t need to dive all-in right away. Simply starting to monitor API usage and performance across the organization as a whole is an excellent first step. At <a href="https://www.bearer.sh/">Bearer</a>, part of our offering helps with this by automatically monitoring API calls and organizing them in a central dashboard. This is one way to quickly view which APIs you are using effectively and monitor them from a performance, SLA, and anomaly standpoint. Explore ways to tie governance into your existing processes. The catalog can even live in your team’s internal knowledge base.</p><p>Take the first step toward adding more observability and oversight to the APIs that your organization uses. Set up a policy and implement the appropriate tooling to control and enforce the policy. This will help build a culture around scrutinizing and monitoring API dependencies and improve the overall resilience of your applications.<br></p>

 <div>
  
  <p><label>Posted on <strong>26 July 2020</strong></label></p><p><strong>Background</strong><br>
Near the end of 2019 I stumbled across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMbK7PYQux4&amp;t=6m57s">talk</a> by procedural generation researcher <a href="https://www.anastasiaopara.com/">Anastasia Opara</a>. In the talk she presents a novel algorithm for example based texture synthesis. The goal of example based texture synthesis is to take one or more example textures and synthesize a new visually similar output texture.    </p>
<p>Here's an example from the project README:
  </p><p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/readme-example.jpeg" width="70%"> 
</p> 
<p>I was really curious about this algorithm and wanted to see if I could make it run faster as an exercise in profiling.  </p>
<p><strong>Embarking on a Journey</strong><br>
While I'm not going to go into great detail about how the algorithm works (see Anastasia's talk if you're curious!) it's helpful to understand the basic idea.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/synthesis-diagram.png" width="80%"> 
</p>

<div><p>We start with an empty output image and seed it with a few random pixels from our example images.<br>
Then repeat the following procedure until the output image is filled: </p><p> 
1. Choose an empty pixel in the output image. We will call this the center pixel.<br>
2. Find the k closest non empty pixels to the center in the output image. Note in the first few steps there might be fewer than k pixels in the entire output image. The locations of these k pixels relative to the center pixel define a neighborhood.<br>
3. Come up with a list of the most promising neighborhoods in the example image(s)<br>
4. Compare the most promising candidate neighborhoods in the example image(s) to the neighborhood around the center pixel and pick the most similar one.<br>
5. Fill the center pixel in the output image with the color of the center pixel in the best matching neighborhood.  </p></div>
<p>One last important detail is that the algorithm works on filling multiple empty pixels in parallel to take full advantage of multi core cpus.  </p>
<p><strong>Missteps and Micro optimizations</strong><br>
Now it was time to optimize. The first thing I did was to run the program on a few sample inputs with the xcode instruments profiler (partly because it was new to me). I even found a cool <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/b20eca/introducing_cargoinstruments_zerohassle_profiling/">library</a> which made it easier to use instruments with rust. Using instruments I was able to see how much each instruction contributed to the overall runtime of the program.  </p>
<p>Being able to see time per instruction was perfect for me because I was looking for micro optimizations. I'm using the term micro optimization here to mean a very small change which has a relatively large impact compared to its size. Even though they are not always a good idea, micro optimizations seemed like the best place to start because they would be less of an investment on my end. I also didn't know if the project maintainers would be excited about large code changes.  </p>
<p>Looking at the profiler output I was drawn to this line which looked like an unnecessary array resize operation nested within our once per pixel loop.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/first-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note about interpreting the numbers above is that this algorithm runs in several passes and is divided among multiple threads. The image above only shows one pass which accounts for about 12.6% of the runtime of the entire program. However each pass contains the highlighted instruction and behaves similarly. To get a rough estimate of the true impact of this instruction these percentages should be multiplied by a factor of about 8 (100/12.6). So the highlighted instruction really accounts for about 9.5% of the total program runtime.</p>
<p>After I eliminated the unnecessary array resize instruction I ran the program through the profiler again which seemed to confirm that it had gotten about 10% faster which I figured was pretty good for a first try. Of course, the profiler adds some overhead to the program, so to truly confirm that my optimization worked I needed to run it on a couple of examples without any profiling. When I did this I was shocked to see no improvement. </p>
<p>So what was happening? It turns out the cargo-instruments command I was running compiled the program in <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-does-cargo-build-not-optimise-by-default/4150">debug mode by default</a> which turned off significant optimizations. When I built the program in release mode the unnecessary array resize was automatically removed. I learned two very important lessons from this: First, of all when you benchmark you have to think carefully about what exactly you're benchmarking. Secondly, the compiler is smart and makes some micro optimizations for you.  </p>
<p>A little embarrassed and somewhat defeated, I went back to the drawing board.  </p>
<p>I grabbed a couple more profiles making sure this time to use release mode. After poking around some more I found that a significant amount of time was being spent loading pixels from the source images into intermediate buffers which were later used for neighborhood comparisons step of the algorithm.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/second-profile.png" width="90%"> 
</p>

<p>Again using the same runtime adjustment from the last profiling section this function seemed to take about 37.6% of the total runtime. I suspected cache misses were a significant contributor here, but regardless of the actual problem source I knew that reading the neighborhood pixels for each candidate was expensive.   </p>
<p>Of course the algorithm still needed to do the candidate neighborhood comparisons so I couldn't completely eliminate reading each candidate's neighborhood pixels. Luckily for me there was already a related optimization in the project,</p>
<p>This related optimization targeted the actual comparison step when finding a best candidate neighborhood. In the comparison step each candidate neighborhood was assigned a score by summing up the differences (always positive) between it's pixels and the target's neighborhood pixels. It turned out that often you could stop summing up these differences early if you already knew this current candidate's score was going to be higher than the best candidate's score so far.   </p>
<p>Once I understood this I just extended the idea to avoid reading the pixels needed for the unnecessary comparisons by removing the intermediate buffers and reading pixels only as they were needed which seemed to greatly reduce the average number of reads. I tested my optimization on a few different laptops with several output sizes using references images from the repository as inputs. It seemed like I had improved performance by around 15-25% depending on the output texture size, reference images and the computer I was using.  </p>
<p>Quantifying performance impact was a lot harder than I thought it would be. There were so many different parameters to the program that could affect performance: size of the reference image(s), size of the output images, number of threads. Hardware differences were also a huge factor. If I were really being rigorous I would have tried to put together a large collection of images and output sizes to benchmark off of. Due to time and budget constraints I did not assemble a super rigorous benchmark but my appreciation for the problem of performance testing has grown tremendously.  </p>
<p>Once I was confident that my micro optimization worked I made my <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/69">first pull request</a>. It was accepted but to my surprise the performance gains that the reviewers saw were not nearly as good as the ones I did. When one of them benchmarked it on an AMD Threadripper (with 64 virtual cores) the speed up was so small it might have just been noise.  </p>
<p><strong>Blocking And Locking</strong>  </p>
<p>At this point I decided to use some Google Cloud free trial credits I had lying around to spin up some larger machines to test on. Using a 64 core machine I noticed that just like on the thread ripper I didn't see much of a performance improvement from my micro optimization. I tried multiple tests with different numbers of threads (from 0 up to 64) and saw that as the number of threads increased the performance gain from my optimization dropped.  </p>
<p>So in my mind there were two explanations. First was that my optimization didn't save as much time when there were multiple threads. Second was that there was another source of latency which increased with the number of threads and that simply got so big it drowned out any noticeable effects of my optimization. It turned out this second explanation was correct.  </p>
<p>The additional source of latency turned out to be thread contention. To get the k nearest neighbors for each candidate pixel the algorithm was using a data structure called an r*tree. An r*tree provides a way to efficiently store points for nearest neighbor lookups. Exactly how an r*tree works is not actually super important here. The problem was that there was only one r*tree shared across the entire image. To prevent race conditions the r*tree had been wrapped in a read-write lock. This type of lock allows parallel reads but writes must happen in series. Reads also cannot occur while a write is in progress. With large numbers of threads, writing became a large bottleneck. Looking at a graph of program runtime versus number of cores also helps illustrate this effect.  </p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/before-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>What I realized is that after a few pixels had been filled in the chance that one of the k nearest neighbors would be super far away from the candidate pixel was negligible. So I broke the images in to a grid of r*trees. The basic idea was that writes in two close cells could still block but writes in two far away cells could now be done in parallel. More details can be dound in <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/texture-synthesis/pull/70">my second pull request</a>. To see the improvement from this change we can look at this graph below of synthesis speeds before / after:</p>
<p>
    <img src="http://peterstefek.me/images/texture-optimization/after-graph.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>An important note here is that the improved version does not scale linearly either. In an ideal world maybe it would but there are several complicating factors that are at play here. First of all the program has some initialization costs as well as having to synthesize the first few pixels in series. Both of these steps cannot be parallelized. Secondly contention is complicated and can crop up in many places. I believe I did eliminate a large source of contention but I'm sure there is more that could be done. Finally this algorithm is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> and will ultimately have to have some amount of informtion shared between threads.</p>

<p>A team lead’s main concerns are team performance, interactions with other teams, and delivering projects on time.</p>



<p>Team leads should not be a bottleneck. You shouldn’t assign the most important and/or most complex tasks to yourself. You shouldn’t tie all processes to yourself.</p>



<p>Trust and acceptance of failures is the best way to eliminate yourself as a bottleneck. You should allow teammates to make mistakes, but it’s also important to be in control of how crucial mistakes will be.</p>



<p>As a team lead, you should trust your teammates and give them challenging and meaningful tasks. They need to feel their importance. By challenging them, you create growth opportunities. No one wants to be bored with tedious tasks all the time.</p>



<p>Look for a balance. Tasks that are too challenging can make the programmer question their confidence. Too many challenges will put them under unhealthy constant stress.</p>



<p>With self-doubts and stress, a member of your team will work on their tasks exponentially slower than they could with confidence and a good mood.</p>



<p>You can offer help when you notice that your teammate is struggling. Watch for signs from their mood. The simple question “How are things going?” is a tool to spot the problems.</p>



<p>By listening to your colleagues about their troubles and obstacles, you help them relieve their tension and regain their feeling of confidence. And if you can offer advice on how to solve the problem, that’s even better!</p>



<p>Pairing up with a colleague in trouble is another way to unblock the project.</p>



<p>By not burdening yourself with important projects with tight deadlines, you create time. Use this time to:</p>



<ul><li>Be conscious of the current state of your team members</li><li>Be available to offer help</li><li>Think about processes, what is working, and what is not</li><li>Think about current, upcoming, and past projects</li></ul>



<p>A good team lead does the following:</p>



<ul><li>Assigns important, challenging projects to teammates</li><li>Assigns blocking tasks to teammates</li><li>Is available to listen and offer help to teammates</li><li>Has time to be aware of the current state of team members</li><li>Has time to reflect on processes and projects</li></ul>

<p><strong>Can Audio Deepfakes Really Fake a Human?</strong></p>
<p>Audio deepfakes are the new frontier for business compromise schemes and are becoming more common pathways for criminals to deceptively gain access to corporate funds. Nisos recently investigated and obtained an original attempted deepfake synthetic audio used in a fraud attempt against a technology company. The deepfake took the form of a voicemail message from the company’s purported CEO, asking an employee to call back to “finalize an urgent business deal.” The recipient immediately thought it suspicious and did not contact the number, instead referring it to their legal department, and as a result the attack was not successful.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<!--more-->
<p>Nisos investigated the phone number the would-be attacker used and determined it was a VOIP service with no owner registration information. It was likely simply acquired and used as a “burner” for this fraud attempt only. While there was no actual voicemail message associated with the number, we made no attempt for live contact with the owner of the phone number for legal reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Deepfake Audio Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Nisos analyzed the deepfake voicemail audio recording with an audio spectrogram tool called Spectrum3d. Looking to detect any anomalies, we immediately noticed the highs spiking repeatedly in the spectrogram (see graphic below). We initially suspected the deepfake creator used audio playing over on multiple channels to help mask the voice.</p>
<p><strong><i><img src="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png" alt="pasted image 0 (7)" width="351" srcset="https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=176&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 176w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=351&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 351w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=527&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 527w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=702&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 702w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=878&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 878w, https://www.nisos.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pasted%20image%200%20(7).png?width=1053&amp;name=pasted%20image%200%20(7).png 1053w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"></i></strong><strong><i>Graphic 1: Spectrogram analysis of the deepfake audio, displaying major inconsistencies in pitch and tone.</i></strong></p>
<p>We additionally noticed the audio was very choppy and not consistent with a similar human voice recording. When we altered the audio speed and played back at 1.2 speed, the audio then sounded more like a standard text to speech system. Most interesting, when we amplified the sound to detect any background noise we were unable to find any traces, which further indicated this was manipulated audio.</p>
<p>We then compared the deepfake spectrogram analysis with results of a "normal" human voice on a similar recording. We can immediately see how the pitch and tone is more smoothed out, as well as the ability to detect faint background noise.</p>

<p>We were unable to determine the exact software or voice model used to create this deepfake as we would have required access to a large enough sample of the attacker’s other deepfake audio files (we would likely need tens if not hundreds of files, and this assumes the attacker made more than just this one). However, we note several complicating factors an actor would have to overcome to create a more realistic deepfake audio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Capturing high quality audio with little to no background noise.</li>
<li>Staging the call for audio delivering in a realistic scenario (tone of the person talking, background noise and reason for the call) in which the person wouldn’t feel the need to call the person back.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Finding a way to leave a message, so they can avoid an in-person conversation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is likely the attacker in this scenario above utilized a feature most cell/VOIP service providers offer, which is the ability to bypass the ring option and go straight into the voice mail using the `#` key.</p>

<p><strong>Has This Happened Before?</strong></p>
<p>The most famous use of deep fake synthetic audio technology in criminal fraud was a September 2019 incident involving a British energy company. The criminals reportedly used voice-mimicking software to imitate the British executive’s speech and trick his subordinate into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to a secret account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The managing director of this company, believing his boss was on the phone, followed orders to wire more than $240,000 to an account in Hungary.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Symantec security researchers reported in February on three cases of audio deepfakes used against private companies by impersonating the voice of the business’s CEO.<sup>2 </sup>The criminals reportedly trained machine learning engines from audio obtained on conference calls, YouTube, social media updates and even TED talks, to copy the voice patterns of company bosses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They created audio deepfakes replicating the CEO’s voice and called senior members of the finance department to ask for funds to be sent urgently. There was no additional reporting on which companies these were, whether the techniques were successful, or whether Symantec was able to obtain recordings of the deepfakes themselves.</p>
<p>Without actual digital capture of the audio, and additional forensics analysis, it is unclear whether these attempts were in fact deepfake synthetic manipulated audio. Regardless, the ability to generate synthetic audio extends an e-criminal’s toolkit and the criminal at the end of the day still has to effectively use social engineering tactics to induce someone into taking an action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Criminals and potentially broader nation state actors also learn from each other, so as these high-profile cases gain more notoriety and success, we anticipate more illicit actors trying them and learning from others who have paved the way.</p>
<p>Additionally, as deepfakes become easier to create or purchase, and the quality of synthetic manipulation -both audio (and video)- increases, we anticipate wider deployment of these e-crime exploits. If a fraud operation requires the use of a completely fake doctored video or audio for maximum impact, and it is worth the money and resources, it will be used. However, Nisos researchers have not seen the ability to easily outsource this type of deepfake for single individual or mass production.</p>
<p>Our researchers have contact with a few deepfake channels where we asked about this type of attack vector and participants were unsure something like this would be possible in the near future. The central issue with audio deepfakes has to do with capturing not only the person’s tone but also specific speech mannerisms. Future scenarios will likely materialize, however, where tools similar to a Yandex reverse image search (but for voice) could be used to gather numerous samples and then build and train a model that could help convert the source voice into the target voice.</p>

<p><strong>What Can Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>The most immediate action an employee can take, if they sense something suspicious in a voicemail (or any audio) instruction, is to call the person back directly using a known number and get them on the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake technology is not sophisticated enough to mimic an entire phone call with someone. Additionally, the company can exercise a series of ‘challenge questions’ using information that is not publicly known or conversation points that an actor could not readily answer, to vet the identity of the individual on the line.</p>
<p>This fraud scheme is a form of a business email compromise (a more sophisticated and AI-developed version) where typically the attacker will pretend to be a senior executive at a company and get a more susceptible ‘lower-level’ employee to send money to a bank account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would anticipate a deepfake audio would be the first step in a series of social engineering attempts to get an employee to wire money to a specific location. Phishing emails, additional phone calls, or even deepfake videos purporting to authorize an action could be used in furtherance of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deepfake audio may also be used for reasons ancillary to the ones listed above. For example, criminals can leave fake messages instructing employees to provide network or physical access to the company, allowing attackers to easily compromise the network or physical assets of the company.</p>
<p>The availability of this nascent but rapidly-emerging technology emphasizes the criticality with which companies must develop security practices that encompass these measures. Any time an unusual incident occurs, and certainly when large financial transactions are involved, employees should be trained to ask challenge questions to senior executives.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for a first-time manager to get a single direct report. Try it out. See how it goes. Here’s what this ends up looking like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The new manager is over-reliant on making sure their single report likes them and is doing well. If they give feedback that their manager stinks, that’s 100% bad feedback from your reports. If the report doesn’t do well, that’s 100% of your reports that aren’t succeeding.* If the report quits, you just lost your whole team.</li>
  <li>The manager’s over-reliance on the direct report’s success and happiness leads to risk-averse behavior, like not giving critical feedback or overcompensating. It also regularly leads to micromanagement.</li>
  <li>The single report is isolated. They don’t have any peers on the team to reach out to for help. If their manager is bad, they don’t have any corroborating voices. Anything that goes wrong is a they-said I-said debate. Any debate inside of the team is a faceoff with your manager.</li>
  <li>No one in this relationship has the ability to get context. With more reports, a manager gets clearer signals when they’re wrong. A report could look to teammates to corroborate or dissuade their ideas. With one report, disagreements have little additional evidence, so people have to either approach the situation with a supreme lack of ego, or they can just assume it’s the other person’s fault. Guess which option happens most.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further the problematic conditions, the single report will often be a very junior hire. This compounds the issue. Straight-from-college hires don’t have great context for what it means to be in industry, to have a manager, to work a job with no end-of-semester in sight. And hires aren’t expected to have as much autonomy in their formative early years. With these variables, the requirements on the manager are higher than average.</p>

<p>It’s not uncommon for these relationships to turn sour. The manager makes mistakes as they always do. The report makes mistakes as they always do. Fingers are pointed. Times are dire. If you ever hear someone call their manager a “first-time manager”, you know the relationship has reached a special level of hell.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, consider doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid having first time managers have a team of 1 individual contributor for a prolonged amount of time. That team size is an <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/06/21/goldilocks-management-structure.html">anti-pattern</a> for more reasons than just this one.</li>
  <li>Try and make sure the manager of a team with 1 individual contributor is also an expert in the domain area. Sometimes managers are explicitly not the domain expert by design, but when you have 1 report, a lack of domain expertise is one of the sure-fire ways to make mistakes and a sure-fire way for your report to get the idea that you’re no good.</li>
  <li>Avoid at all costs the combination of: new manager, 1 report, report is new-to-industry, manager is not a subject-matter expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Note: mangers should be very invested in their report’s success. But when the manager is <em>over-invested</em> it leads to all sorts of unsavory things, some of which are called out above. Another example is when a report is doing well-enough, but because the manager is <em>over-reliant</em> on their performance, they try to push the report beyond what they can or want to do.</p>

<p>In today’s post we’re going to talk about latencies in a common distributed
system architecture: The root-leaf, or parent-child, fanout architecture. We’ll
try to gain an intuition for what drives tail latency, derive a formula for
tying together the parent and child latency distributions, and provide a useful
interactive visualization to help understand tail latency in these systems.</p>

<h3 id="root-leaf-fanout-architecture">Root-Leaf Fanout Architecture</h3>

<p>When dealing with distributed systems, it’s a common pattern to have a root
aggregator node that fans-out requests to many leaf nodes that do work in
parallel, then send back their response to the root node to aggregate and
create a final response. Usually the API of the system is exposed through the
root-aggregator nodes, so the latency of these root nodes is what matters.</p>

<p>As seasoned distributed system developers, we know that latency (and
performance) is a
<a href="https://medium.com/lightstephq/performance-is-a-shape-not-a-number-a3c1a9ae19cc">shape not a number</a>.
What this means is that we shouldn’t concern ourselves solely with what the
average latency of a service is – we care about the full latency distribution
– and at the very least we should care about the tail. Usually people settle on
monitoring the $90^{th}$ or $99^{th}$ percentile (p90 or p99), and maybe use a
heatmap to visualize the whole latency distribution.</p>

<p>In the case of our parent-aggregator and many children setup, if we’re going to
concern ourselves with its p99 latency, it’d be nice to know for a given fanout,
how fast do our children nodes have to be to get a certain p99 parent
latency. This is also useful when debugging, but in reverse. If I see a p95
latency spike for the parent node, what percentile latency on the children nodes
do I need to care about? How does this change with the fanout size?</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-problem">Defining the Problem</h3>

<p>Before we analyze the problem any further, we should first define exactly what
problem we’re analyzing. In its simplest form, the parent-child system has two
defining properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Parent latency for a request is greater than or equal to the max of all the children latencies, since the parent must wait for all child responses.</li>
<li>Child latency inevitably has a long tail.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>These two properties mean that as we fan out to more children, our parent
latency will get worse, because we’re more likely to hit a long tail latency
event. And conversely if we can reduce our fanout or reduce the variance in our
child latency we’ll be able to drive down our overall latency.</p>

<p>What’s not immediately obvious though is the magnitude of the effect of reducing
fanout or improving child latency variance is. To try to gain some
understanding, let’s consider a situation where the child latency follows a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution">log normal distribution</a>
with $\mu = 3$ and $\sigma = 0.2$ and consider the latency distributions of the
child, and parents who fan out to varying number of children per request: 10,
100, 1000.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Now we’ll visualize the reconstructed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function">probability density functions</a>
based on observations from generated data, for both the children and the parents:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-child-parent-pdfs-density-plot.png" title="Density plot of child and parent latency probability density functions"></p>

<p>What’s immediately obvious is that as the fanout increases, the parent latency distribution gets worse and worse, and is dominated by the tail latency of the children. By the time we’re fanning out to 1000 children, the parent latency distribution looks almost completely unrelated to the child latency distribution. While we could have predicted this, hopefully this visualization helps build up our intuition of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="deriving-a-closed-form-solution">Deriving a Closed Form Solution</h3>

<p>We began this adventure trying to answer a question, and now it is time to return to it: <em>What child latency percentile drives a given parent latency percentile?</em></p>

<p>Although the problem is pretty simple, I wrestled with it a bit until a friend
pointed out that you can think of a percentile latency as not describing a point
in the latency distribution but instead as a <em>probability</em> that a request
finishes in a given amount of time. So if the p90 latency is 10ms, we can
reframe this as saying that the probability a request finishes within 10ms is
$90\%$.</p>

<p>When we combine this insight with the fact that a parent request only finishes
once all its children requests finish, we can derive a closed form solution to
our problem.</p>

<p>Since the parent request finishes only after all $N$ children requests finish,
then the probability the parent request finishes in time $t$, is the probability
that all $N$ children finish in time $t$. Assuming all children latencies are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
then we can calculate the parent probability as:</p>

<p>$$
P_{parent\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs} = (P_{child\ finishes\ in\ t\ secs})^N
$$</p>

<p>which when we solve for child latency percentile gives us the following formula:</p>

<p>$$
P_{child} \approx \sqrt[N]{P_{parent}}
$$</p>

<p>Now that we have a formula for our problem, we can begin inspecting some
secnarios. If we cared about the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
and the fanout was to 2 children, then we would need to care about the
$94.86^{th}$ percentile at the children, since $\sqrt{0.9} \approx 0.9486$.</p>

<p>One thing about this formula that can be surprising, is how quickly the child
percentile we have to care about grows as we increase the fanout. Even fanning
out to 20 children, and monitoring the $90^{th}$ percentile latency of the parent,
we need to care about the $99.47^{th}$ percentile latency of the children!</p>

<p>The graph below shows how quickly $50^{th}$, $90^{th}$, and $99^{th}$ parent
percentile latency converges to being driven by the $100^{th}$ percentile child
latency as fanout size grows.</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout"></p>

<p>Here is a zoomed-in view focusing on the $90^{th}$ percentile and above:</p>

<p><img src="https://paulcavallaro.com/images/fanouts-parent-latency-percentile-zoomed.png" title="Graph of Child Percentile Latency vs. # of Children in Fanout Zoomed"></p>

<p>We can see that if we’re monitoring the p90 latency of the parent, by the time we fan out to 10 children, we’ll have to start caring about the p99 latency of the children.</p>

<h3 id="trust-but-verify-and-visualize">Trust, but Verify (and Visualize)</h3>

<p>Although the formula makes sense, and the intuition behind it sounds reasonable<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, I often find it helpful when confronted with a formula to verify its correctness by simulation. So I below is a little simulation and visualization to do just that. <strong>The main spiffiness comes when you hover over a bar in either distribution</strong>, as the visualization will highlight both the percentile in its distribution as well as highlight the corresponding percentile in the other distribution:</p>






<p>The above is an example visualization generated from a generalized tool, simulating 3000 requests to a parent fanning out to 20 children, where the child latency distribution is a log normal distribution with $\mu = 3.4$ and $\sigma = 0.3$. The tool itself is <a href="https://paulcavallaro.com/standalone/fanouts.html">hosted here</a>, and the code is in this <a href="https://github.com/paulcavallaro/fanouts-and-percentiles">github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Now we can use this visualization to confirm our formula empirically. If we hover over the bar that correlates with the p95 latency in the parent distribution, our formula predicts that the child latency it corresponds to should be $\sqrt[20]{0.95} \approx .9974$ or p99.74, which is roughly what I get.</p>

<h3 id="bach-s-fanout-variations">Bach’s Fanout Variations</h3>

<p>While we now have a nice way to reason about and visualize the simplest version
of the problem, there are still many variations that would be useful to understand.</p>

<p>Here are some things we might want to do to our system to improve the overall latency:</p>

<ul>
<li>What happens if we drop the slowest child request?</li>
<li>What happens if we retry the slowest child request if it takes “too long”?</li>
<li>What happens if we send every child request to two children instead and just use the fastest response?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not the first person to think about this, lots of the ideas in this section
are stolen directly from the
<a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub40801">Tail at Scale</a>, as well as things
I’ve observed in the wild.</p>

<p>This is a pretty rich topic, so hopefully in the future I can revisit it and
update the visualization to take account of these subtleties.</p>

<p>The repositories of distributions such as <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> and <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/">Nixpkgs</a> are among the
<a href="https://repology.org/repositories/statistics/newest">largest</a> collections of open source (and some unfree) software. They
are complex systems that connect and organize many interdependent packages.
Interestingly, these systems grow out of the individual design choices of
thousands of contributors but few of them have larger design goals in mind.</p>
<p>Is it possible to capture the large scale features of such a repository in an
image? Are there common design choices of the contributors? Did they lead to
any emergent structure?</p>
<p>Plenty of studies (e.g. <a href="https://www2.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/2008-TOSEM-PowerLaws/html/LSV08.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>, or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have examined these questions
from different viewpoints and for various software ecosystems. In this blog
post I’ll try to shed some light on them from the perspective of Nixpkgs,
mostly with visualizations of its complete dependency graph but also with a
very short examination of its statistical properties (its degree distribution).
But wait, you might think: “visualizing a graph with 50000 nodes and 300000
edges? - All you are going to see is black!“. Well, it turns out that this is
not the case because large scale structures appear when we look at the graph in
the right way.</p>
<h2>An overview of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Before explaining in detail what I did, let’s start with a teaser. Check out
the structure in this fascinating image where each little dot represents a

<p>What looks remotely like the section of a mouse brain actually represents
around 46000 software packages. Each dot in this image corresponds to a
different one, more precisely to a Nix derivation in the Nixpkgs repository.
Each package is invisibly linked to those that it depends on (ingoing
dependencies) or those that depend on it (outgoing dependencies). These
packages are the nodes, and their invisible links the incoming and outgoing
edges of the directed dependency graph of Nixpkgs.</p>
<p>The total number of dependencies that a node has is called the node’s <em>degree</em>.
It is subdivided in the <em>in degree</em> which counts the number of ingoing
dependencies and the <em>out degree</em> which counts the number of outgoing
dependencies. I have colored and sized the nodes in the above image by their in
degree: a brighter larger node means that more derivations depend on it (high
in degree) than on a darker smaller node (low in degree). Size and color are
scaled non-linearly and should only be interpreted qualitatively. We will see
later from the distribution of these degrees why this makes sense.</p>
<p>The graph was laid out and visualized with the program <a href="https://gephi.org/">gephi</a> using a
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679">force simulation algorithm</a> to project each node to a display
positions in the image. This force model consists of attractive and repulsive
forces that drag the nodes into their final positions that you can see in the
image.</p>
<p>The attractive force pulls nodes towards their dependencies. Therefore nodes
with similar dependencies end up close to each other. Looking back at the
image, we see the effect of this force in the form of node clusters with
visible gaps between them. The repulsive force pushes nodes away from
dependencies that have high degree. High degree nodes therefore appear with a
lot of space around them. Low degree nodes, on the other hand, are tightly
packed.</p>
<p>As a final addition, a gravitational force keeps the whole graph together and
squeezes it into roughly circular form. Check out the appendix at the end of
this post for a detailed explanation, including the code and the data that are
required to reproduce this image yourself.</p>
<p>The following image of the dependency graph was laid out in the same way, but
shows the package name of each node explicitly. As before, the package names
are scaled non-linearly with the in degree of the node. The names of the
largest nodes - we’ll call them hub nodes - are well readable but to read the
labels of the smaller nodes you should click on the image and use your browsers
zoom functionality.</p>

<p>Most central to the Nixpkgs repository are the primary hub nodes <em>bash</em> and the
Nix <em>stdenv</em> derivation. Unsurprisingly, most derivations depend on them - at
least at build time - because <em>bash</em> is one of the most commonly used Unix
shells and <em>stdenv</em> is a nix package that groups very fundamental build
dependencies such as GNU make. Both are used as default environments in Nix.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller secondary hub nodes can also be identified:
<em>curl</em> and <em>mirrors-list</em> seem to be central to the upper part of the graph and
indicate that it has something to do with the internet. On the right side,
<em>Python2.7</em> and <em>Python3.6</em> are visible as distinct clusters and grouped around
a central <em>hook</em> derivation that is used by Nix to setup a Python environment.
On the left side, different versions of Perl can be seen. In the bottom, the
Linux library manager tool <em>pkg-config</em> forms a little aura that matches its
importance for the open source ecosystem.</p>
<p>The hub nodes indicate that some clusters in this graph correspond to the
environments of different programming languages. Naturally packages in these
environments will have a common set of dependencies and therefore appear close
to each other in the graph.</p>
<h2>Ego networks: exploring hub node environments</h2>
<p>Let’s dive further into this. A hub node forms a little subgraph together with
its ingoing and outgoing dependencies that is sometimes called its <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/egonet.htm"><em>ego network</em></a>
(this term seems to originate in studies of social networks). In the following
plot, the ego networks of a few selected hub nodes are colored in green. The
corresponding hub node’s name is indicated above each subplot. It illustrates
nicely how clusters form around a compiler, an interpreter or just an important
tool:</p>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>The ego networks confirm our previous intuition that some clusters correspond
to different programming languages. They also provide basic orientation on this
graph. Here is a short description of the different ego networks:</p>
<p>Most of the upper part of the graph is dominated by <em>curl</em>. Closer inspection
shows that most of these derivations are archives such as <em>.tar.gz</em> files or
language specific archives such as <em>.gem</em> files. These archives are downloaded
from the internet before other packages are derived from them. Another large,
but less tightly packed region is the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. It dominates the
bottom of the graph and it is characterized by lots of smaller hub nodes
indicating that <em>pkg-config</em> organizes many packages that are important for
other packages. The ego network of <em>cmake</em> is mixed into a similar region of
the graph.</p>
<p>Python2.7 and Python3.6 form neat clusters with three central hub nodes that
correpond to the python interpreter, the package management tool <em>pip</em>, and the
build and installation tool <em>setuptools</em>. Python2.7 is used more often by
packages outside of its cluster than Python3.6. In contrast to Python, Perl has
only a single hub node for each specific version but it forms similarly dense
clusters. From the different Perl versions, <em>Perl-5.28.0</em> is reused most outside
of its own cluster by a lot of other packages in the <em>pkg-config</em> zone. This
indicates that the specific version of the Nixpkgs repository that I have
evaluated uses this particular Perl version as the default for other packages.</p>
<p>Lisp (sbcl), Haskell (ghc), Ruby, OCaml, Go, and Rust derivations also
accumulate in tight clusters around their respective compiler.</p>
<p>Ego networks can only give a glimpse into the structure of the graph of
Nixpkgs. Not all environments are organized around a central hub. Some packages
are self-contained and independent. For example, the Go
packages form a tight independent group because they <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26217488/what-is-vendoring">often include copies of third party packages that they depend on</a>.
There are also many smaller clusters that correspond to particular tools such
as terraform, maven or even the vim plugins. If you have time and patience, you
can try to find them in the labelled graph image above.</p>
<h2>The degree distribution of the Nixpkgs dependency graph</h2>
<p>Another perspective on the global properties of the Nixpkgs repository is the
degree distribution of its nodes. It shows how many nodes exist with a certain
in or out degree (as a reminder: the in degree is the number of packages that
depend on the node; the out degree is the number of packages that the node
depends on). Certainly there are a lot more nodes with low in degree than with
high in degree. More interesting is how the number of nodes with a
certain degree changes between the extremes.</p>
<p>A whole bunch of studies (for example
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.0087.pdf">here</a>,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0305575.pdf">here</a>) have found that the in degree
distribution of software repository dependencies follows a power-law
distribution, similar to the degree distributions of networks in Geology,
Biology, Economics, or the Internet
(<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/courses/2006/cmplxsys899/powerlaws.pdf">here is a short introduction on power-laws</a>).
Such a power-law distribution can be generated by several mechanisms. The
hottest candidate mechanism in the case of software repositories seems to be
<em>preferential attachment</em>, a.k.a. “the rich get richer”. In other words, a new
package is more likely to depend on existing packages with a lot than on
packages with few dependencies. Other mechanisms such as <em>self-organized criticality</em>
<a href="https://sail.cs.queensu.ca/Downloads/ICSM-ICSME2007_EmpiricalEvidenceForSOCDynamicsInSoftwareEvolution.pdf">might also play a role</a>.</p>
<p>The (complementary) cumulative in and out degree distributions show how many
packages exist above a certain degree. Looking at the cumulative distribution
is typically better than looking at its derivative, the degree distribution. As
an integral, the cumulative distribution has a better behavior when the density
of packages gets low at high degrees. We plot it here for the in and
out degrees in log-log scale such that a power-law is just a straight line:</p>

<p>The cumulative in degree distribution is a very clean power-law decay with an
exponent of -0.9. The in degree distribution itself has an exponent of -1.9,
because it is the derivative of the cumulative distribution. The value that we
observe falls in the range of values that have been …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>© 2020 Paolo Melchiorre <i>"Photo of Paolo Melchiorre speaking at EuroPython 2020 Online Edition"</i></p><div>
<p>Yesterday I gave a talk at the EuroPython 2020 Online Edition with title <a href="https://www.paulox.net/2020/07/23/europython-2020/#europython-2020/">“A pythonic full-text search”</a> which is now available here on my&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p><em>In the last few years I gave a lot of talks in various tech conferences in Europe, but it was my first talk in an online conference, so I decided to share some thoughts about this&nbsp;experience.</em></p>
<p>The EuroPython team did a great job organizing everything. They made a list of tips and a complete guide for speakers that I suggest, to organizers and speakers of other conferences, to&nbsp;read.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/europython-2020-social-online-card.jpg" title="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020" alt="Tips for Speakers — EuroPython 2020 Online · 23-26 July 2020"></p>
<p>ep2020.europython.eu/events/tips/</p>

<p>Besides reading the guide and attending the rehearsal session, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to have a good setup. I copied from other conference speakers, and to have a working virtual background in zoom, I used my two external monitors as light&nbsp;panels.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-00.jpg"></p>
<p>Attending an online conference is a new experience , but giving a talk remotely is way more strange than in a regular conference. There’s nobody around to speak with, smiles at or asking to take a picture, so I shoot by myself some pictures of me during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-01.jpg"></p>
<p>At the same time, I was able to capture some screenshots of myself giving the talk from the live Youtube channel, so I have a picture of me from the other side of the screen in the exact moment of the above&nbsp;picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-02.png"></p>
<p>In the speakers guide there was this suggestion: “Throw in some jokes. Even bad jokes. Even a really bad pun.”. I tried to make a joke about synchronization problems in full-text search, a very dangerous thing to do, but here I’m laughing at my own joke during the&nbsp;talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-03.png"></p>
<p>Another suggestion from the organizers was to use “Pictures instead of bullet points in slides. Pictures are great. Everyone loves cats.” so I&nbsp;used:</p>
<ul>
<li>an elephant (the logo of&nbsp;PostgreSQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-04.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a famous guitaris (Django Reinhardt from whom the Django web framework takes its&nbsp;name)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-05.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>some&nbsp;books</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-07.jpg"></p>
<ul>
<li>a picture of me at EuroPython 2017 during the sprint on&nbsp;Django</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-06.jpg"></p>
<p>In an online conference people are more interactive and free to do other things watching your talk, so I published in advance a post on my blog with the slides and other information about the talk, and I shared a <span>QR</span>-code linked to it and also all my other&nbsp;contacts.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-08.png"></p>
<p>Giving online talks is a stressful thing, but answering questions is way more difficult, you are not able to see who is asking the question and its expression. In these pictures I was at the end of the talk after a few questions, waiting for an&nbsp;applause.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-09.jpg"></p>
<p>This was my first time giving a talk in an online conference, it was a very challenging experience but I enjoyed it. I learnt a lot of new stuff, also how to take a picture of myself after the talk, to share it&nbsp;online.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.paulox.net/images/20200724-10.jpg"></p>
<p>I’ll gave other talks this year, I listed them on my talks&nbsp;page:</p>

<p><strong>See you at the next&nbsp;conference!</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                
    <span>Jul 2020</span>

    

    <p>Letâ€™s just skip the intro and get to the good stuff. Mmkay? Kay.</p>
<h2>1) Move â€œFind Allâ€� To The Bottom</h2>
<p>When you hit <em>Cmd+Shift+F</em> VS Codeâ€™s â€œFind Allâ€� panel shows up.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a super powerful feature. Itâ€™s one of the niceties that originally drew me away from Sublime Text in the first place.</p>
<p>WHY IN THE WORLD IS IT SCRUNCHED IN THE SIDEBAR!!??!</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1470600526.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The bottom panel thingy (where the terminal sits) is a much better place for â€œSearchâ€�.</p>
<p>This actually used to be the default in VS Code, and there was a setting to customize it yourself.</p>
<p>Now, they changed the default AND they removed the setting completely.</p>
<p>What are we to do?</p>
<p>Welp, turns out you can just drag it. Take a gander:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1353159485.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>There we go. One annoyance down. Four to go.</p>
<h2>2) Better New Window Sizing</h2>
<p>This one might just be me, but when I open a new VS Code window, I expect it to be the same size as the previously opened one.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window in VS Code looks like with an existing window already opened by default:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3312027563.png" alt="">
Now, admittedly, this actually looks kind of cool, but nonetheless, it would make so much more sense if VS Code just used the last known window size as a reference.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we can add the following configuration to our <em>settings.json</em> file.</p>
<p>To open <em>settings.json</em>, search for â€œsettings jsonâ€� in the command palette (<em>Cmd+Shift+P</em>):
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3815150.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, you can add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "inherit",</code></pre>
<p>Hereâ€™s what opening a new window will look like now:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/3355376318.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You might also prefer to keep the same dimensions, but â€œoffsetâ€� the new window. You can do that with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"window.newWindowDimensions": "offset",</code></pre>
<p>Now, the new window will be â€œoffsetâ€�:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/32369233.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>3) Snippet Suggestions At The Top</h2>
<p>Snippets in VS Code are a powerful way to auto-fill repetitive boilerplate text. If you donâ€™t already use them, you can read more about them <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets">here</a>.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but if I registered a trigger for a snippet, I want to see that snippet at the top of my autocomplete list. Otherwise, SNIPPETS ARE USELESS.</p>
<p>Snippets have to be fast and easy to trigger, and out of the box THEY ARE NOT.</p>
<p>Take the following example GIF of a <code>console.log</code> snippet with a trigger of <code>con</code>.</p>
<p>When I type <code>con</code> I should be able to hit <em>Enter</em> and fill <code>console.log</code>.
This is not the case: </p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2858044731.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>To remedy this, we can add a new setting to our <em>settings.json</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I type <code>con</code>, my suggestions are more sensible:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/4146687846.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh, VS Codeâ€¦</p>
<h2>4) GitHub-Style Inline Diffs</h2>
<p>I LOVE VS Codeâ€™s diff viewer.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s a great way to get a glimpse of your changes before a commit, or easily resolve a merge conflict.</p>
<p>However, the default diff viewer is â€œSide by Sideâ€�. Meaning there are two panels with two different versions of the same file open side by side:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/595731340.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I much prefer the way GitHub renders diffs inline:</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1762674115.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can easily achieve this in VS Code with the following setting:</p>
<pre><code>"diffEditor.renderSideBySide": false,</code></pre>
<p>Now take a look at the diff editor in VS Code:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/2616479419.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Wehoo, love it ðŸ‘ŒðŸ�»</p>
<h2>5) Disable â€œPeekâ€� Previews</h2>
<p>Previews panels in VS Code are the most annoying thing ever.</p>
<p>So ugly and so useless.</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever wanted to see a tiny preview of a file instead of just viewing the file itself. The previews are always too constrained anyways.</p>
<p>Look at this horribleness:
<img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/597353947.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With a few settings we can improve our world and never see those disgusting things again!</p>
<pre><code>"editor.gotoLocation.multipleReferences": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDefinitions": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleDeclarations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleImplementations": "goto",
"editor.gotoLocation.multipleTypeDefinitions": "goto",</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go, now we will actually go to the file itself right away. Much better.</p>
<p><img src="https://calebporzio.com/post_images/1392694127.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>VS Code has so many powerful features. Iâ€™m a happy user of it. However, there are lots of tiny little details it gets wrong.</p>
<p>If you dig these short little tips, I have an entire course FULL of them.</p>
<p>In the course, weâ€™ll completely overhaul your VS Code workflow and make you fast and efficient. Along the way weâ€™ll also make VS Code look and behave better.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>These days I turn to <a href="https://sharpend.io/recreational-programming-with-serverless/">recreational programming</a> more often than usual. Solving fun problems makes me feel less confused and helpless about the pandemic. It’s a coping mechanism and a good one at that.</p>

<p>One thing has been an especially surprising source of joy for me: <em>Rust</em>. Surprising because I’ve been known to have an on-off relationship with the programming language since its 1.0 release. I quit Rust more than once – both professionally and personally – mainly out of frustration with a subpar development experience and general lack of libraries.</p>

<p>Looking back, I’m thrilled that I gave Rust another chance this year.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-then">That was then</h2>

<p>Back in 2017, <a href="https://sharpend.io/every-day-we-must-sweep/">I wrote</a> that “Rust lets you control almost everything, but as a beginner, it’s also hard to compile <em>anything</em>. As a result, Rust continues to make me look bad.” I was disappointed. Again.</p>

<p>At the time, I was working for a chaos engineering startup that chose Rust for simulating common server problems such as high CPU load, increased network latency, or random application crashes. A reasonable choice if your goal is to inject low-level faults in a predictable way, right? After all, Rust is said to be <a href="https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/">our best chance at safe systems programming</a>. That may very well be true.</p>

<p>However, back then, I didn’t think Rust was the best option for the client side of the product. The main reason was productivity – or rather the lack thereof.</p>

<p>In 2017, my day-to-day Rust experience boiled down to the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing code in Vim with bare-bones syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>No code completion and no “go to definition” (the Rust Language Server was still in its infancy)</li>
  <li>Effectively no code formatting, since <code>rustfmt</code> just gave up whenever a line was too long (seriously)</li>
  <li>Docs were hard to find or non-existent</li>
  <li>The same goes for high-quality code examples</li>
  <li>No official Rust Docker images, homegrown CI pipelines only</li>
  <li>Compile times were noticeably slow, resulting in long <a href="https://sharpend.io/fast-feedback-is-everything/">feedback loops</a></li>
  <li>Speaking of feedback, Rust’s borrow checker made it difficult to understand why it rejected a piece of code and how to fix it</li>
</ul>

<p>All these drawbacks add up, but what really bothered me was the immature crate ecosystem. To give you one example, when we implemented the ability to inject faults into containers, we couldn’t find any usable Rust client library to talk to the Docker API, let alone Kubernetes. As a result, we were forced to reinvent the wheel several times (and sometimes ended up with a flat tire, in typical startup fashion).</p>

<p>In the face of these obstacles and despite my appreciation for its language design, I often found it challenging to get real work done with Rust.</p>

<p>At least, that was then.</p>

<p><img src="https://sharpend.io/assets/images/rust-gegenueber.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="this-is-now">This is now</h2>

<p>Today, three years later, I’m happy to report that <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/05/15/five-years-of-rust.html">Rust has changed a lot</a>, and for the better! That became apparent to me when I recently had some extra time between freelance contracts and decided to <a href="https://sharpend.io/7-things-i-learned-from-porting-a-c-crypto-library-to-rust/">port a crypto library from C to Rust</a> (because that’s what I do to get out of the cloud consulting bubble once in a while).</p>

<p>I realized that the release of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html">2018 edition</a> is particularly noteworthy. It made the language much more productive in several ways: simpler syntax, a smarter borrow-checker, an improved module system, enhanced tooling (both <code>rustfmt</code> and Clippy, Rust’s linter, hitting 1.0), and a host of other features. Add to that IDE support, incremental compilation, excellent documentation, and immensely helpful error messages, and what you now get is nothing short of remarkable.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rust’s soaring popularity – it has been <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/">Stack Overflow’s most loved language</a> for four years in a row – finding a particular crate or tool has become easier (though still not necessarily easy). There are more and more <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">open source projects</a> to explore. There’s a growing list of third-party cargo subcommands (<a href="https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger">cargo-geiger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gnzlbg/cargo-asm">cargo-asm</a> being two of my favorites). There’s even <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">a decent REPL</a>. CI/CD <a href="https://actions-rs.github.io/">is a breeze</a>, and so is <a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross">cross compilation</a> to dozens of platforms. In short, there’s a lot to love here.</p>

<p>Given these advances, it’s no wonder that learning Rust is also quite different now. The tonari blog <a href="https://blog.tonari.no/why-we-love-rust">captured it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year after switching over to Rust, we onboarded our fourth engineer to the team, who didn’t have much prior experience in either Rust or systems engineering. While the learning curve is undeniable (borrow checker, my old friend), we’ve found that Rust is incredibly empowering for those new to lower-level programming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Empowering</em> is the perfect word to describe Rust in 2020. What used to be a rough adventure with many pitfalls has turned into something beautiful, something that can lift your spirit. At least, that’s what it did for me.</p>

<p>I encourage you to immerse yourself in a little Rust project today. You might be in for a pleasant surprise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been a global shift toward data-driven business. But, in many cases, the data just under the surface is dirty, and it’s failing modern companies.</p><p>In their<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/white-papers/2020-global-data-management-research.pdf"> <em>2020 Global data management research</em></a> report, Experian estimated that many businesses aiming for agile, data-driven approaches believe almost a third of their data to be inaccurate.</p><blockquote><em>“While the business wants to be agile and informed by data, this level of distrusted data often leads leaders to fall back on making decisions by gut instinct rather than by informed data insight.” Experian Global Managing Director of Data Quality Mike Kilander</em></blockquote><p>That doesn’t just mean a large chunk of the data the companies have isn’t working for them. It means their data is working <em>against </em>them—costing them money, frustrating their employees, and getting in the way of opportunities.</p><p>If you don’t take an active role in your data governance, your dirty data will snowball, picking up crud as it rolls forward. If left uncleaned, it can tarnish up to<a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64612-the-cost-of-bad-data-stats"> 70% of your data after one year</a>. This data erosion will directly impact your bottom line--as it does for<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 83% of companies</a>--and cost you an average of<a href="https://www.edq.com/globalassets/uk/papers/global-research-2015_20pp-ext-apr15.pdf"> 23% of your revenue</a>.</p><p>Mature data governance is no longer a wish list item for modern companies. It’s table stakes, so much so that, according to the<a href="https://go.profisee.com/2019-state-of-data-management-report"> 2019 State of Data Management Report</a>, governance is one of the top five strategic initiatives for global companies.</p><p>To stop throwing your time and money out the window and make your data clean up and grow up, you need a mature, enterprise-wide data governance model.</p><p>These maturity models help companies ensure the data in their system is accurate, well understood, and supported by employees with the skill sets needed to turn numbers into narrative.</p><h2><strong>What Exactly Is Data Governance Maturity and Why Should You Care?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity refers to the level of data management process and optimization you have built into your business.</p><p>At a company with mature data governance, clean and formal data management is at the core of everything they do. Each employee, team lead, and department knows the best practices they’re supposed to follow, and the company’s projects are regularly measured and optimized using the data produced. This gold standard of a data-driven company actively optimizes its processes using the <strong>three main components of data governance:</strong></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Rules </strong>that dictate the creation and maintenance of data</li><li><strong>Enforcement </strong>that outlines how you ensure rules are followed throughout the company</li><li><strong>Management </strong>practices that are carried out by data stewards and employees in accordance with enforcement</li></ol><p>In its infancy, data governance maturity looks like reactive data management, ad-hoc data practices, a lack of formally defined best practices, and a kind of free-for-all approach to how data is collected, cleaned, and pruned. In short: it looks like chaos, where data is a byproduct of your company instead of the fuel behind its actions.</p><p>If you aren’t taking a proactive role in your data governance by measuring its maturity, you’re letting an information toddler run through an operational china shop—a dirty-data toddler that can wreck your company, leaving errors, inconsistencies, and security risks in its path.</p><p><em>“Poor data is often entangling entire organizations with crippling effects, preventing timely decision-making and negatively impacting customer experience.” — Experian 2020 Global data management research report</em></p><p>However, there’s no “one size fits all” approach to data governance, so you’ll have to work with your leaders and systems architects to tailor the framework that fits your use case and goals.</p><h2><strong>Which Data Governance Maturity Models Should You Use?</strong></h2><p>Data governance maturity models help you measure and understand how well you manage your data. When you have a clear understanding of your data governance, you’re better able to understand how you are or are not meeting goals, what steps you need to take to improve data management overall, and how you need to tailor data approaches to each team and project.</p><p>There are almost as many data governance maturity models as there are use cases for data. If you already use a maturity model to measure your data capabilities, it’s best to adjust that framework and apply it to your data governance to keep things consistent.</p><p>If, however, you’re starting from the ground level, you can choose from one of the many maturity assessments published by reputable vendors, each of which features a slightly different emphasis:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ii/whitepaper/LIW14003USEN.pdf"><strong>IBM</strong></a><strong> &amp;</strong><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/bg/en/pages/technology/articles/Data-management-maturity-self-assessment.html"><strong> Deloitte</strong></a> focus on process characterization across projects and enterprise levels and use the CMMI Institute’s Data Management Maturity (DMM) model.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-dataflux/"><strong>DataFlux</strong></a> focuses on people, risk, process, reward, technology adoption, and business capabilities.</li><li><a href="https://dattamza.org/dattamza-blog/data-governance-and-the-maturity-assessment-model"><strong>Dattamza</strong></a> focuses on process, technology capabilities, managed risk, financials, and people management.</li><li><a href="https://edmcouncil.org/page/aboutdcamreview"><strong>EDM Council</strong></a> focuses on the maturity of an organization’s structure, its policies and guidelines, and funding.</li><li><a href="https://www.lightsondata.com/data-governance-maturity-models-kalido/"><strong>Kalido</strong></a><strong> </strong>focuses on the value of data as an enterprise asset and the risks and rewards of how it’s managed.</li></ul><p>All of the above feature some version of the level 1-5 system to rate the development stage of a company’s data governance.</p><p>For this article, we’ll focus on the IBM model, as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework that underpins it is one of the most popular—and oldest—ways of thinking about data governance maturity.</p><p>The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) was developed in 2006 by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University based on the earlier Capability Maturity Model (CMM). The CMM was originally developed to improve software dev processes, and its successor took its original principles and made them more broadly applicable to any enterprise using data.</p><h2><strong>IBM Data Governance Maturity Model</strong></h2><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model is one of the most widely used models around for measuring the maturity of data governance. Drawing from the creation of the CMMI in 2006, IBM released this model in 2007 to provide a clear, easy-to-understand, and tailored framework for measuring data maturity.</p><p>The IBM Data Governance Maturity Model focuses on measuring 11 domains—such as value creation, policy, stewardship, information lifecycle management, and data architecture—using a maturity scale of 1-5. Most companies start out by focusing on the handful that are most relevant and important to them and then building out as their core domains become more mature.</p><h3><strong>The 5 levels of maturity</strong></h3><p>For each domain a company focuses on, the IBM Data Governance Maturity Model outlines five levels of maturity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec440af46599341a9a10225/5f0630497ff87413654faabe_T2hZFW0T8EQNecms1z_IAs21zOeWR0GH86WjVAcxXzg-5mPW3etCgX8mjOkAIZGTVKtdKlIbEwbztZ2aF1lXTEDJcd_dMEwru420NjwMZ1UaX4iU1uOXYPHzNJLBv_GgN255gqOL.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Below, we’ll take a look at what exactly maturity at each level means and how you can level up to the next stage based on your current data governance practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 1: Initial</strong></h3><p>Companies with level 1 data governance have little to no data management processes in place, are reactive to data management, and have no formalized tracking plan.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: In order to move beyond level 1, system architects should audit information flow and develop a plan for managing it with stakeholders and IT managers.</p><h3><strong>Level 2: Managed</strong></h3><p>Companies that achieve level 2 data governance have slightly more processes in place, some automation integrated, and more awareness of data. This is where most companies start their data governance journey.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: To upgrade your data governance maturity to level 3, focus on developing data regulation and documentation guidelines. Your system architects should begin to do this by building models of core infrastructure and documentation needs.</p><h3><strong>Level 3: Defined</strong></h3><p>Level 3 data governance means that there are some defined policies in place, you’re regularly leveraging technology for data management, you’ve developed a road map for integrating data, and best practices are more widely understood across the company.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel: </strong>As you move into level 4, continue to implement data stewardship by assigning and implementing policies and rules of data management. This policy framework will underpin regular risk assessments and help you create a central program for educating teams on data best practices.</p><h3><strong>Level 4: Quantitatively Managed</strong></h3><p>By level 4, your company should have a clear, enterprise-wide data governance structure with projects that follow your set rules and principles and models that are well documented and regularly reviewed. You should have a well-defined policy framework that outlines frequent risk assessments and methods for educating enterprise teams on the company’s data management best practices.</p><p><strong>How to Uplevel</strong>: Now that your framework has been created and implemented, focus on defining and setting performance measurement metrics for each process. To do this, create a plan for maintaining data models and check that each project follows your data best practices to avoid dirtying data down the line.</p><h3><strong>Level 5: Optimizing</strong></h3><p>Level 5 is the holy grail of data governance. 🏆 At this point, data governance should be streamlined, and processes should be automated. Data governance is at the core of how you do business.</p><p>This means that data governance is no longer an afterthought or detour on the way to how you do business. Instead, all teams and employees should know how to follow data best practices, and every project you do should follow these rules and principles to create and utilize clean data.</p><p>Since this is the ultimate level of data governance, there is no upleveling from here. Instead, if you reach level 5, focus on continuously measuring and analyzing ROI for all projects, so you keep your data integrity.</p><h2><strong>Make Better Decisions with Better Data</strong></h2><p>Your data governance is only as mature as the data underneath it is good. To become truly data-driven, you must ensure you have a single, high-quality source of truth to work with.</p><p>Avo helps you create this single source of truth and make the right data-driven decisions to move your business by allowing you to prioritize, inspect, analyze, and future-proof your tracking to create reliable data now …</p></div></div>

  <div id="double-entry-accounting-for-developers">

<p>Hordak is inherently aimed at software developers as it provides core
functionality only. Friendly interfaces can certainly be built on top of it, but
if you are here there is a good chance you are a developer.</p>
<p>If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that
most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer/STEM mindset. I
therefore provide some resources here that may be of use.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>According to this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23964513">Hacker News discussion</a>, some of what follows may be either incorrect
or abhorrent to those with a good knowledge of accounting practices. I still
feel the following is useful, and that taken as a whole it describes a working
double entry accounting system.</p>
</div>

<div id="in-a-little-more-detail">
<h2>In a little more detail<a href="#in-a-little-more-detail" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/accounting/tutorial.html">Peter Selinger’s tutorial</a> to be very enlightening and is less terse than the functional description above.
The first section is short and covers single entry accounting, and then shows how one can expand that to create double
entry accounting. I found this background useful.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You live in a shared house. Everyone pays their share into a communal bank account
every month.</p>
<div id="example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 1: Saving money to pay a bill (no sign flipping)<a href="#example-1-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-no-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You pay the electricity bill every three months. Therefore every month you take £100
from everyone’s contributions and put it into Electricity Payable account (a liability
account) in the knowledge that you will pay the bill from this account when it eventually arrives:</p>
<p>These accounts are income &amp; liability accounts, so neither balance needs to be flipped (flipping
only applies to asset &amp; expense accounts). Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £500</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction</strong>:<ul>
<li>£100 from <em>Housemate Contribution</em> to <em>Electricity Payable</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balances after:<ul>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £400</li>
<li><em>Electricity Payable</em> (liability): £100</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This should also make intuitive sense. Some of the housemate contributions will be used to pay the electricity
bill, therefore the former decreases and the latter increases.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping">
<h3>Example 2: Saving money to pay a bill (with sign flipping)<a href="#example-2-saving-money-to-pay-a-bill-with-sign-flipping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the start of every month each housemate pays into the communal bank account. We
should therefore represent this somehow in our double entry system (something we ignored in
example 1).</p>
<p>We have an account called <em>Bank</em> which is an asset account (because this is money
we actually have). We also have a <em>Housemate Contribution</em> account which is an
income account.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>to represent the fact that we have been paid money, we must create a transaction</strong>.
However, money cannot be injected from outside our double entry system, so how do we deal with this?</p>
<p>Let’s show how we represent a single housemate’s payment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balances before:<ul>
<li><em>Bank</em> (asset): £0</li>
<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em> (income): £0</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Transaction:</strong><ul>
<li>£500 from <em>Bank</em> to <em>Housemate Contribution</em></li>

<li><em>Housemate Contribution</em>  (income): £500</li>

<p>Because the bank account is an asset account, we flip the sign of its balance.
<strong>The result is that both accounts increase in value.</strong></p>

Yes, a lot! As developers, we’re continually writing code, and we do that by passing messages. Each message carries a lot of context and semantics. Therefore we’re always evolving how to do it in a better way.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">There is this vastly known anecdote that says that there are only&nbsp;</span><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">two hard things in Computer Science</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: caching invalidation and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">naming</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;things.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Terminology is in the roots of communication, and therefore is as vital for writing quality code as writing User Stories, documentation, and even naming branches.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you care a lot about communicating effectively, I think we must use an&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">inclusive language</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to do so.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inclusive writing is the usage of the language with neutrality. Inclusiveness has a positive impact on our lives, as they don’t offend interlocutors based on abilities/disabilities, age, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, religion, etc.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It would be best to read</span> <a href="https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">this content guide</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that describes how to be more inclusive when writing. The impact of fostering more inclusive writing implies changes in how we write software. Besides, sooner or later, we see that it affects many aspects of everyday life communication. 🌱</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some time ago,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/4/229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a proposal</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;regarding the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch name in </span><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/tag/git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Git</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> came up. I got pleased that the concern of an inclusive language arrived in the <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/category/development-tools">tool I use every day for development</a>. The proposal addresses replacing the master branch name by a more inclusive one, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=49decddd39e5f6132ccd7d9fdc3d7c470b0061bb">such as <code>main</code>, <code>primary</code>, or <code>principal</code></a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">At SourceLevel, we have opted for using <code>main</code>&nbsp;as the default branch name. Did you know you can change the default branch in your Git repositories? You can do it by both </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitLab</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project Settings &gt; Repository</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GitHub</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Repository Settings &gt; Branches</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the default branch of your repositories may break some tools. In the case of SourceLevel, we already support the custom default branch, and it synchronizes with GitHub and GitLab. Changing on those tools automatically replicates in our tool.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Steps for changing your default branch</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the examples below, I rename the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to <code>main</code>. You should discuss with your team and find the name that better suits you.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, we need to rename it locally:</span></p>
<pre><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git branch -m master main
</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">$ git push origin main -u</span></pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And you’re done! These two commands rename your local <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch and then push it to the remote server. It’s a secure way to start, once the commands don’t delete the remote <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note that after changing the name to main, everyone who clones the repository gets the new default branch set. However, people who had previously cloned the repository are still pointing to the master branch.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To move forward with the change, everyone in your team needs to run a <a href="https://twitter.com/xunit/status/1269881005877256192">few commands</a>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For a complete guide, I strongly recommend reading </span><a href="https://dev.to/damcosset/replacing-master-in-git-2jim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Damien Cosset’s blog post</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using SourceLevel as an Inclusive Language watchdog</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Now that we have a more inclusive branch name, there may be references to other terms that we should avoid. They may appear in variables, methods, or even comments.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, we need to look for them the whole codebase. This part can demand lots of hard work, depending on the size and terminology used throughout codebases.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changing the existing code doesn’t prevent you or your team from using exclusive language again. What if a bot could notify you when a contravention appears? You can use the <a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/grep/"><code>grep</code> linter </a></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">as a watchdog!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Configure your <code>.sourcelevel.yml</code> file adding rules that look for exclusive language and suggest more appropriate terms for each Pull or Merge Requests using SourceLevel’s <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/automated-code-review">automated code review</a> feature. It should look something like this:</span></p>
<pre>engines:
  grep:
    config:
      patterns:
        allowlist:
          pattern: "/white[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Whitelist'. Prefer the term 'Allowlist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
        blocklist:
          pattern: "/black[_\\-]?list/i"
          annotation: Do not use 'Blacklist'. Prefer the term 'Blocklist'
          categories: Style
          path_patterns:
          - "**/*.ex"
          - "**/*.exs"
    enabled: true</pre>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After pushing it to the main branch, SourceLevel can help you achieve a more inclusive language throughout the codebase!</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In short</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Using an inclusive language is crucial for fostering a diverse culture. Git has changed the naming conventions to be more language-inclusive, and so you should change. Our development tools, like GitHub and GitLab, already supports the change.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SourceLevel deals very nicely with repositories that changed the <code>master</code>&nbsp;branch to a more appropriate word. Besides, you can use the <code>grep</code>&nbsp;linter the look for exclusive terms contained in the source code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the inclusive language gap may happen in other aspects of our lives, have you already thought about them?</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raise the discussion in your team and use the tools to favor a more inclusive world 💚!</span></p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Approximately a week ago, I started on the journey to rebuild one of my side projects in Node.js. It was originally built in asp.net core mvc. There was nothing wrong with how it was built, it wasn't misbehaving or anything like that, but I needed to make some changes, add a feature that has been requested dozens of times now, and the code base was stale and packages needed updating, etc.</p>
<p>So I opened the project in Visual Studio, and started re-familiarizing myself with the codebase. After an hour it was painfully clear, I wasn't going to add any more code to this project, at least not as it currently existed. So I decided to just do a Node/Express/MongoDB application since it was already using MongoDB for it's backend.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-hours-later">A Few Hours Later</h3>
<p>I was exhausted. I tried to do everything the right way, the way my code-forefathers would have expected, but the code was starting to pile up, and I hadn't even rendered the homepage yet. It made me miss the days of just creating an index.php page and shit just rendering. The amount of boilerplate code I was writing was getting very annoying, so I decided that THIS is the project I was going to tackle first.</p>
<p>I contemplated code generation for the boilerplate, but that is fraught with edge cases and constantly needing to be tweaked. Then I thought, why not just abstract it all away in a tiny package, and get it out of my way so I can just build my routes and my views, but also make it feel more like the asp.net mvc world I come from.</p>
<h3 id="a-new-web-framework-is-born">A new web framework is born</h3>
<p>I decided to follow a little bit of the MVC pattern, or at least the pattern than asp.net mvc tutorials have always followed, which is more like Controllers, Views, View-Models, but Microsoft can call that MVC, I will call my web framework MVC as well.</p>
<p>The basic concept is the library sets up everything you could need (so long as what you need is MongoDB, sessions, and mustache for views), and then it gets out of your way for you to create your Controllers (which is really just a route handler with some nice helper methods) anyway you wish (all in one file, highly structured, it doesn't matter to SimpleMVC.js).</p>
<p>The first project I decided to build with the framework was a little example blog. Total code is around 45 lines (excluding the JSON data source), and for about 20 more lines, you could have blog backed by a MongoDB collection, or even straight from the file system. In fact, this blog is built using SimpleMVC.js, and the code including admin and supporting comments (though I have them turned off) is under 200 lines.</p>
<p>You can see the sample blog in <a href="https://github.com/jeremyaboyd/simplemvcjs/tree/master/examples/simpleblog">the repository</a>, and you can use that to get started. I'm still writing the full documentation, but it is a pretty simple framework to get started with. You can install it <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplemvcjs">from npm today</a>, but it is <strong>still a beta</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-it">Why use it?</h3>
<p>SimpleMVC.js was made to get you setup quickly to start building your next web application in a structured way without all the excess boilerplate that typically comes with an MVC project in other frameworks.</p>
<p>The framework has 4 built in classes.</p>
<ol>
<li>SimpleMVC.App - the main service, this is what runs your application</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.Controller - this is a class you will new up for every set of routes you want to use</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.Membership - this service has a handful of helper methods for CRUDing users and their profiles</li>
<li>SimpleMVC.SMTP - this service is basically just a wrapper for a preconfigured <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer">nodemailer</a> transport</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hello-world">Hello World</h4>
<p>As is typical with all new libraries, here is Hello World:</p>
<pre><code>const SimpleMVC = require('simplemvcjs');

const homeController = new SimpleMVC.Controller("/", {
    "": function() {
        return this.content("hello world");
    }
});

const app = new SimpleMVC.App();
app.initDbConnection();
app.addControllers(homeController);
app.listen();</code></pre>
<p>The code can get more complicated from here, but it doesn't have to. A simple dynamic website that doesn't need much user interaction, can really be only a few routes and a database lookup.</p>
<h3 id="where-it-goes-from-here">Where it goes from here</h3>
<p>I have a handful of additional helper methods I want to add to the Controller class, along with supporting all of the HTTP verbs (it currently only supports POST and GET), and then I'd like to finish the Example SaaS project which will use all of the features of the framework, and can be used as a testbed for further development.</p>

    <p>You know what really sucks? Breaking bones. I’d been watching too many mountain biking videos on YouTube and after the first jump on a ride at my local bike trails, I came to realise that my enthusiasm and confidence far outweighed my skill. After over-jumping the jump, hitting a tree, flying over the bars and landing directly on my left shoulder 4 metres down the trail, I now have a broken clavicle (collar bone).</p>

<p>Living in the UK, we have public health care, so my brother drove me straight to Accident and Emergency. An x-ray soon confirmed that I’d snapped my collar bone in two, but apparently there’s not very much to be done. They gave me a sling, told me I’d need to take some pain killers for a few days, and booked me in at the fracture clinic for the following day. At the fracture clinic I go through the x-rays with a specialist doctor while he tells me about the next ten weeks of my life are going to be like. At this point I can barely move my arm. My shoulder’s the size of a water melon and turning yellow. Ten weeks like this. Shit.</p>

<p>I work as a software developer. Mainly ASP.NET and C# stuff. This means I live in Visual Studio… all day, everyday. Have you ever tried to work in VS one handed? Give it a try. It can be done but it’s not easy. One of the hardest things are keyboard shortcuts. Alt+Enter especially. I’ve got big hands, but even I struggle with that one using only my right hand. Luckily most functionality is available through context menus or through other parts of the UI.</p>

<p>A fantastic thing about VS is that nearly all keyboard shortcuts are remappable. I’d never thought of this as an accessibility feature before, but it really is. I’ve resisted changing anymore keyboard shortcuts than strictly necessary, as I’m intending to start using both arms again one day, but it’s fantastic that this is available in a tool that I rely on to work and pay the bills.</p>

<p>The majority of my work as a developer is web based, so when considering accessibility I tend to think about making things accessible for those with visual impairments; the blind and the partially sighted. Ensuring that the site works with screen readers and making sure controls and text have sufficient size and contrast is where a lot of accessibility effort is generally focused. There’s also things like not making tap targets not too close together, which is as much a mobile friendliness consideration as an accessibility consideration.</p>

<p>As most of my work is for the web, I don’t develop very many piece of software that utilise keyboard shortcuts extensively. If any of my future work does incorporate keyboard shortcuts, I’m certainly going to be considering how people with physical restrictions will be able to use them.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the “official” guidelines for keyboard shortcut accessibility are (or whether there are any guidelines!), but during the last few weeks of convalescence I’ve thought about the guidelines that I’d appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-guidelines-for-keyboard-shortcuts">Accessibility guidelines for keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single handed shortcuts:</strong> Prefer shortcut keys that can be reached with a single hand. Most shortcuts are comprised of a modifier key (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Win, Cmd) along with another “normal” key. Try to keep the “normal” key within reasonable reach of the modifier. Shift and Ctrl <em>usually</em> have keys on both sides of the keyboard, so more keys can be paired with these. Note that although Alt appears on both sides of the space bar, the right hand key is AltGr. They are actually two different keys, so keep that in mind when mapping shortcuts.</li>
  <li><strong>Remappable:</strong> It’s not always reasonable to make all the default keyboard shortcuts single-handed. It’s also likely that for able bodied users, some single handed shortcuts may actually be less comfortable or convenient than shortcuts that require both hands. That’s fine, and it’s a good idea to cater to your primary demographic. It’s also a good idea to allow users to remap these shortcuts. It’s not simply an accessibility feature, it’s great for the types that love to customise everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Provide alternatives:</strong> Providing an interface to allow users to remap their keyboard shortcuts isn’t always feasible. Maybe there’s no budget, or the scope of the project simply doesn’t allow for it. In these cases it’s simple and quick to provide alternatives to more complex or finger-stretching shortcuts. It doesn’t have to be every shortcut, but for commonly used shortcuts that are more comfortable with two hands, consider adding single-handed alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Nothing fancy or too technical. If in doubt about whether a keyboard shortcut complies with these guidelines, just try it with one hand! Imagine having to do that every time you require that shortcut… you’ll soon figure out whether it’s accessible or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">

<p>Floating-point formats are not the most glamorous or (frankly) the important
consideration when working with deep learning models: if your model isn’t working well,
then your floating-point format certainly isn’t going to save you! However, past a
certain point of model complexity/model size/training time, your choice of
floating-point format can have a significant impact on your model training times and
even performance.</p>
<p>Here’s how the rest of this post is structured:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Why should you, a deep learning practitioner,
care</a> about what floating-point format your
model uses?</li>
<li><a href="#floating-point-formats">What even <em>is</em> floating-point</a>, especially these new
floating-point formats made specifically for deep learning?</li>
<li><a href="#advice-for-practitioners">What practical advice is there</a> on using floating-point
formats for deep learning?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="floating-point-in-my-deep-learning">Floating-Point? In <em>My</em> Deep Learning?</h2>
<p><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/6052-its-more-likely-than-you-think">It’s more likely than you
think!</a></p>
<p>It’s been known for quite some time that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">deep neural networks can
tolerate</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551">lower numerical
precision</a>. High-precision calculations turn out not
to be that useful in training or inferencing neural networks: the additional precision
confers no benefit while being slower and less memory-efficient.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, some models can even reach a higher accuracy with lower precision, which
recent research attributes to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00095">regularization effects from the lower
precision</a>.</p>
<p>Finally (and this is speculation on my part — I haven’t seen any experiments or papers
corroborating this), it’s possible that certain complicated models <em>cannot converge</em>
unless you use an appropriately precise format. There’s a drift between the analytical
gradient update and what the actual backward propagation looks like: the lower the
precision, the bigger the drift. I’d expect that deep learning is particularly
susceptible to an issue here because there’s a lot of multiplications, divisions and
reduction operations.</p>
<h2 id="floating-point-formats">Floating-Point Formats</h2>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at three floating-point formats for deep learning. There are a
lot more floating-point formats, but only a few have gained traction: floating-point
formats require the appropriate hardware and firmware support, which restricts the
introduction and adoption of new formats.</p>
<p>For a quick overview, Grigory Sapunov wrote a great <a href="https://medium.com/@moocaholic/fp64-fp32-fp16-bfloat16-tf32-and-other-members-of-the-zoo-a1ca7897d407">run-down of various floating-point
formats for deep
learning</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ieee-floating-point-formats">IEEE floating-point formats</h3>
<p>These floating-point formats are probably what most people think of when someone says
“floating-point”. The IEEE standard 754 sets out several formats, but for the purposes
of deep learning we are only interested three:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format">FP32</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">FP64</a> (a.k.a.
half-, single- and double-precision floating-point formats)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Let’s take FP32 as an example. Each FP32 number is a sequence of 32 bits,
. Altogether, this sequence represents the real number</p>

<p>Here,  (the <em>sign bit</em>) determines the sign of the represented value.</p>
<p> through  determine the magnitude or scale of the represented value
(notice that a change in any of these bits drastically changes the size of the
represented value). These bits are called the <em>exponent</em> or <em>scale bits</em>.</p>
<p>Finally,  through  determine the precise value of the represented
value. These bits are called the <em>mantissa</em> or <em>precision bits</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the more bits you have, the more you can do. Here’s how the three formats
break down:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>Sign Bits</th>
<th>Exponent (Scale) Bits</th>
<th>Mantissa (Precision) Bits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FP16</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP32</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FP64</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are some details that I’m leaving out here (e.g. how to represent NaNs, positive
and negative infinities), but this is largely how floating point numbers work. A lot
more detail can be found on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers">Wikipedia
page</a>
and of course the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8766229">latest revision of the IEEE standard
754</a> itself.</p>
<p>FP32 and FP64 are widely supported by both software (C/C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and
hardware (x86 CPUs and most NVIDIA/AMD GPUs).</p>
<p>FP16, on the other hand, is not as widely supported in software (you need to use <a href="http://half.sourceforge.net/">a
special library</a> to use them in C/C++). However, since
deep learning is trending towards favoring FP16 over FP32, it has found support in the
main deep learning frameworks (e.g. <code>tf.float16</code> and <code>torch.float16</code>). In terms of
hardware, FP16 is not supported in x86 CPUs as a distinct type, but is well-supported on
modern GPUs.</p>
<h3 id="google-bfloat16">Google BFloat16</h3>
<p>BFloat16 (a.k.a. the Brain Floating-Point Format, after Google Brain) is basically the
same as FP16, but 3 mantissa bits become exponent bits (i.e. bfloat16 trades 3 bits’
worth of precision for scale).</p>

</figure>
<p>When it comes to deep learning, there are generally three “flavors” of values: weights,
activations and gradients. Google suggests storing weights and gradients in FP32, and
storing activations in bfloat16. However, in particularly gracious circumstances,
weights can be stored in bfloat16 without a significant performance degradation.</p>
<p>You can read a lot more on the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/bfloat16-the-secret-to-high-performance-on-cloud-tpus">Google Cloud
blog</a>,
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12322">this paper by Intel and Facebook studying the bfloat16
format</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of software support, bfloat16 is not supported in C/C++, but is supported in
TensorFlow (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>tf.bfloat16</code></a>) and
PyTorch (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf#bfloat16"><code>torch.bfloat16</code></a>).</p>
<p>In terms of hardware support, it is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Lake_(microarchitecture)">some modern
CPUS</a>, but the real
support comes out in GPUs and ASICs. At the time of writing, bfloat16 is supported by
the NVIDIA A100 (the first GPU to support it!), and <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/260344/future-amd-gpu-architecture-to-implement-bfloat16-hardware">will be supported in future AMD
GPUs</a>.
And of course, it is supported by Google TPU v2/v3.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia-tensorfloat">NVIDIA TensorFloat</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, this isn’t really its own floating-point format, just an overzealous
branding of the technique that NVIDIA developed to train in mixed precision on their
Tensor Core hardware<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>An NVIDIA TensorFloat (a.k.a. TF32) is just a 32-bit float that drops 13 precision bits
in order to execute on Tensor Cores. Thus, it has the precision of FP16 (10 bits), with
the range of FP32 (8 bits). However, if you’re not using Tensor Cores, it’s just a
32-bit float; if you’re only thinking about storage, it’s just a 32-bit float.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>One distinct advantage of TF32 is that they’re kind of like FP32. To quote from the
NVIDIA developer blog,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applications using NVIDIA libraries enable users to harness the benefits of TF32 with no
code change required. TF32 Tensor Cores operate on FP32 inputs and produce results in
FP32. Non-matrix operations continue to use FP32.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read more about TF32 <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/">on the NVIDIA
blog</a>, and
about its hardware support in the Ampere architecture on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ampere-architecture-in-depth/">the NVIDIA developer
blog</a>.</p>
<p>TF32 is not in the C/C++ standard at all, but is supported in <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-11-features-revealed/">CUDA
11</a>.</p>
<p>Hardware-wise, the NVIDIA A100 is the first GPU (and, at the time of writing, the only
device) supporting TF32.</p>
<h2 id="advice-for-practitioners">Advice for Practitioners</h2>
<p>The first thing to say is that floating-point formats are <em>by no means</em> the most
important consideration for your deep learning model — not even close. Floating-point
formats will most likely only make a difference for very large or complex models, for
which fitting the model on GPU memory is a challenge, or for which training times are
excruciatingly long.</p>
<p>The second thing to say is that any practical advice has to be heavily dependent on what
hardware you have available to you.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-mixed-precision-amp-training--a-good-default">Automatic mixed precision (AMP) training — a good default</h3>
<p>Most deep learning stacks support mixed-precision training, which is a pretty good
default option to reap some of the benefits of low-precision training, while still
reasonably avoiding underflow and overflow problems.</p>
<p>TensorFlow supports <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision">mixed-precision training
natively</a>, whereas the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex">NVIDIA Apex
library</a> makes automatic mixed precision training
available in PyTorch. To get started, take a look at NVIDIA’s <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">developer guide for
AMP</a>, and <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html">documentation for
training in mixed
precision</a>.</p>
<p>It’s worth going over the gist of mixed precision training. There are basically two main
tricks:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Loss scaling:</em> multiply the loss by some large number, and divide the gradient
updates by this same large number. This avoids the loss underflowing (i.e. clamping
to zero because of the finite precision) in FP16, while still maintaining faithful
backward propagation.</li>
<li><em>FP32 master copy of weights</em>: store the weights themselves in FP32, but cast them to
FP16 before doing the forward and backward propagation (to reap the performance
benefits). During the weight update, the FP16 gradients are cast to FP32 to update
the master copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can read more about these techniques in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740">this paper by NVIDIA and Baidu
Research</a>, or on the accompanying <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/">blog post by
NVIDIA</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-floating-point-formats--make-sure-itll-be-worth-it">Alternative floating-point formats — make sure it’ll be worth it</h3>
<p>If you’ve already trained your model in mixed precision, it might not be worth the time
or effort to port your code to take advantage of an alternative floating-point format
and bleeding edge hardware.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to go that route, make sure your use case really demands it.
Perhaps you can’t scale up your model without using bfloat16, or you really need to cut
down on training times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a well-informed opinion on how bfloat16 stacks up against
TF32, so “do your homework” is all I can advise. However, since the NVIDIA A100s only
just (at the time of writing) dropped into the market, it’ll be interesting to see what
the machine learning community thinks of the various low precision options available.</p>

                  I set up a procedural content creation pipeline that imports <a href="http://stinaflodstrom.com/projects/osm/www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data into Unity and uses the Houdini Engine to create realistic cityscapes based on real world locations. The goal was to have an as automated process as possible for generating environments based on real cities. The buildings and the roads are generated from OSM building shapes and road splines using a procedural system for building type and prop placing. Traffic lights, Crossings and Trees also get their positions from OSM. Values and procedural parameters can be tweaked in Unity making it possible to create endless variations.

                  </p><p>The project was developed with the simulation team in one of the bigger automotive companies as a proof of concept for creating syntetic data for AI and render out annotated images. The environmant is complete with tags for segmentation.

Question: Tell me more about Bastille Networks</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley: <a href="https://www.bastille.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille</span></a><span> is the leader in enterprise threat detection through software-defined radio. Bastille provides full visibility into the known and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/risks-of-cryptojacking-in-mobile-devices/">unknown mobile</a>, wireless, and <a href="https://secureblitz.com/secure-your-iot-devices/">Internet of Things devices</a> inside an enterprise’s corporate airspace–together known as the Internet of Radios. Through its patented software-defined radio and machine learning technology, Bastille senses, identifies, and localizes threats, providing security teams the ability to accurately quantify risk and mitigate airborne threats that could pose a danger to network infrastructure.</span></b></p><h3><b>2. Question: What’s unique and different about Bastille than other solutions/companies?</b></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley</strong>: Until Bastille, there was no way to apply network security mechanisms and countermeasures to RF-enabled IoT devices. IT security professionals couldn’t buy a security service like </span><a href="https://www.bastille.net/product/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Bastille Enterprise</span></a><span> until we invented it.</span></p><h3><strong>3. Question: Can you dive into radio frequency security and why it’s essential for enterprises?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> Corporate airspaces are under attack from invisible threats operating on Radio Frequencies (RF). Enterprises are often crucially reliant on wireless protocols, some that they don’t even know they’re using (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.). </span></p><p><span>These protocols are used in building controls and building access, for employee communications, IT, for employees. The exploitation of vulnerable wireless devices is growing increasingly common. Sophisticated attacks use compromised RF devices as their entry points into government and corporate networks. Foreign governments, competitors, and cybercriminals are conducting radio-based attacks on enterprises to access intellectual property and sensitive information.</span></p><h3><strong>4. Question: Can you discuss the importance of why enterprises need to implement and enforce more nuanced electronic device policies to accurately distinguish between approved and unapproved electronic devices in secure areas?</strong></h3><p><span><strong>Bob Baxley:</strong> RF-enabled devices are everywhere: According to Statistica, there are 4.7 billion Cellular phones, 8.4 billion Bluetooth devices, and 9 billion Wi-Fi devices, added to this is the increasing use of “wearables” such as FitBits and other personal devices with embedded radios, with a variety of audio/video capture, pairing and transmission capabilities.</span></p><p><span>Current policies are outdated: While some government and commercial buildings have secure areas where no cell phones or other RF-emitting devices are allowed, detecting and locating radio-enabled devices is largely based on the honor system or one time scans for devices. Bad actors do not follow the honor system and one time scans are, just that, one time and cannot monitor 24×7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>New solutions for a new age:</span><span> Bastille</span><span> enables security teams to differentiate between </span><b>approved and unapproved devices, and </b><span>accurately places </span><b>dots on a floor-plan map </b><span>for device location and sends alerts when a device is found where it should not be or doing what it should not do.</span> <span>Bastille</span><span> Networks also integrates with existing security systems such as Splunk, MDM, and camera systems.</span></p><h3><b>5. Question: What cybersecurity measures would you recommend for enterprises and why?</b></h3><p><b>Bob Baxley:&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Take Control of Your Airspace:<span> Obtain visibility into devices that use the big four protocols: cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and BLE. Locating every radio emitter provides situational awareness into devices in an enterprise’s network.</span></b></p><ul><li><b>Evaluate RF Technology:<span> Assessing RF security solutions is vital in preserving company secrets.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span> didnâ€™t really understand the word â€˜graceâ€™ until I swam with manta rays. These placid members of the shark family are the embodiment of grace; winged fish <a href="https://www.mantatrust.org/mobula-alfredi" target="_blank">14 feet</a> across who swoop and somersault with such precision that a manta scooping up plankton at speeds of up to <a href="https://www.deepseanews.com/2013/08/the-superhero-like-swimming-of-manta-rays/" target="_blank">22 miles per hour</a> can graze the hair of a SCUBA diver without touching her head. And as I experienced while diving in Hawaii, if you sit quietly on the ocean floor, theyâ€™ll do it not just once but again and again before disappearing into the blue abyss, as ephemeral as a cloud.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>For both their grace and their sheer otherworldly coolness, people love manta rays. The animals generate $50 million a year from tourists like me who want to swim or dive with them. But given how popular they are, much about mantas remains a mystery. They're truly wild creatures, too big for most aquariums and too far-ranging to easily study. Their life history and migration patterns are little known.&nbsp;No one has ever seen a manta give birth in the wild; we have no idea where they do so.&nbsp;And&nbsp;until&nbsp;recently, scientists thought there was only one kind of&nbsp;manta. It wasnâ€™t until 2009 that&nbsp;the more transient oceanic mantas (<em>Mobula birostris</em>) were recognized as a distinct species from the slightly smaller reef mantas (<em>Mobula alfredi</em>).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>â€œThere are these big, intelligent creatures roaming around and we just donâ€™t know much about them,â€� says&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Andrzejaczek, a shark scientist with the&nbsp;Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies have shown that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237067445_Trends_in_sightings_and_environmental_influences_on_a_coastal_aggregation_of_manta_rays_and_whale_sharks" target="_blank">overfishing</a> has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770565/" target="_blank">reduced</a> some manta populations by <a href="https://saveourseas.com/project-leader/lauren-peel/" target="_blank">80 percent</a>, and the IUCN Red List classifies both species as <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/195459/68632178" target="_blank">Vulnerable</a> and declining. Scientists are now trying to gather the basic information that could help the animals survive. In the process,&nbsp;they're learning that&nbsp;manta rays&nbsp;are more complex and fascinating than anyone imagined—bestowing their grace not just on humans lucky enough to swim with them, but on entire ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote>The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace.</blockquote>
<p>One way mantas shape marine environments is by traveling regularly between the deep ocean and coral reefs. Lauren Peel, a biologist with the Manta Trust and Save Our Seas Foundation, explains that in doing so, mantas move nutrients through the ocean. They eat a certain type of zooplankton that only lives offshore, for example, then return to coral reefs and defecate, depositing a suite of nutrients not otherwise available in the shallow seas.&nbsp;â€œTheyâ€™re essentially fertilizing coral reefs,â€� says Peel, who published a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.190599" target="_blank">2019 study</a> on the discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peel and her colleagues believe this fertilization may <a href="https://saveourseas.com/reef-manta-rays-may-promote-the-growth-of-coral-reefs-in-seychelles/" target="_blank">boost reef growth</a>, which not only leads to a greater biodiversity of corals and sponges but also supports the invertebrates, fish, mammals and reptiles that call reefs home. By analyzing tissue samples from 50 reef mantas and 20 different types of fish in the Seychelles, Peel also found that mantas are the only animals performing this essential fertilization. â€œOn top of being able to move such large distances and access different zooplankton sources, theyâ€™re consistently feeding, so theyâ€™re able to supply a larger amount of nutrients over a larger period of time over a larger spatial scale," Peel says.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Still, the realization that protecting mantas benefits entire coral communities isnâ€™t enough to save the species. Unlike some other imperiled fish, mantas are not targeted by an organized fishery that will grudgingly adhere to conservation measures like bag limits. Instead, mantas are killed by small local fisheries, poachers who sell their gills for traditional Chinese medicine, and commercial fishermen who accidentally take mantas as bycatch. That means the best way to protect them might be through refuges where no fishing is allowed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, keeping poachers out of vast, open marine protected areas (MPAs) is its own challenge. Thatâ€™s one reason why Andrzejaczek analyzed the movement of reef mantas in the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. By showing where mantas hang out, <a href="https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v639/p137-153/" target="_blank">her data</a> are helping patrol boats better target their policing.</p>
<p>To create adequate marine refuges, scientists must also to figure out how far mantas roam. A <a href="https://mbr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41200-019-0173-6" target="_blank">2019 study</a> showed that one reef manta swam a whopping 714 miles—hundreds of miles farther than the previous known record. Andrzejaczek, on the other hand, found that all 33 tagged mantas in her study stayed within the <a href="http://www.mpatlas.org/mpa/sites/7707499/%252523:~:text=On%252525201st%25252520April%252525202010,%25252520the,unrivalled%25252520in%25252520scale%25252520and%25252520significance." target="_blank">200-mile span</a> of the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA. Perhaps, she theorizes, some reef mantas migrate long distances while others stay local to a particular reef.</p>
<p>Manta raysâ€™ charisma could play a role in saving them, too. After a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0065051" target="_blank">2013 study</a> showed that a live manta can bring $1 million in tourism revenue in over its lifetime, compared to $500 dead, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/02/21/indonesia-hopes-cash-manta-ray-tourism.html" target="_blank">Indonesia joined</a> Australia, Ecuador, the European Union, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Yap, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Hawaii and Florida in banning manta ray fishing. The Manta Trust is also creating guidelines for sustainable manta ray tourism,&nbsp;like instructing divers to stay calm and let mantas guide the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>â€œItâ€™s understandable that people get excited,â€� says Annie Murray, a marine biologist with the Manta Trust. â€œBut unfortunately that can lead to people swimming really fast, chasing the manta to try to get the best selfie, and thatâ€™s going to disturb them, especially when theyâ€™re feeding.â€�&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_aa7e40c628a36f3002fd99c31b2755ad.jpg" alt="Manta from below"><figcaption><span><strong>Manta from below </strong>No two mantas have the same pattern of underbelly spots, making these invaluable for identifying individuals. </span><br><span>Guy Stevens | Manta Trust</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Murray herself has swam with dozens of mantas, each with distinct personalities. Without prompting, she, Peel and Andrzejaczek each described the animalsâ€™ curiosity and intellect with an awe thatâ€™s rare among scientists.&nbsp;â€œWhen you swim with mantas, itâ€™s an interaction between the two of you,â€� says Murray. â€œThatâ€™s what got me in the beginning. But from a more scientific point of view, Iâ€™m fascinated not only by how they interact with humans, but with each other.â€�<br></p>
<p>Manta rays have the largest brain-to-body ratios of any fish; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z" target="_blank">evidence suggests</a> they might also recognize themselves in mirrors, widely considered a hallmark of human-like self-awareness. She and others are studying how manta raysâ€™ clear intelligence manifests through social behaviors, and whether animals long considered solitary oceanic wanderers actually operate within social networks or hierarchies. While the social research is too new to draw conclusions from, itâ€™s within the realm of possibility that mantas form lifelong social bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more we learn about mantas, the more it calls to mind another definition of grace—â€œthe&nbsp;free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings.â€� The mere fact that we share a planet with manta rays is its own grace, a salve that can make even the most cynical scientist weep into her dive mask over the wonder that remains in this wild world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1&nbsp;The mantas I swam with in&nbsp;Hawaii were reef mantas, which have a wingspan of up to 14 feet. Oceanic, or giant, mantas can be nearly 23 feet across.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the last few years I’ve been developing predominantly on Apple
MacBooks. Recently I built myself a
<a href="https://tweakers.net/pricewatch/bestelkosten/2370528">new</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922">PC</a> with a fast
processor and lots of memory. I wanted to move some of my development tasks to
that machine. I still like the freedom that laptops give me to work from
wherever I want. Be it from the couch in my own home or from a random coffee
place in the city where I live, I just like to change environment every few
hours and not sit behind my desk all day long. I hadn’t used Windows as my
primary OS for almost 10 years. But since Windows 10 (still) comes with RDP,
which is better than VNC in terms of performance, and with WSL2, which offers a
“real” and well integrated linux experience, I was curious if I could create a
setup for remotely working on the new machine. It also would give me an
environment to debug Windows specific problems on, which should come in handy
for my side projects like <a href="https://github.com/borkdude/babashka">babashka</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/">clj-kondo</a>. If it didn’t work out, I
could always go dual boot with Ubuntu as the primary dev OS and use VNC if I
needed to do anything graphical. For what it is worth, here is a report of
setup process I went through.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pristine smell and beauty of a new PC contrasted with the chaotic reality of my home. <a href="https://t.co/3zLIzYg4XB">pic.twitter.com/3zLIzYg4XB</a></p>— (λ. borkdude) (@borkdude) <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280852700612177922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote>




<p>Because I had no other Windows machines in my home, I tried creating a USB
Windows installation drive in macOS based on
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-make-a-windows-10-usb-using-your-mac-build-a-bootable-iso-from-your-macs-terminal/">this</a>

Windows <a href="https://twitter.com/borkdude/status/1280943718363734016">would complain</a> with</p>

<blockquote><p>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error. Verify that the

<p>A good friend offered help and created an installation drive using
<a href="https://rufus.ie/">Rufus</a> on his Windows Home installation, which did work.</p>

<p>Once Windows was installed, I <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-allow-access">enabled RDP</a> and installed
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">WSL2</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9n6svws3rx71">Ubuntu 20.04</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Windows Terminal</a>
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/">Docker Desktop for WSL2</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to run WSL2, I had to enable a virtualization option in my BIOS
first.</p>

<p>I intend to use Ubuntu WSL2 as my primary dev environment on this machine, so it
made sense to tweak the <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1456511/is-there-a-way-to-change-the-default-shell-in-windows-terminal">Terminal configuration</a>
to open Ubuntu by default, instead of PowerShell. I found it annoying that
Ubuntu in Terminal starts in the Windows home directory (<code>/mnt/c/Users/borkdude</code>), so I set <code>"startingDirectory":
"//wsl$/Ubuntu-20.04/home/borkdude"</code> in my Ubuntu profile.</p>

<p>I use zsh as my default shell on macOS and wanted that in WSL2 as well so I
installed that using <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install zsh</code> followed by <code>chsh -s $(which
zsh)</code>. I also installed <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a> and enabled the
only two plugins I use on a daily basis: <code>git</code> and <code>jump</code>.</p>

<p>Then I started porting the dev setup I use for work on my MacBook, mainly
consisting of Docker images, a couple of Clojure projects, knitted together with
some bash scripts. I use a couple of shell scripts to set all my development
environment variables and aliases for easily setting up ssh tunnels. These
worked after only making a few tweaks (for example, the ethernet card is called
differently in macOS and Ubuntu in WSL2). Of course I needed to install <code>git</code> to
clone my work projects. To run Clojure projects I installed OpenJDK version 8
and 11 via <code>apt</code>. I use <a href="https://blog.michielborkent.nl/2020/07/26/remote-wsl2-clojure/jenv.be">jenv</a> to manage Java versions on a project
basis, which worked perfectly:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span>
<span>2</span>
</pre></td><td><pre><code><span>sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
</span><span>jenv add /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>Also I installed <a href="https://boot-clj.com/">boot</a>, a Clojure build tool and the
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">Clojure CLI</a> which are all well
supported in linux.</p>

<p>Before running my work projects, I wanted to copy over a PostgreSQL database and
other data from my MacBook using <code>rsync</code>. Before I could do that, I needed to
enable <code>ssh</code> in Ubuntu. I found out I could do this by running <code>sudo service ssh
start</code> but I still could not log in from my MacBook. It turns out you also have
to forward and open up the port in the Windows Firewall. I found
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723">this</a>
PowerShell script that lets you do that. As the comment suggests, I also created
a scheduled task that runs this script upon Windows login. I did the same thing
for running the <code>ssh</code> service using <code>wsl -u root sudo service ssh start</code>. Be
sure to select <code>Run using the highest privileges</code>. I’m sure there is a better
way to do this via <code>systemd</code> in WSL2, but this works for me. So now I could
<code>rsync</code> my the data from macOS to WSL2. I started the Docker containers, the
Clojure projects and it worked! We have a fairly I/O intensive process as part
of our stack, which seems to perform well in WSL2.</p>

<p>Enabling SSH in WSL also lets me use Emacs from my laptop and edit files on the
remote machine using <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode">tramp mode</a>. I
ran into one issue with this. Since I use a non-standard prompt in zsh, emacs
tramp could not parse the output from the remote shell. So I added this hack to
my <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>

<p>Emacs sets <code>TERM</code> to <code>"dumb"</code> when opening files using <code>tramp</code>. When this is the
case, I just invoke <code>bash</code> instead of continuing with <code>zsh</code>. There may be a
better solution, but this works.</p>

<p>Of course I also wanted to be able to run Emacs on the machine itself. I first
tried to run Emacs in Windows <a href="https://github.com/m-parashar/emax64">natively</a>,
but I read somewhere that editing WSL2 files directly from Windows is not
recommended. Also you might run into the line ending differences between Windows
and linux/macOS. I decided to play it safe and install emacs inside WSL2 using
<code>apt</code>. If you do decide to use the Windows-native Emacs and have trouble finding
where emacs expects configuration files, you can find this using <code>M-x
describe-variable user-init-file</code>. On my machine that was
<code>C:\Users\borkdude\AppData\Roaming\.config\emacs\init.el.</code>. To get a graphical
UI for the emacs started from WSL2, I needed to install an X-server on
Windows. There are plenty of free and open source solutions to choose from, but
I chose to buy
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/x410/9nlp712zmn9q?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">X410</a>
on sale for $9.99 instead of $49.99. It seems to be actively worked on and has
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/wsl/using-x410-with-wsl2/">good documentation</a>. To
automatically start X410 on Windows startup I followed
<a href="https://x410.dev/cookbook/automatically-start-x410-on-login/">these</a>
instructions. When started, in the tray there is an X icon where you can modify
settings for X410. I have enabled Windowed Apps, Allow Public Access, DPI
Scaling (High Quality) and Shared Clipboard. To export the right <code>DISPLAY</code> value
for GUI applications in WSL2 I have this in my <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>

</pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>export </span><span>DISPLAY</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cat /etc/resolv.conf <span>|</span> grep nameserver <span>|</span> awk <span>'{print $2; exit;}'</span><span>)</span>:0.0
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>and then run emacs using <code>setsid emacs</code> from a zsh session (I created an alias
for this in my <code>.zshenv</code>).</p>

<p>I’m using the exact same emacs config I use on macOS, which is based on
<a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov">@bbatsov</a>’s
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">prelude</a>. It looks and feels the same as on
macOS, although now I probably have to learn the “real” emacs keybindings for
copying (<code>M-w</code>) and pasting (<code>C-y</code>) instead of using the macOS keybindings,
which may be in fact a nice side effect of this experiment.</p>

<p>Even connecting to an nREPL server with <code>cider-connect</code> works seemlessly from my
laptop, provided that I forward and open up the port in Windows Firewall like
described above.</p>

<p>Some closing tips.</p>

<p>There is a known <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">issue</a> with
memory usage of WSL2. Since linux uses non-allocated memory for filesystem
caching, Windows thinks this memory is really used. As time goes by, Windows
could end up allocating all your system’s memory to WSL2. To put a limit to
this, I use this config in <code>C:\Users\borkdude\.wslconfig</code>:</p>

</span><span><span>memory</span><span>=</span>92GB
</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure>


<p>My PC has a whopping 128GB of memory so this still leaves 36GB of memory to
Windows.</p>

<p>As I will mainly use this PC for work, I turn it off at night and during the
weekends. To get back where I left, without restarting all my development
processes from scratch, I use the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/920730/how-to-disable-and-re-enable-hibernation-on-a-computer-that-is-running">Hibernate</a>
setting.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to set up a VPN between my laptop and
Windows machine so I can connect through RDP, emacs tramp and/or nREPL when I go
outside of my home.</p>

<p>For RDP I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop.app</a>. Since I have a Retina screen, I enabled the “optimize for Retina displays” setting which gives a better resolution.</p>

<p>As a bonus I can re-use some licenses I already owned for apps I am using on
macOS: Beyond Compare and Acronis True Image.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised with WSL2, the Terminal app and Docker
integration. I’ve only been using this setup for week but so far so good.</p>

July 27, 2020 | https://vriad.com/essays/a-proposal-for-open-source-sustainability | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vriad.com/essays/a-proposal-for-open-source-sustainability">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23985265">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>Currently, most open-source funding takes the form of a one-off or monthly donation to a specific project. GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective, Tidelift, and Patreon will never be able to facilitate truly sustainable open source funding. Why?</p><p>Because open-source projects are not created equal.</p><p>Most of the big "success stories" of open-source funding are what I'll call <strong>structural tools</strong>: big pieces of software that do a lot. Think operating systems (Red Hat, Elementary OS), frameworks (Livewire, Next.js), CMSs (Ghost, Wordpress), or fully self-hostable applications (Sentry, Blender, Discourse). </p><p>These projects are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.</p><p>But most open source projects aren't like that. Most are better described as <strong>utilities</strong> —&nbsp;an apt term for the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in today's world. These are the small tools that do one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utility libraries — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>But these utility libraries rarely get any funding, no matter how useful or popular they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based SPAs, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. The fact that creating a tool as ubiquitous and successful as react-router still wouldn't pay the rent is...deflating.</p><p>Why is there such a gap between the value created by open source software and the funding it receives? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark></p><p>Instead we must suffer the pain of creating <em>yet another</em> auto-renewing monthly subscription for <em>each and every</em> project we want to support. And at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor react-router!"</em>) it's all too easy to "logic" ourselves out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a massive dampening effect on the total amount of money donated to OSS.</p><p>In the end, only the projects that are massively, indisputably valuable to us get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, structural tooling, and full-featured software. And the small stuff is left in the cold.</p><p>But I don't write essays just to spout pessimism into the world! So below I propose a novel-ish approach to OSS sustainability.</p><p>So here's what I propose.</p><ol><li>Donors contribute money to their personal "<strong>sponsorship pool</strong>". The "pool" is the set of open-source projects they want to support.**</li><li>Contributions are distributed to the projects in their pool. Various mechanisms for this are discussed below.**</li><li>Adding new projects to the pool should require <strong>one click</strong>.</li></ol><p><strong>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.</strong> Once a person has funded their sponsorship pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark></p><h2>The GitHub implementation</h2><p>The best case scenario is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. GitHub is where the code lives (usually) so it is best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><h3>A stellar idea</h3><p>Here's an idea — what if you could make a donation that gets distributed evenly among all the repos you've starred on GitHub? After all, what are stars for if not to express appreciation? If I've funded my "sponsor pool", supporting a project should be as easy as clicking the "Star" button.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would undoubtedly divorce the allocation mechanism from Stars. They want to keep the concept of a "star" as ambiguous and unencumbered as possible. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsorship pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the standard "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><h3>Financial considerations</h3><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to a system like this — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Switching to larger, annual donations means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed, they'll still end up paying more in fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsorship pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><h3>Social proof</h3><p>Final thought —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable badges that are "unlocked" at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;I can imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>You may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Glimpsing a rainbow</h2><p>Theoretically you, dear reader, could take these ideas and implement them. I wouldn't advise it; there's not much money in open-source, and even less in open-source donation processing. As for me, I'm holding out for "GitHub Sponsor Pool" — hopefully Uber won't sue them over the name.</p><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to come off as critical of any funding platform mentioned; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. This is merely a hypothetical exercise...</p><p>...for now. If you want to get updates on this proposal —&nbsp;like if someone implements it! — you can join the mailing list I created for that purpose: <a href="https://buttondown.email/sponsorship_pools">buttondown.email/sponsorship_pools</a>. No spam, just news and updates relating to this proposal.</p><p><em>I'm Colin, I wrote this post, and I'm probably gonna write more. If you wanna hear when that happens, join <a href="https://vriad.com/newsletter">my mailing list</a> or follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">@vriad</a>. ✌️</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Flu (influenza) and pneumonia vaccinations are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, according to new research reported at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference® (AAIC®) 2020.</p>

<p>Three research studies reported at AAIC 2020 suggest:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least one flu vaccination was associated with a 17% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence. </li>
<li>More frequent flu vaccination was associated
with another 13% reduction in Alzheimer's incidence.</li>
<li>Vaccination against pneumonia between ages 65 and 75 reduced Alzheimer's risk by up to 40% depending on individual genes.</li>
<li>Individuals with dementia have a higher risk of dying (6-fold) after infections than those without dementia (3-fold).</li>
</ul>

<p>"With the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are at the forefront of public health discussions. It is important to explore their benefit in not only protecting against viral or bacterial infection but also improving long-term health outcomes," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer.</p>

<p>"It may turn out to be as simple as if you're taking care of your health in this way — getting vaccinated — you're also taking care of yourself in other ways, and these things add up to lower risk of Alzheimer's and other dementias," Carrillo said. "This research, while early, calls for further studies in large, diverse clinical trials to inform whether vaccinations as a public health strategy decrease our risk for developing dementia as we age."</p>

<h2>Seasonal Flu Vaccine May Reduce Incidence of Alzheimer's Dementia</h2>

<p>Previous research has suggested vaccinations may have a protective factor against cognitive decline, but there have been no large, comprehensive studies focused on the influenza (flu) vaccine and Alzheimer's disease risk, specifically. To address this gap, Albert Amran, a medical student at McGovern Medical School at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and team, investigated a large American health record dataset (n=9,066).</p>

<p>Amran and team found having one flu vaccination was associated with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.83, p&lt;0.0001), and among vaccinated patients receiving the flu vaccine more frequently was associated with an even lower prevalence of Alzheimer's (odds ratio 0.87, p=0.0342). Thus, people that consistently got their annual flu shot had a lower risk of Alzheimer's. This translated to an almost 6% reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease for patients between the ages of 75-84 for 16 years.</p>

<p>The researchers found the protective association between the flu vaccine and the risk of Alzheimer's was strongest for those who received their first vaccine at a younger age — for example, the people who received their first documented flu shot at age 60 benefited more than those who received their first flu shot at age 70.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that regular use of a very accessible and relatively cheap intervention — the flu shot — may significantly reduce risk of Alzheimer's dementia," Amran said. "More research is needed to explore the biological mechanism for this effect — why and how it works in the body — which is important as we explore effective preventive therapies for Alzheimer's."</p>

<h2>Pneumonia Vaccine May Reduce Alzheimer's Risk later in life.</h2><p>
 Repurposing of existing vaccines may be a promising approach to Alzheimer's disease prevention. Svetlana Ukraintseva, Ph.D., Associate Research Professor in the Biodemography of Aging Research Unit (BARU) at Duke University Social Science Research Institute, and team, investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination, with and without an accompanying seasonal flu shot, and the risk of Alzheimer's disease among 5,146 participants age 65+ from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The team also took into account a known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's — the rs2075650 G allele in the TOMM40 gene.</p>

<p>The researchers found that pneumococcal vaccination between ages 65-75 reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's by 25-30% after adjusting for sex, race, birth cohort, education, smoking, and number of G alleles. The largest reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's (up to 40%) was observed among people vaccinated against pneumonia who were non-carriers of the risk gene. Total number of vaccinations against pneumonia and the flu between ages 65 and 75 was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's; however, the effect was not evident for the flu shot alone.</p>

<p>"Vaccinations against pneumonia before age 75 may reduce Alzheimer's risk later in life, depending on individual genotype," Ukraintseva said. "These data suggest that pneumococcal vaccine may be a promising candidate for personalized Alzheimer's prevention, particularly in non-carriers of certain risk genes."</p>

<h2>Infection Substantially Increases Mortality in People with Dementia</h2>

<p>People living with dementia commonly experience other health conditions including viral, bacterial, and other infections. There is a growing trend in research to investigate whether infections might be worsening, more life-threatening or possibly causing dementia.</p>

<p>Janet Janbek, a Ph.D. student at the Danish Dementia Research Centre, Rigshospitalet and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and team, used data from national health registries to investigate mortality in Danish residents over age 65 (n=1,496,436) who had visited the hospital with an infection. They found that people with both dementia and such hospital visits died at a 6.5 times higher rate compared with people who had neither. Study participants with either dementia alone or infection-related contacts alone had a threefold increased rate. The rate of mortality was highest within the first 30 days following the hospital visit.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that for people living with dementia the mortality rates remained elevated for 10 years after the initial infection-related hospital visit, and mortality rates from all infections (including major infections like sepsis to minor ear infections) were higher compared with people without dementia or without an infection-related hospital visit.</p>

<p>"Our study supports the need to investigate these relations even further; to find out why infections are linked to higher mortality in people with dementia, specifically which risk factors and biological mechanisms are involved. This will help advance our understanding of the role of infections in dementia," said Janbek.</p>

<p>"Our study suggests that the health care system — as well as relatives of people with dementia — should have increased awareness of people with dementia who get infections, so they get the medical care they need. People with dementia require more specialized treatment even when their hospital visits are not directly due to their dementia but to what might appear to be an unrelated infection," Janbek added.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>You can try it out for yourself using this link <a href="https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com/">https://sudoku.cmgresearch.com</a> - just hold a Sudoku puzzle up to your WebCam. Or try it on your mobile phone - it should work pretty well in a mobile browser.</p>

<p>A long time ago I wrote an app for the iPhone that let you take a grab a sudoku puzzle using your iPhone’s camera.</p>

<p>Recently, when I was investigating my <a href="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/2020/06/05/self-organising-ws2811-leds.html">self organising Christmas lights project</a> I realised that the browser APIs and ecosystem had advanced to the point that it was probably possible to recreate the system running purely in the browser.</p>

<p>As you can see it works pretty well:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOC-ad0BsY0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As always, all the code is on GitHub for you to try out for yourself: <a href="https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku">https://github.com/atomic14/ar-browser-sudoku</a></p>

<p>It’s good to start with a simple definition of the problem we are trying to solve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given an image identify and extract the Sudoku puzzle, recognise the numbers in each cell, solve the puzzle, render the results on top of the original image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/1-puzzle.jpg" alt="Puzzle Image"></p>

<p>As a classically trained image processing guy, my first port of call is to remove redundant information.</p>

<p>We don’t care about colours, so we’ll convert the image to greyscale. As you can see we’ve not lost any useful information.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/2-greyscale.jpg" alt="Greyscale Image"></p>

<p>Looking at the image, we only ready care about paper and ink, so it makes sense to binarise the image and make black or white.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/3-thresholded.png" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Next, we need to identify the blob that is the puzzle. Once we’ve got that we can extract the image of the puzzle and extract the contents of each box of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/4-located.jpg" alt="Thresholded Image"></p>

<p>Apply some OCR to the contents of each box, solve the puzzle and our job is done.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/6-solved.png" alt="Solved Puzzle"></p>

<p>It’s a pretty straightforward image processing pipeline!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/7-pipeline.jpg" alt="Pipeline"></p>

<p>Let’s dive into each of these steps in turn and see how they work.</p>



<p>We’re taking a feed from the camera on the device. This comes into us as an RGB image. We’re not really interested in colour as we’re working with printed puzzles which will typically by printed in black and white.</p>

<p>So our first step is to convert from RGB to greyscale.</p>

<p>If we look at the standard formula for this we get this fomula <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What’s interesting about this is that a large portion of the value is coming from the green channel. So we can apply a little shortcut to our RGB to greyscale conversion and just take the green channel of the image.</p>



<p>We’re going to use morphological operations for locating the puzzle - typically these work on black and white binary images, so our next step is binarise our image.</p>

<p>This involves applying a threshold to seperate out foreground from background pixels.</p>

<p>Trying to apply a global threshold to the image can result in very poor results - especially when lighting conditions are not good.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/8-global-threshold.jpg" alt="Global Threshold"></p>

<p>However, if we look at a small section of the image we can see from the histogram that we do have an obvious collection of ink pixels and paper pixels.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/9-local-threshold-hist.jpg" alt="Local Area Histogram"></p>

<p>What we want to do is examine each pixel in the context of its surrounding area.</p>

<p>A simple way to do this is to apply a blur to the image and then compare the original image with this blurred image.</p>

<p>Doing this gives us a very clean segmented image even when lighting conditions are not ideal</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/A-local-thresholded.jpg" alt="Local Threshold"></p>



<p>We’ve now got a fairly clean image that contains our puzzle along with a bunch of random other printed elements. Typically you’d jump straight in here with something like a hough transform to detect lines. However we can be a bit smarter about what we are doing and take a bit of a shortcut.</p>

<p>We know that whoever is taking the picture should be pointing the camera at a puzzle. So we can assume that the puzzle would be the largest object in the image and also have the most number of pixels. We can also apply other heuristics such as aspect ratio to filter out elements that probably aren’t a puzlle.</p>

<p>If we scan the image pulling out all connected components the connected component that contains the puzzle should be the one with the most points.</p>

<p>Doing this lets us isolate the puzzle grid.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/B-located.png" alt="Located Puzzle"></p>



<p>With the puzzle grid identified we now need to identify the four corners of the puzzle. Once again we can apply a fairly simple heuristic to this problem. The pixels that are in the four corners should have the smallest manhatten distance from the corners of the max extents of the extracted component.</p>

<p>Runing this algorithm for all four extents of our located puzzle gives us the four corners.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/D-corners.png" alt="Puzzle Corners"></p>



<p>We know where the puzzle is in our image. We have the location of the four corner points.</p>

<p>To extract the puzzle image we formulate our problem into one of a homographic transform.</p>

<p>We want to map from the camera image of the puzzle to an ideal image of the puzzle that is not distorted by perpective or rotations.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography.png" alt="Mapping from flat image to camera image"></p>

<p>We do this by computing a homography between the two planes. The formula shown can be transformed into this - as you can see we need four points - this maps nicely onto the corner points that we’ve already located.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography2.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>If we rewrite the matrices algebraically we can find h using this algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/E-homography3.png" alt="Calculating the homography"></p>

<p>You can find more details on how to do this here - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/">https://web.archive.org/web/20150316191717/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cwren/interpolator/</a></p>

<p>Now that we have the homography between our ideal image and the camera image we can map pixels between images.</p>

<p>This gives us a nice square puzzle image from the camera image.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/F-extracted.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>Once we’ve got the square puzzle image we need to extract the contents of each individual cell. We can use the thresholded version of the image for this.</p>

<p>Looking at each box in turn we extract the bounds of any connected region starting from the center of each cell. We can then use this bounds to extract an image from the square greyscale image.</p>

<p>If there is no connected region in the center of the cell then we know that it is empty.</p>

<p>We now have an image for each populated cell of the puzzle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/G-boxes.jpg" alt="Extracted Puzzle"></p>



<p>We’re going to use a neural network to perform OCR on each image. I’m going to use TensorFlow to train the network and then TensorFlow js to run the network in the browser.</p>

<p>Our neural network is going to be trained to recognise the digits 1 through 9.</p>

<p>I’ve synthesized a large number of training examples from a wide selection of fonts rendering a greyscale image of each digit.</p>

<p>I’ve added a small amount of blur and some Gaussian noise to each image. Hopefully this will provide a reasonable representation of what we will be getting in a live environment.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training"></p>

<p>I’ve also sparated out 10% of the images into a testing data set that we can use to evaluate how well our network performs.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I’m using an interactive Jupyter notebook to train the network - this is available in the GitHub repository. You’ll also find more information on the training in the YouTube video.</p>

<p>I perform some image normalisation and resize the input images to 20 by 20 pixels - we need to remember to also do this in the javascript code so that it matches.</p>

<p>I’m also augmenting our training data to help the network generalise. This will add some random mutations to our input data set.</p>

<p>Running the training we can see that we have pretty good accuracy on both training and validation.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training.jpg" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the confusion matrix we can see that “1”s and “7”s are currently getting confused.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training3.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>Looking at the failed images I’m pretty happy with the performance. I think the fonts that it is failing on would not be used in the real world so I’m happy to ignore these failures.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training5.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>

<p>As I’m happy with the neural network structure I’m going to train it on all the data and use the resulting network in my production code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/H-training6.png" alt="Training Accuracy"></p>



<p>We can solve a sudoku puzzle using Donald Knuth’s application of Dancing Links to his Algorithm X for solving the exact cover problem.</p>

<p>Dancing links uses the seemingly very simple realisation that we can remove and put back nodes from a doubly linked list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX1.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>We can see that when we remove node B from the list it still has pointers back to the nodes that used to link to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX2.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>This means that node B contains all the information required to add it back into the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX3.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>I go into more detail in the video around Algorithm X and you can find a good description in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X">WikiPedia artical</a>.</p>

<p>Dancing links solves the problem of backtracking in an efficient way.</p>

<p>We can encode the sparse matrix used by Algorithm X as a doubly linked circular list going left and right for the rows and up and down for the columns.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX4.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>

<p>Since these are now linked lists we can use fact that we can efficiently remove and re-add elements to perform the column and row removals and to backtrack if needed.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of this algorithm by recoding our sudoku puzzle as an exact coverage problem. Translating a puzzle into a set of constraints gives us a sparse matrix of 729 rows by 324 columns.</p>

<p>Here’s what a sudoku puzzle looks like when turned into a set of constraints.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/I-DLX5.png" alt="Dancing Links"></p>



<p>To render our results we could draw our text into a square image and then project each pixel onto the image coming from the camera. This would be quite computationally intensive.</p>

<p>Alternatively for each puzzle cell we could take an imaginary line through the center of each cell. We can then project that using our homographic transform and use this project line to calculate an approximate height and angle for the cell.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering.png" alt="Approximate Digit Angle And Size"></p>

<p>We then simply draw the text at the projected location of the cell with the calculated height and angle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cmgresearch.com/assets/article_images/ar-sudoku/J-rendering2.jpg" alt="Rendered Solution"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>So <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> came out while I wasn't looking last week. The
GnuTLS advisory (<a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03</a>) is pretty opaque so I'll
refer instead to <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1270061316368224256">this tweet</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> (Go team
security lead):</p>

<blockquote><p>PSA: don't rely on GnuTLS, please.</p>

<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13777">CVE-2020-13777</a> Whoops, for the past 10 releases most TLS 1.0–1.2
connection could be passively decrypted and most TLS 1.3 connections
intercepted. Trivially.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/we-need-to-talk-about-session-tickets/">TLS 1.2–1.0 session tickets are awful</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are reading this correctly: supposedly encrypted TLS connections
made with affected GnuTLS releases are vulnerable to <em>passive</em>
cleartext recovery attack (and active for 1.3, but who uses that
anyways). That is extremely bad. It's pretty close to just switching
everyone to HTTP instead of HTTPS, more or less. I would have a lot
more to say about the security of GnuTLS in particular -- and security
in general -- but I am mostly concerned about patching holes in the
roof right now, so this article is not about that.</p>

<p>This article is about figuring out what, exactly, was exposed in our
infrastructure because of this.</p>






<p>Assuming you're running Debian, this will show a list of packages that
<code>Depends</code> on GnuTLS:</p>

<pre><code>apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes you run this only on hosts running Buster or
above. Otherwise you'll need to figure out a way to pick machines
running GnuTLS 3.6.4 or later.</p>

<p>Note that this list only <em>first level</em> dependencies! It is perfectly
possible that another package uses GnuTLS without being listed
here. For example, in the above list I have <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code>, so the
be really thorough, I would actually need to recurse down the
dependency tree.</p>

<p>On my desktop, this shows an "interesting" list of targets:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apt</code></li>
<li><code>cadaver</code> - AKA WebDAV</li>
<li><code>curl</code> &amp; <code>wget</code></li>
<li><code>fwupd</code> - another attack on top of <a href="https://github.com/justinsteven/advisories/blob/master/2020_fwupd_dangling_s3_bucket_and_CVE-2020-10759_signature_verification_bypass.md">this one</a></li>
<li><code>git</code> (through the <code>libcurl3-gnutls</code> dependency)</li>
<li><code>mutt</code> - all your emails</li>
<li><code>weechat</code> - your precious private chats</li>
</ul>


<p>Arguably, fetchers like <code>apt</code>, <code>curl</code>, <code>fwupd</code>, and <code>wget</code> rely on HTTPS for
"authentication" more than secrecy, although <code>apt</code> has its own
OpenPGP-based authentication so that wouldn't matter anyways. Still,
this is truly distressing. And I haven't mentioned here things like
<code>gobby</code>, <code>network-manager</code>, <code>systemd</code>, and others - the scope of this is
broad. Hell, even good old <code>lynx</code> links against GnuTLS.</p>

<p>In our infrastructure, the magic command looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cumin -o txt -p 0  'F:lsbdistcodename=buster' "apt-cache --installed rdepends libgnutls30 | grep '^ ' | sort -u" | tee gnutls-rdepds-per-host | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
</code></pre>

<p>There, the result is even more worrisome, as those important packages seem to rely on GnuTLS for their transport security:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mariadb</code> - all MySQL traffic and passwords</li>
<li><code>mandos</code> - full disk encryption</li>
<li><code>slapd</code> - LDAP passwords</li>
</ul>


<p><code>mandos</code> is especially distressing although it's probably not
vulnerable because it seems it doesn't store the cleartext -- it's
encrypted with the client's OpenPGP public key -- so the TLS tunnel
never sees the cleartext either.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jedisct1/status/1270078914996682753">Other reports</a> have also mentioned the following servers link
against GnuTLS and could be vulnerable:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>exim</code></li>
<li><code>rsyslog</code></li>
<li><code>samba</code></li>
<li>various <code>VNC</code> implementations</li>
</ul>




<p>Those programs are not affected by this vulnerability:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apache2</code></li>
<li><code>gnupg</code></li>
<li><code>python</code></li>
<li><code>nginx</code></li>
<li><code>openssh</code></li>
</ul>


<p>This list is not exhaustive, naturally, but serves as an example of
common software you don't need to worry about.</p>

<p>The vulnerability only exists in GnuTLS, as far as we know, so
programs linking against other libraries are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>Because the vulnerability affects session tickets -- and those are set
on the server side of the TLS connection -- only users of GnuTLS as a
server are vulnerable. This means, for example, that while <code>weechat</code>
uses GnuTLS, it will only suffer from the problem when acting as a
server (which it does, in relay mode) or, of course, if the remote IRC
server also uses GnuTLS. Same with apt, curl, wget, or git: it is
unlikely to be a problem because it is only used as a client; the
remote server is usually a webserver -- not git itself -- when using
TLS.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it's not because a package links against GnuTLS that
it <em>uses</em> it. For example, I have been told that, on Arch Linux, if
both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are available, the <code>mutt</code> package will use the
latter, so it's not affected. I haven't confirmed that myself nor have I
checked on Debian.</p>

<p>Also, because it relies on session tickets, there's a time window
after which the ticket gets cycled and properly initialized. But that
is <a href="https://twitter.com/__agwa/status/1270054740559384576">apparently 6 hours by default</a> so it is going to protect only
really long-lasting TLS sessions, which are uncommon, I would argue.</p>

<p>My audit is limited. For example, it might have been better to walk
the shared library dependencies directly, instead of relying on Debian
package dependencies.</p>



<p>It seems the vulnerability might have been introduced in <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/695">this merge
request</a>, itself following a (entirely reasonable) <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/184">feature request
to make it easier to rotate session tickets</a>. The merge request was
open for a few months and was thoroughly reviewed by a peer before
being merged. Interestingly, the vulnerable function
(<code>_gnutls_initialize_session_ticket_key_rotation</code>), explicitly says:</p>

<pre><code> * This function will not enable session ticket keys on the server side. That is done
 * with the gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server() function. This function just initializes
 * the internal state to support periodical rotation of the session ticket encryption key.
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it thinks it is not responsible for session ticket
initialization, yet it is. Indeed, the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275/">merge request fixing the
problem</a> unconditionally does this:</p>

<pre><code>memcpy(session-&gt;key.initial_stek, key-&gt;data, key-&gt;size);
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't reviewed the code and the vulnerability in detail, so take
the above with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/merge_requests/1275.patch">full patch is available here</a>. See also the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011">upstream issue
1011</a>, the <a href="https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2020-06-03">upstream advisory</a>, the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-13777">Debian security
tracker</a>,
and the <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1843723">Redhat Bugzilla</a>.</p>



<p>The impact of this vulnerability depends on the affected packages and
how they are used. It can range from "meh, someone knows I downloaded
that Debian package yesterday" to "holy crap my full disk encryption
passwords are compromised, I need to re-encrypt all my drives",
including "I need to change all LDAP and MySQL passwords".</p>

<p>It promises to be a fun week for some people at least.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, one has to wonder whether we should follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a>'s advice and stop using GnuTLS altogether. There are
at least a few programs that link against GnuTLS because of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Licensing">OpenSSL licensing oddities</a> but that has been first announced in
2015, then <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2017/03/22/license/">definitely and clearly resolved in 2017</a> -- or <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/2/top-foss-legal-developments">maybe
that was in 2018</a>? Anyways it's fixed, pinky-promise-I-swear,
except if you're one of those weirdos still using GPL-2, of
course. Even though OpenSSL isn't the simplest and secure TLS
implementation out there, it could preferable to GnuTLS and maybe we
should consider changing Debian packages to use it in the future.</p>

<p>But then again, the last time something like this happened, it was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> and GnuTLS wasn't affected, so who knows... It is
likely that people don't have OpenSSL in mind when they suggest moving
away from GnuTLS and instead think of other TLS libraries like
<a href="https://tls.mbed.org/">mbedtls</a> (previously known as PolarSSL), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Security_Services">NSS</a>, <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/">BoringSSL</a>,
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and so on. Not that those are totally sinless either...</p>

<p>"This is fine", as they say...</p>

        <p>2020-07-26</p>

        <p>We’ve been doing a lot of mob programming at work the last year or so and I’ve seen that I have a different attitude to naming things than others on my team. When I see that a name can be improved I always think this is priority number one. My colleagues often say “later”.</p>

<p>I also saw something related recently when doing a programming course internally at work. I sat and helped a guy with an issue he was having. I saw a really bad variable name and recommended he change it. He said “later, I just need to fix this first”. I pushed the point once more saying “trust me” and then left him to his devices. A few minutes later he asked for help again, being totally stuck. Renaming the variable got him immediately unstuck. He had wasted lots of time because the name put him in a mental trap.</p>

<p>My philosophy is: <em>there are only two acceptable types of names: good names and metasyntactic names</em>. If you have a name that is bad or just a bit misleading it’s better to rename it to <code>foo</code> NOW.</p>

<p>I believe good (or metasyntactic) names lead to easier problem solving and less effort in programming. It’s not just something we add at the end to make the code more understandable to others or future you. To me the primary thing we work with in programming isn’t numbers or computation, but language.</p>

  <p><span>This essay was co-authored by <a href="https://kortina.nyc/">Andrew Kortina</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@namratalpatel">Namrata Patel</a>.</span></p>

<p>Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment. In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.</p>

<p>At the macro level, this results in sub-optimal production, as firms are unable to satisfy their demand for labor via the usual mechanism of increasing wages. If you believe that economic productivity and growth are good, this presents a challenge when attempting to design stimulus policy, because subsidies or increases to the minimum wage would yield the same non-result as firms increasing wages. We discuss the potential efficacy of the somewhat radical idea of a tax on human attention or time spent consuming entertainment media as a way to stimulate productivity.</p>

<h3 id="declining-labor-participation-in-younger-demographics">Declining Labor Participation in Younger Demographics</h3>

<p>The overall labor force participation rate in the United States has been declining for the past several decades. The most obvious potential explanation would be an aging population (retirees comprising an increasing percentage of the overall population), but you can see this is not the root cause when you break out the labor force participation rate by age and sex:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.nyc/files/kinky-labor-supply/00-labor-participation.png"><figcaption>Labor Participation Rate via <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Labor participation has been dropping much faster for young men than any other groups. <em>(Interestingly, labor participation has been increasing most rapidly for older demographics, presumably because they must continue working later in life in order to support basic needs and healthcare costs).</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf">Leisure Luxuries and the Labor Supply of Young Men</a>, Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst note that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite stagnant wages, declining employment rates, and an increased propensity to live with their parents, younger men report increased happiness during the 2000s. This contrasts sharply with older men, whose satisfaction fell along with their relative earnings. We see the life satisfaction results as indirect evidence that younger men experienced relatively little decline in the consumption and greatly valued their improved leisure options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of young men’s time which in past decades was spent working is now spent playing video games, according to Aguiar and Hurst. Given that reported happiness moved in the opposite direction from wages and employment rate, it would seem there is some preference for this specific type of leisure over the purchasing power sacrificed in the form of foregone wages. But given that leisure activities have always been an alternative to work, we should ask what about video games specifically makes them more compelling than historical leisure activities.</p>



<h3 id="decreasing-cost-increasing-availability-and-increasing-quality-of-media-entertainment">Decreasing Cost, Increasing Availability, and Increasing Quality of Media Entertainment</h3>

<p>Video games are just one example of media entertainment content that has become more a more attractive leisure choice as a result of advances in internet and mobile device technology.</p>

<p>For most of history, media consumption was bounded, like other forms of consumption, by cost – if you wanted more books, movies, music, console video games, etc, you needed money to buy them. Notable exceptions to this pattern were radio and cable television, where you could access programming at all hours of the day for a low fixed cost (or in some cases for free) – but in these cases, limits on the syndication of premium content entailed that not every hour of watching was equally enjoyable, and there were generally still diminishing (enjoyment) returns on each additional hour spent watching.</p>

<p>The digitization of content enabled infinite storage of evergreen content in the cloud and effectively zero marginal distribution cost of content through copying. Enabling on-demand access to all of the content that has ever been produced entailed a huge increase in the supply of good content. This essentially made all of history a viable competitor to people producing new content. Similarly, social media–produced for free, by amateurs–provided another huge influx of new content and more competition for attention.</p>

<p>This increased supply and competition put pressure on professionals creating new content to make it better and cheaper. On top of that, taking a page from the cable TV playbook, internet media distributors gave away content for free, and used advertising subsidies to pay for the small amount of content that was still being professionally produced.</p>

<p>All of these changes benefited the consumer by making more and better content available for free. Today, you can pretty much always spend yet another hour consuming some new and interesting content freely available on the internet, so once you have paid the (quite cheap) cost of access to your ISP or mobile data provider, you no longer require additional wages to pay for additional consumption of media as a leisure activity.</p>

<h3 id="decreasing-signalling-utility-of-conspicuous-consumption-goods">Decreasing Signalling Utility of Conspicuous Consumption Goods</h3>

<p>Before we accept that young men are simply foregoing working in favor of spending more time playing video games or consuming other forms of media entertainment content, we should ask what else they might spend foregone earnings on and why they are not working to fund that spend.</p>

<p>In general there are three types of goods: goods that meet your basic needs, leisure goods (including media goods), and conspicuous consumption goods (those that signal genetic fitness, social status, belonging, etc.). If young men playing video games are not foregoing their basic needs (an assumption we’ll make here), and the cost of media entertainment goods has dramatically fallen, then they must be trading off consumption goods. Next, we argue that this group has decreased consumption because the signaling utility of these goods has decreased.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-conspicuous-consumption-and-what-does-it-take-to-get-it">What is conspicuous consumption and what does it take to get it?</h4>

<p>Historically, the primary purpose of working was to generate enough income to satisfy basic needs. Once those needs were met, an individual had a tradeoff to make between spending their remaining time on work or leisure.</p>

<p>Observing the behavior of the nouveau riche in a post-industrialization society in the late 1800s, Thorstein Veblen introduced the theory of conspicuous consumption - the purchase of goods and services for the sake of signalling social status (vs. the intrinsic function provided by goods that meet basic needs or those that enable leisure).</p>

<p>As living standards improved in the 20th century and individuals had more discretionary income, this behavior expanded to men, women, and children across all economic classes who began to spend more money on goods and services as a sort of social fashion. Implicit in spending more time on work is a preference for conspicuous consumption over leisure.</p>

<p>If you have the money, how do you decide what to consume? Benjamin Schwarz suggested in his <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-new-elites-silly-virtue-signaling-consumption/">review</a> of Elizabeth Currid-Halkett’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sum-Small-Things-Theory-Aspirational/dp/0691162735">The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This process depends on the great extent to which the elite’s consumption is at once devoted to and relies on “cultural capital”—that is, the adoption of values, tastes, and norms through social inculcation and formal education. That cup of Intelligentsia coffee may “only” cost five dollars, but learning about it in the first place depends on prizing the judgment of certain cultural tastemakers (again, say, the New York Times and those right-thinking podcasts), and on possessing a worldview that attaches a particular value and virtue to a particular container of hot liquid. Acquiring that cultural capital is, itself, a rarefied and usually expensive endeavor, because it involves a lengthy and complex process of what the sociologists call cultural and social formation: The peculiar cachet that the educated class attaches to that cup of coffee is far more likely to elude the daughter of an insurance adjuster brought up in Lansing, Kansas (a middle-class suburb of Kansas City), who attended the local high school and Kansas State, than it is the daughter of a screenwriter raised in uber-achieving north-of-Montana-Avenue Santa Monica, who attended the Harvard-Westlake School and Yale. Thus, buying that cup of coffee—or that organic cotton t-shirt, or that subscription to Harper’s—signifies a class identity that the purchase, in turn, reinforces.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increased cost in time to acquire the knowledge of what to consume is yet another way that conspicuous consumption is becoming prohibitively more expensive.</p>

<p>The catch with all of this is that the psychological utility sought from conspicuous consumption is relative, not absolute. Sarah Perry sums this up nicely in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290">Every Cradle is a Grave</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than anything, however, a human utility function is a function of social belonging. That’s the ultimate point not only of income, but of intelligence, beauty, and many other material and non-material goods: they may be traded for social belonging… We want income because we want to be able to get the attention of others. We want a safe social place, primarily—and, of course, we want a better social place than the one we currently occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The implication of this relative sizing up is that there is an ever-rising bar to maintain or improve your social position relative to the people and communities from which you seek affiliation or belonging. This was never easy given the money and time required, but at least …</p></article></div>

To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>
<p><span>When designing Uber’s failover handler, we wanted to ensure we hit three main criteria that was lacking in existing solutions we assessed:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Maximize the usage of primary domains: </b><span>&nbsp;We needed our failover handling solution to operate in a way to preferentially route traffic to the primary domains, which typically offer the best performance. Maximizing the amount of HTTPS traffic going through these domains ensures lower latency and a better user experience overall.</span></li>
<li><b>Effectively differentiate between network errors and host-level outages: </b><span>The system required a robust mechanism that could confidently identify actual domain failures and lower the probability of switching to an alternate host because of intermittent mobile network connectivity issues.</span></li>
<li><b>Reduce degraded experience during primary domain outages: </b><span>Our failover …</span></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Ever since&nbsp;Google&nbsp;published the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/" target="_blank">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="SRE movemen (opens in a new tab)" href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/06/26/cloud-service-reliability-part-i-apollo-13-to-google-sre/" target="_blank">SRE movemen</a>t has changed how organizations look at&nbsp;reliability, and incident response and management. Not unlike DevOps, working on adopting SRE is resulting in an organizational cultural shift. A shift which is changing how organizations are organized, on how information flows within an organization that would allow for the delivery of more reliable and resilient, dynamic systems. That being said, SRE, that is SRE as defined by Google, is not applicable for most organizations. Organizations need to take the thought process and culture behind Google’s SRE and adapt it just enough to make it suitable and viable for their organization’s business needs. As I see it today, large enterprises are mostly failing at doing this. They are either attempting to adopt SRE in its purest form, not realizing they are not Google, or totally changing (corrupting) it to suit how they do things, how they have always done things, to their broken culture, hence making what they call SRE, SRE in name only.</p>



<blockquote><p>“But, You are Not Google”</p><cite>Me talking to many a CIO/VP of Ops</cite></blockquote>



<p>“But, You are not Google”. This is a common refrain I have said to many a CIO or VP of Ops in companies that I have worked on SRE adoption with. I try to be polite, I promise. But really, they are not Google. In the very initial pages of the Google SRE book, in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/production-environment/" target="_blank">introduction</a> itself, the authors describes why Google developed SRE. They have massive data centers on which their services run. These data centers have a high incidence of hardware failure, given their size. This required Google to have the ability to dynamically move services from one part of the data center to another in a fraction of time. Given the large user base of the deployed services, Google also needed to have extremely fast response times to outages and degradation in quality of service, with minimal impact to the user. Their operations teams had to find a way to handle all these incidents, outages and failures in an automated manner to reduce toil and stress on the team. Their incidents, outages and failures were also very repetitive. Given the homogenous nature of the hardware across their datacenters, and the nature of the services deployed, there were very few outliers. Most tasks could (should) be automated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This led to the development of what we today know as SRE. Google had a team of software developers work in operations with the goal of developing software to handle the vast majority of tasks that were assigned to the system administration teams and incident response teams. As the software got more and more mature, more and more typical tasks had been automated. The humans could then focus on the outliers. On tasks that were not ‘typical’. Reliability Engineering meets software engineering = SRE.</p>



<p>If the 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph in this section is not an apt description of your datacenters and systems you are running, you do not need SRE. Don’t get me wrong, you need (service/system) Reliability Engineering. You still need to automate repetitive, typical tasks in operations. You just don’t need to, and really should not do it the Google way. You are not Google. Very few organizations are.</p>



<h3><strong>SRE for the Enterprise</strong></h3>



<p>So what does SRE in the ‘regular’ Enterprise look like? It may be easier to describe what it does not look like. Here goes:</p>



<ul><li>You are not replacing your current Ops team, your sys admins with software Engineers. You need your ops team. They know how your custom built infrastructure and systems work. They know its idiosyncrasies. They know when Chicago opens to a ticket to say they are offline again, its the network. Yes, its always the network, but the sysadmins know who to ping at Equinix to get it restored pronto. They know how the option trade desk system slows to a grind on Expiration Friday and you just ignore those tickets from traders that day. And even if you wanted to get rid of all the sys admins, can you afford to hire that many software engineers to replace them all? You can barely fill all your open slots on the dev teams. What you need to do is complement your Ops teams with software engineers who can understand what the teams do day-in, day-out and what tasks are repetitive and typical, and then they can develop tools for automated remediation. These software engineers should be embedded in the ops team, not a separate team on the outside. Think <em>Squads.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE is a no-no.&nbsp;First of all <em>&lt;steps on soapbox/&gt;</em> there should NOT be a team called the DevOps team! You created a new silo to do what was supposed to be a movement to eliminate silos? DevOps should be what everyone does. If you do have a separate team to build automation, that is exactly what they are – the automation building team. And that is exactly what they should do – build automation for others to use. They build tools to enable the processes of DevOps. They do NOT use those tools themselves to do any real deployments. Ever. But I leave my true feelings on this for another blog post <em>&lt;steps off soapbox/&gt;</em>.&nbsp; Renaming your DevOps teams as SRE only gets them to leave for better jobs as real SREs elsewhere at better salaries now that they are formally SREs according to their resumes. Don’t do it. DevOps is DevOps. SRE is SRE. They are joined at the hip, but they are different. SREs have a different set of goals from the application development teams – build automation to reduce toil, increase observability, and improve reliability of the systems in production. They should not be building deployment automation or improving test environments to get better quality signals.</li></ul>
</div></div>



<ul><li>SRE is first and foremost about culture. Do you have a culture that is reliability focussed? What does reliability mean to you? Is it <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2017/08/18/cloud-service-reliability-part-3-antifragile-when-devops-met-sre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MTBF or MTTR (opens in a new tab)">MTBF or MTTR</a>? Do you have well defined SLAs (or SLOs)? How do you measure them? Do you meet them? Do you have <a href="https://sdarchitect.blog/2020/01/08/understanding-observability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Observability (opens in a new tab)">Observability</a>? Do you do blameless postmortems of incidents? Are they really blameless? Do you make your developers ‘carry pagers’ and do they do it without fear? Do you deploy on Fridays and sleep well over the weekend?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>I am barely scratching the surface of how SRE needs to be adapted for the enterprise (that is not Google). I would like to hear from you. But instead of leaving a comment on this post, which I perfectly OK with, I would prefer you respond to an <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">SRE survey</a> we recently created. I had the opportunity earlier this year to work with three good friends of mine – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA2fPwBkGJsFLhm7pYTiGv1hOwqc3Vxt1I/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Marc Hornbeek</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAADGJN4BvhODuicPVGeQAljiRCR_Vx66MQM/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Archana Joshi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAJS7zgBfhzivo8mNgusFqmaicqG0wuPYww/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BPkL4y56tRGuL6Jxh%2FELPjQ%3D%3D">Niladri Choudhury</a> on a <em><a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">State of SRE</a></em> survey commissioned by <a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/">Catchpoint</a>. This survey is designed specifically to get a view into how enterprises and other organization not named Google are adopting SRE. If your organization is adopting or thinking of adopting SRE, do take this survey right now. We will be analyzing the results and sharing findings on the current state and trends (this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> year Catchpoint is running a SRE survey) later this Spring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To sweeten the deal, I am offering my time to anyone who completes the survey and wants to talk SRE. Once you complete the survey and want to talk about your SRE adoption or just have questions about SRE, <a href="mailto:sanjeev@sdarchtect.blog">email a screenshot of the completion screen to me</a> and I will schedule a <strong>free 20-minute consult with you and your team</strong>. So, what are you waiting for – click <a href="https://www.research.net/r/SRESurvey2020">here</a> to go to the survey. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/technology/twitter-hackers-interview.html"> New York Times story on the recent Twitter hack</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>Mr. O’Connor said other hackers had informed him that Kirk got access to the Twitter credentials when he found a way into Twitter’s internal Slack messaging channel and saw them posted there, along with a service that gave him access to the company’s servers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s too soon after this incident to put too much faith in the reporting, but let’s assume it’s accurate. A collective cry of “<em>Posting credentials to a Slack channel? How could engineers at Twitter be so stupid?</em>” rose up from the internet. It’s a natural reaction, but it’s not a constructive one.</p>



<p>I don’t personally know any engineers at Twitter, but I have confidence that they have excellent engineers over there, including excellent security folks. So, how do we explain this seemingly obvious security lapse?</p>



<p>The problem is that we on the outside can’t, because we don’t have enough information. This type of lapse is a classic example of a <em>workaround</em>. People in a system use workarounds (they do things the “<em>wrong</em>” way) when there are obstacles to doing things the “right” way.</p>



<p>There are countless possibilities for why people employ workarounds. Maybe some system that’s required for doing it the “right” way is down for some reason, or maybe it simply takes too long or is too hard to do things the “right” way. Combine that with production pressures, and a workaround is born.</p>



<p>I’m willing to bet that there are people in your organization that use workarounds. You probably use some yourself. Identifying those workarounds teaches us something about how the system works, and how people have to do things the “wrong” way to actually get their work done.</p>



<p>Some workarounds, like the Twitter example, are dangerous. But simply observing “they shouldn’t have done that” does nothing to address the problems in the system that motivated the workaround in the first place.</p>



<p>When you see a workaround, don’t ask “how could they be so stupid to do things the obviously wrong way?” Instead, ask “what are the properties of our system that contributed to the development of this workaround?” Because, unless you gain a deeper understanding of your system, the problems that motivated the workaround aren’t going to go away.</p>

	  <p><span color="#51504E">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 
		first rule of hitting was to get a good ball to hit. I learned down to 
		percentage points where those good balls were. The box shows my particular 
		preferences, from what I considered my “happy zone” - where I could hit 
		.400 or better - to the low outside corner - where the most I could hope 
		to bat was .230. Only when the situation demands it should a hitter go 
		for the low-percentage pitch.<p>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some players are better high-ball hitters than 
		low-ball hitters, or better outside than in; each batter should work out 
		his own set of percentages. But more important, each should learn the 
		strike zone, because once pitchers find a batter is going to swing at 
		bad pitches he will get nothing else. The strike zone is approximately 
		seven balls wide (allowing for pitches on the corners). When a batter 
		starts swinging at pitches just two inches out of that zone (shaded area), 
		he has increased the pitcher’s target from approximately 4.2 square feet 
		to about 5.8 square feet - an increase of 37 percent. Allow a pitcher 
		that much of an advantage and you will be a .250 hitter.</p></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this media release used a hypothetical example that suggested that Google used information about users’ health to personalise or target advertisements. Google says that it does not show personalised ads based on health information. This example has been removed from the media release.</em></p>

<p>The ACCC has launched Federal Court proceedings against Google LLC (Google), alleging Google misled Australian consumers to obtain their consent to expand the scope of personal information that Google could collect and combine about consumers’ internet activity, for use by Google, including for targeted advertising.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges Google misled consumers when it failed to properly inform consumers, and did not gain their explicit informed consent, about its move in 2016 to start combining personal information in consumers’ Google accounts with information about those individuals’ activities on non-Google sites that used Google technology, formerly DoubleClick technology, to display ads.</p>

<p>This meant this data about users’ non-Google online activity became linked to their names and other identifying information held by Google. Previously, this information had been kept separately from users’ Google accounts, meaning the data was not linked to an individual user.</p>

<p>Google then used this newly combined information to improve the commercial performance of its advertising businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC also alleges that Google misled consumers about a related change to its privacy policy.</p>

<p>“We are taking this action because we consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Google significantly increased the scope of information it collected about consumers on a personally identifiable basis. This included potentially very sensitive and private information about their activities on third party websites. It then used this information to serve up highly targeted advertisements without consumers’ express informed consent,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>“We allege that Google did not obtain explicit consent from consumers to take this step.”</p>

<p>“The use of this new combined information allowed Google to increase significantly the value of its advertising products, from which it generated much higher profits.”</p>

<p>“The ACCC considers that consumers effectively pay for Google’s services with their data, so this change introduced by Google increased the “price” of Google’s services, without consumers’ knowledge,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>“I agree” notification</strong></p>

<p>The conduct is alleged to have impacted millions of Australians with Google accounts.</p>

<p>From 28 June 2016 until at least December 2018, Google account holders were prompted to click “I agree” to a pop-up notification from Google that purported to explain how it planned to combine their data, and sought the consumers’ consent for this.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some new features for your Google Account</em></p>

	<p><em>We’ve introduced some optional features for your account, giving you more control over the data Google collects and how it’s used, while allowing Google to show you more relevant ads.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notification also stated,&nbsp;<em>“More information will be available in your Google Account making it easier for you to review and control”</em>; and&nbsp;<em>“Google will use this information to make ads across the web more relevant for you.”</em></p>

<p>Before June 2016, Google only collected and used, for advertising purposes, personally identifiable information about Google account users’ activities on Google owned services and apps like Google Search and YouTube.</p>

<p>After June 2016, when consumers clicked on the “I agree” notification, Google began to collect and store a much wider range of personally identifiable information about the online activities of Google account holders, including their use of third-party sites and apps not owned by Google.</p>

<p>Previously, this additional data had been stored separately from a user’s Google account.</p>

<p>Combined with the personal data stored in Google accounts, this provided Google with valuable information with which to sell even more targeted advertising, including through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands.</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that the “I agree” notification was misleading, because consumers could not have properly understood the changes Google was making nor how their data would be used, and so did not - and could not - give informed consent.</p>

<p>“We believe that many consumers, if given an informed choice, may have refused Google permission to combine and use such a wide array of their personal information for Google’s own financial benefit,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy change</strong></p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google stated in its privacy policy that it&nbsp;<em>“will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, Google deleted this statement and inserted the following statement:<em>&nbsp;“[d]epending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy also states:&nbsp;<em>“[w]e will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.”</em></p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that Google did not in fact obtain consumers’ explicit consent for this change to the privacy policy, and that Google’s statement that it would not reduce consumers’ rights without their explicit consent was therefore misleading.</p>

<p>“Google made a clear representation about how it would protect users’ privacy. The ACCC alleges that Google made changes without obtaining the explicit consent it had promised consumers it would obtain before altering how it protected their private information,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick</strong></p>

<p>In 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick, a supplier of ad-serving technology services to publishers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Google now supplies DoubleClick’s services through its Google Ad Manager and Google Marketing Platform brands, which are the leading suppliers of ad-tech intermediary services.</p>

<p>These services track users’ internet activity on third-party sites that display ads through the use of DoubleClick’s advertising technology.</p>

<p>Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick required approval by competition authorities including the US Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. The ACCC also reviewed and cleared this transaction.</p>

<p>FTC and EC cleared the acquisition, and in doing so considered submissions from Google that it would not be able to combine DoubleClick’s data on consumers’ internet activity with its own data about consumers’ activity on Google services because, at the time, DoubleClick’s contracts with its users prevented Google from doing so.</p>

<p>The agencies did not, however, rely on these submissions in clearing the acquisition.</p>

<p>Before 28 June 2016, Google collected and stored this information on a non-personally identifiable basis, as stated in its privacy policy.</p>

<p>On 28 June 2016, it changed its privacy policy by removing the term explaining how it would treat this DoubleClick data.</p>

<p><strong>Images</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the device and Google service being used by the consumer, the notification published by Google from 28 June 2016 was presented in a variety of ways. A copy of the notification in the form published to consumers using desktop devices is provided below for reference.</p>

<p>The relevant changes to Google’s Privacy Policy made on 28 June 2016 are also shown below for reference:</p>



<p>Source: Accessed from https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive?hl=en-US on 24 June 2020</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Google LLC (Google) is a multinational company incorporated in the United States with its headquarters in Mountain View, California. It is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.</p>

<p>Google supplies a range of services to consumers in Australia including Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, Google Play and Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Google also provides advertising services and analytics services to individuals and businesses. Advertising services are provided on Google services, such as Google Search, Google Maps and YouTube, as well as on websites and mobile device based applications not published or controlled by Google that partner with Google to display advertisements.</p>

<p>Google derives the majority of its revenue from its advertising and analytics services.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concise statement has not been attached as it has been filed on a confidential basis pending claims by Google.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I bit the bullet and reformatted my MacBook Pro over the weekend. My motivation for doing this was to start from scratch to figure out what apps I need. I’m documenting the process I followed here. This guide is a work-in-progress.</p>



<h3>Backing Up My Files</h3>



<p>I wanted to keep it simple and work on organizing all of my files later. So I used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bombich.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> to do the hard work with backing up all my files over to my Drobo 5N. This took longer than I expected, so be patient.</p>



<h3>Signing Out</h3>



<p>You’ll need to make sure you sign out and deauthorize applications before you reformat.</p>



<h3>Installing Applications and Configuring</h3>



<p>Since I’m a developer, I’m always on the lookout for MacBook setup guides. I found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/" target="_blank">this</a> impressive guide by Tania Rascia and was inspired to make my own. </p>



<p>After installing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>, here are the apps I installed.</p>



<pre><code>brew install \
  git \
  yarn \
  make 

brew cask install 1password bartender brave-browser carbon-copy-cloner cleanmymac cleanshot screenflow visual-studio-code google-chrome firefox iterm2 docker vlc slack keybase postgres postico postman coda malwarebytes steam dotnet-sdk
</code></pre>



<p>Since I needed to install Mac Store apps, I installed and used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" target="_blank">mas-cli</a>.</p>



<pre><code>brew install mas</code></pre>



<pre><code>mas install 937984704 1091189122 775737590 634148309 441258766 1274495053 568494494 485812721 497799835

# Amphetamine
# Bear
# iA Writer  
# Logic Pro X
# Magnet
# Microsoft To Do 
# Pocket
# TweetDeck
# Xcode</code></pre>



<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cask-versions</a> to install alternative versions of applications that I haven’t upgraded like Alfred.</p>



<pre><code>brew tap homebrew/cask-versions</code></pre>



<pre><code>brew cask install alfred3 # then activated my power pack license</code></pre>



<p>Turn off spotlight keyboard shortcut and set keyboard shortcut to <code>CMD + spacebar</code> for Alfred.</p>



<h3>iTerm2 Setup</h3>



<p>I followed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/kevin-smets/8568070" target="_blank">this</a> to setup my iTerm2.</p>



<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>



<pre><code>{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "workbench.colorTheme": "New Moon",
    "terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
    "terminal.integrated.shell.osx": "/bin/zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "MesloLGS NF",
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "terminal.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminal.background": "#002833",
        "terminal.ansiBlack": "#003541",
        "terminal.ansiBlue": "#268bd2",
        "terminal.ansiCyan": "#2aa198",
        "terminal.ansiGreen": "#859901",
        "terminal.ansiMagenta": "#d33682",
        "terminal.ansiRed": "#dc322f",
        "terminal.ansiWhite": "#eee8d5",
        "terminal.ansiYellow": "#b58901",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlack": "#586e75",
        "terminal.ansiBrightBlue": "#839496",
        "terminal.ansiBrightCyan": "#93a1a1",
        "terminal.ansiBrightGreen": "#586e75",
        "terminal.ansiBrightMagenta": "#6c6ec6",
        "terminal.ansiBrightRed": "#cb4b16",
        "terminal.ansiBrightWhite": "#fdf6e3",
        "terminal.ansiBrightYellow": "#657b83",
        "terminalCursor.foreground": "#839496",
        "terminalCursor.background": "#003541"
    }
}</code></pre>



<h3>Setting Up A Directory Structure for Projects</h3>



<p>I recommend using Stuart Ellis’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.stuartellis.name/articles/mac-setup/#setting-up-a-directory-structure-for-projects" target="_blank">directory structure</a> for projects, which looks like this for me.</p>



<pre><code>code/
  src/
    github.com/
      westerncj/
        a-project/
    gitlab.com/
      cwestern/
        b-project/</code></pre>

        <h3>What is this site?</h3>
        <p>I want to track how coverage of COVID-19 changes over time and pinpoint precisely when the virus stops being front-page news. More directly, I want to know when we will have three consecutive days where COVID-19-related news is not front-page news? This is a simple implementation that downloads a PDF of the New York Times front page and looks for the following keywords: corona, covid, virus, pandemic, wuhan. </p>

  <p><span>24 Jul 2020</span></p><p>Dependency Inject (DI) is one of the most notable practices to create reliable and high-quality software. This effort enables us to keep the extensibility without losing readability and testability. You may have encountered a situation where you would want to replace any objects in the software flexibly like me. Many frameworks or libraries are allowing us to make use of the dependency injection in our software project. In my case, I would like to use <a href="https://dagger.dev/">Dagger</a> in our web application using <a href="https://www.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard</a>. But I was ignorant of what Dagger was and how to use it in our Dropwizard project. Hence, this article is for writing down the process to get started with Dagger in your web application using Dropwizard.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dagger">What is Dagger</h2>

<p>First of all, what is Dagger? Dagger is a Java-based dependency injection library originally invented by <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>. For now, it’s mainly maintained by Google as an open-source project.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.lewuathe.com/assets/img/posts/2020-07-24-how-to-inject-jersey-resource-in-dropwizard-with-dagger/dagger.png" alt="Dagger"></p>

<p>You might hear about <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a> before, which is also maintained by Google. It has a more extended history than Dagger. Despite that, Dagger has a more significant number of stars in <a href="https://github.com/google/dagger">its GitHub repository</a>. Why is Dagger more popular than Guice? There are several reasons from my perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dagger is compiling time DI library, while Guice’s injection happens at runtime</li>
  <li>Guice often causes challenging error to solve relating to its reflection usage</li>
  <li>Dagger provides more simple APIs to use</li>
  <li>Dagger has notable use cases due to the adoption in the Android development</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, I try to use Dagger in our web application this time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-integrate-dagger-in-dropwizard-project">How to integrate Dagger in Dropwizard project</h2>

<p>What I’m going to do is integrate Dagger in a Dropwizard project to inject Jersey resources flexibly. Before going deeper into this goal, we need to be familiar with some Dagger terminologies.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Module</code>: Has associations between the interface and actual injected objects.</li>
  <li><code>Component</code>: Constructs a whole graph resolving the dependencies of injected objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike Guice, what I’ve found is that we needed to construct one more class called <code>Component</code>. The component is a sort of highest level class managing all objects injected by Dagger. Therefore, all objects should be injected from the component.</p>

<p>In our case, we will create <code>WebResourceModule</code> for the module and <code>WebappComponent</code> for the component.</p>

<p>The client of the injected class can use the <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> annotation. Constructor injection or field injection is recommended in Dagger.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/users"</span><span>)</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserResource</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>@Inject</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>UserResource</span><span>(</span><span>UserConfig</span> <span>userConfig</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Used for the user resource specific configuration</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>config</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We are going to inject <code>UserConfig</code> as we like by using Dagger.</p>

<p>The dagger library can be imported with the following code in <code>build.gradle</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>dependencies</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>implementation</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.28.1'</span>
  <span>annotationProcessor</span> <span>'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.28.1'</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="module-and-component">Module and Component</h2>

<p>First, we define the module to illustrate how to construct the target <code>UserConfig</code> class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Module</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dagger.Provides</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Module</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>final</span> <span>UserConfig</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>configuration</span><span>.</span><span>getUserConfig</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@Provides</span>
    <span>UserConfig</span> <span>provideUserConfig</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>userConfig</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>@Provides</code> annotation lets the compiler know how to construct the class at the compile time. Therefore, all classes in the application use the <code>UserConfig</code> constructed by the method, <code>provideUserConfig</code>. Next, we can create a module class for building the whole dependency graph.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>dagger.Component</span><span>;</span>

<span>@Component</span><span>(</span><span>modules</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>WebResourceModule</span><span>.</span><span>class</span><span>})</span>
<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>UserResource</span> <span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The argument of <code>@Component</code> annotation specifies the modules knowing how to construct the injected objects. All <code>WebappComponent</code> interface needs to provide is the method to build the object we finally want to get. In this case, the web resource which will be registered into the Dropwizard later. That’s all that we must do with Dagger.</p>

<p>But here comes one question. Who creates the instance of <code>WebappComponent</code>? The answer is Dagger. Dagger generates a class prefixed by <code>Dagger</code>. In this case, <code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> will be created to construct the <code>UserResource</code> from it. Additionally, it provides us a way to bind a module at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="dropwizard-application">Dropwizard Application</h2>

<p>In the Dropwizard, we will get the component class to get the <code>UserResource</code> and register it as a jersey resource.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Application</span> <span>extends</span> <span>io</span><span>.</span><span>dropwizard</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Configuration</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>[]</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>new</span> <span>Application</span><span>().</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>run</span><span>(</span><span>@NotNull</span> <span>Configuration</span> <span>configuration</span><span>,</span> <span>Environment</span> <span>environment</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Bind the module to inject the user configuration</span>
    <span>// All objects dependent on the UserConfig can change the behavior without rewriting them.</span>
    <span>WebappComponent</span> <span>component</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                                <span>new</span> <span>WebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                        <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

    <span>environment</span><span>.</span><span>jersey</span><span>().</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>component</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>DaggerWebappComponent</code> has a builder interface to bind the module at runtime. By changing the module here, we can change the behavior. For the test purpose, we can write a component like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WebappComponent</span> <span>testComponent</span> <span>=</span> <span>DaggerWebappComponent</span><span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>()</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>webResourceModule</span><span>(</span>
                            <span>new</span> <span>TestWebResourceModule</span><span>(</span><span>configuration</span><span>)</span>
                    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>();</span>

<span>UserResource</span> <span>testUserResource</span> <span>=</span> <span>testComponent</span><span>.</span><span>getUserResource</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It obviously helps us write more testable code.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>

<p>As we saw now, using a Dagger looks easy. Dagger enabled me to write more maintainable code without learning many things. Its simple APIs significantly reduce the trouble and burden to employ the DI framework in our software projects. Let’s try to use Dagger in your Dropwizard project as well!</p>

He says, “All BS. I wasn’t meant for educators, as those are actually their issues with me (i.e. teaching disabilities).”</p><p>He’s an inspiration as I’ve faced similar obstacles especially with the focus of compliance in the educational system over creativity, curiosity, even intellect has <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">hurt me in my educational career</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Should You Care?</h2><p>I started writing these <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank">essays</a> and making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU87CN_FxGC1q3hzWM0CCDA" target="_blank">videos</a> because <strong>ideas are the currency of the 21st century. </strong>I humbly believe the ideas I share could help others as I pursue my <a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.substack.com/" target="_blank">Curiosities</a><em>.</em></p><p>Eric Weinstein’s ideas have awakened me and showed a world unknown to most people, such as the real world of academia and science.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these ideas is what he calls the <strong>DISC</strong> (Distributed Idea Suppression Complex) which explains how disruptive and innovative ideas that challenge the status quo are suppressed. Keeping institutions safe from individuals who create change.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is spread throughout major institutions such as in academia, the mainstream media, and politics. It tries to undermine ideas that may challenge or weaken the elite. This isn’t directly planned, and it’s not under central control.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric and his family have been victims of the DISC multiple times. Eric in physics, his wife in economics, and his brother in biology. He started noticing the same pattern in politics when MSNBC hid polling graphics of presidential candidate Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p><p>The DISC is only one of these marvelous ideas that Eric explores in his podcast called The Portal where he explores subjects including science, economics, culture, politics, and business.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal of the show is to help you see the world through a different lens, which opens up your mind to new ways of viewing events and your life. Each guest is a portal to a reality showcasing what we would normally consider impossible, are indeed possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s visit The Portal!</p><h2>Favorite Episodes</h2><p>Eric launched The Portal in June 2019 and less than a year later has created a community of people who want to explore this hidden reality and discover new portals.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric has wide expertise in many fields, but what’s interesting is how he engages your mind, moves your heart, and lights a spark in your soul. Eric can discover unexplored worlds and bring them back to his audience. Sometimes, complex or hard to understand, but always interesting where you get the sense of upgrading your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my favorite episodes:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s" target="_blank"><strong>1: Peter Thiel:</strong></a><strong> </strong>this was how I found the podcast. Peter rarely appears on interviews, so I knew this one had to be special. Peter Thiel is one of the most influential and contrarian thinkers of the last decades. He’s also the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir. He was also the first big investor in Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter and Eric challenge our way of thinking and encourage us to see things differently. For instance, they discussed the relationship between growth and violence. Thiel argues that if economic growth is low, violence is more likely to arise. He highlights that violence among humans is high because according to Rene Girard, we want what other people want, giving rise to conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>This may be one of the best episodes in the history of podcasts. I found this conversion can help you understand Girard’s theories' implications in society, especially in a time of wealth gap inequality, racial conflicts, and a pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>They also discussed the era of stagnation, the future of education, student debt, the broken world of academia, and polymaths.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter (a conservative) and Eric (a progressive) discuss ideas with unique and often opposing views as they try to find a solution and reach an agreement on his arguments.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000462975502" target="_blank"><strong>19: Bret Weinstein - The Prediction and the DISC:</strong></a><strong> </strong>In this rigid conversation with Bret, they talked about the DISC and how it affected Bret with one of his biology discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Eric eagerly tries to get his brother to tell the story of his powerful finding. Bret discovered that the mice we use for medical trials have ultra-long telomeres (something humans don’t have) and that these “hide” the dangers of certain medicines. This same discovery could cure cancer and end aging.&nbsp;</p><p>After he discovered this, he tried to go the usual path of peer-review and so on. According to the podcast, he was silenced. Yet his findings were taken and made someone else the Nobel Prize winner.&nbsp;</p><p>A mind-blowing episode that will stir your curiosity and make you learn about the findings, the DISC, and The Portal.</p><p><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000460365533" target="_blank"><strong>17: Anna Khachiyan - Reconstructing The Mystical Feminine From The Ashes Of “The Feminine Mystique”:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Eric interviews Anna, who is a Russian-American social, literary and artistic theorist. She is also the co-host of the fierce and popular Red Scare podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the conversation, Eric tells her, “I've been addicted to your podcast not quite understanding why. It's one of the strangest things I've ever found.” That’s exactly how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>They talked about mystery and how society thought we wanted clarity and directness. But what we actually want is mystery, especially in our relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, they talked about the importance of mystery and what it means to be mysterious. This episode will help you perceive the significance of how we can use mystery in our lives.</p><p>I’ll be honest, I don’t know why I liked this episode, but I listened to it several times and it was weirdly fascinating.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BONUS </strong><a href="https://plinkhq.com/i/1469999563/e/1000477637846" target="_blank"><strong>36: Dark Matter, Black Matters and All That Jazz</strong></a><strong> </strong>with Stephon Alexander is an amazing episode to learn more about physics, racial issues, and music.&nbsp;</p><h2>Geometrically Unified</h2><p>I disagree with many of Eric’s views, however I still consider him a role model because of his love and passion for science. He proposed a theory of everything called Geometric Unity where he tried to explain and combine all physical aspects of the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>I love learning about science. I read books, email experts, watch interviews, write essays, and listen to podcasts like The Portal to learn more about science.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Science</strong> combined with <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> has the power to create a world of progress and technological advancement, so we create a world of equality, fairness, and peace.&nbsp; That’s what I hope to do with my life.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you find Eric’s work as interesting, fascinating, and curious as I have.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://jenvermet.com/" target="_blank">Jen</a>, <a href="https://salman.io/" target="_blank">Salman</a>, <a href="https://juliasaxena.com/" target="_blank">Julia</a>, and <a href="https://fullofkrapp.com/" target="_blank">Kevin</a>  for reading drafts of this essay. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595770382135_5451"><p>If you’re into interesting ideas (like the one you just read), join us at our<a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter"> </a><a href="https://juandavidcampolargo.com/newsletter" target="_blank"><strong>newsletter</strong></a>, and I’ll send you new essays right when they come out. <br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <hr> 
<p>I manage this website with markdown and a shell scripts. Hereâ€™s how.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast load time</li>
<li>Minimal Interface</li>
<li>A site directory</li>
<li>Readable URLs</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>A fancy framework</li>
<li>Site analytics/admin interface</li>
<li>Large files</li>
<li>Ads</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent some time in HTML/CSS designing a header for the site. This includes a generic title for each page, an â€œAboutâ€� tab, â€œPostsâ€� tab, â€œContactâ€� tab, and horizontal bar to separate the header from the body. I linked each tab to the URL I planned for each page, which is my domain (jarbus.net) followed by the filename with the <code>.html</code> extension removed. (e.g.Â&nbsp;jarbus.net/About)</p>
<p>I write all my posts in markdown, then convert it to HTML using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a conversion script to turn an HTML file for a post into an HTML file for the site. I accomplish this by creating a new file consisting of the header HTML mentioned, concatenating with the post HTML afterwards. I also run a <code>sed</code> command to replace the generic title in the header for the filename of the post, with dashes replaced with spaces.</p>
<p>I keep my markdown files in a directory called â€œdraftsâ€�, which is sibling to the GitHub Pages repository thatâ€™s hosting my website. When Iâ€™m done with a post, I convert it to a site page, move it to the git repository, then push. Itâ€™s that easy!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/About">About</a>, <a href="http://jarbus.net/jarbus.net">Index</a>, and <a href="http://jarbus.net/Contact">Contact</a> pages all maintained as above. I used to have a script to automatically recreate my <a href="http://jarbus.net/Posts">Posts</a> page to add new entries, but found that I much prefer the curated &amp; categorical page I have now.</p>

<p>I also have an <a href="http://jarbus.net/feed">rss feed</a>, which I update manually. However, given that adding a new entry simply requires putting</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    PostName
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link&gt;
    https://www.jarbus.net/PostName
  &lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;</code></pre>
<p>at the top of my feed file, I think Iâ€™ll manage. Plus, I enjoy the ability add custom tags on a post by post basis if I decide to.</p>

<p>Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with how the site turned outâ€“I have absolute control over all aspects of my blog while doing negligible content management. I have lighting-fast load times, a minimal interface, and can fix any aspect of my site were something to break.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This essay is an illustrated proof of the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem; the NFL theorem has many variants, which all say slightly different things. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem">most famous one</a> says, roughly, that every learning algorithm has the same performance, when averaged across all possible target functions. In other words, there is no universal learning algorithm that outperforms every other algorithm on every learning task.</p>

<p>Throughout this essay, I'm going to be refering to a "learning algorithm". If you're unfamiliar, in the machine learning context, a learning algorithm is an algorithm that takes in \(S\), a series of (x,y) pairs, i.e. our training data or training set, from some target function and outputs a hypothesis, which is a function that tries to be close to the original target function. Note that the inputs and outputs aren't necessarily  binary, but it's easier to illustrate them as such, and the proof is not affected. Learning algorithms are often evaluated by looking at the error rate, which in the case of classification, is the proportion of \((x,y)\) pairs it predicts incorrectly.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/hypothesis.svg"></p>

<p>In this essay, I will focus on an easier NFL theorem (from <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/%7Eshais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/index.html">Understanding Machine Learning by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David</a>) which says, roughly, for any learning algorithm that outputs a binary function, there exists a distribution that will cause it to output a hypothesis with a high error rate, even when there exists another function that can achieve 0 error on the distribution. In other words, for every learning algorithm, we can find a distribution that can trip up the learning algorithm.</p>

<p>How do we formalize this? </p>

<p>The NFL theorem we're going to prove states that:</p>

<p>Say we have a learning algorithm A which outputs a binary classifier (this is our hypothesis) over a domain \(X\). </p>

<p>Next, let's define an error or loss function, which will tell us how well our output hypothesis does on the actual distribution. We'll use the <strong>1</strong> loss function \(L\) which, when given two inputs, outputs 0 if the two values match, otherwise it outputs 1. Then, there exists a distribution \(D\) over \(X \times \{0,1\}\) (i.e. a distribution over possible \((x,\{0,1\})\) values) such that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There exists a function \(f: X \to \{0,1\}\) with \(L_D(f) = 0\). That is, there is some binary function over \(X\) such that the expected loss of \(f\) over \(D\) is 0. In other words, there is some function which will correctly classify all the points in our distribution correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>With probability of at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) over the choice of \(S \sim D^m\) \(L_D(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}\). In other words, for at least \(\frac{1}{7}\) of all possible training sets of size \(m\) from \(D\), the expected loss of output of the training algorithm on the training set is at least  \(\frac{1}{8}\). (Note that our loss function is defined here as the average <strong>1</strong> loss across all points in the distribution).</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution \(D\) is defined over \(2m\) points, so our training set will consist of at most \(m\) unique values, i.e. half of the distribution's points. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/nfl-base.svg"></p>

<p>To prove this, we are actually going to prove something different, but equivalent. Instead, we are going to prove that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))] \ge 1/4\)</p>

<p>That is, if we run our learning algorithm on training sets of size \(m\), across a family of distributions \(D_1-D_T\), the largest such expected loss will be at least \(\frac{1}{4}\). In other words, we will show that at least one distribution \(D_i\) from this group will trip up our algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/dist-one-fourth-error.svg"></p>

<p>To see how these two statements are equivalent, we just apply a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov%27s_inequality">Markvov's inequality</a>. This lower bounds how likely a random variable is to be greater than some value:</p>

<p>\(P(X \ge a) \ge \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]-a}{1-a}\)</p>

<p>Applying that to our inequality above, we see that:</p>

<p>\(P(L_{D_i}(A(S)) \ge \frac{1}{8}) \ge \frac{\frac{1}{4}-\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{7}{8}} \ge \frac{1}{7}\) as desired. So now we just need prove this new inequality.</p>

<p>Before that, here's the intuition for why this inequality is true:</p>

<p>First, our learning algorithm only gets half of all possible points as its training set. This means our algorithm knows nothing about the labels of the other half of the points. Now, if we assume that every function over these unknown points is equally likely, then each point is either 1 or a 0. This means that our algorithm can only guess for these unknown points, which makes its expected error rate 0.5. So in the best case, it'll still get an error rate of 0 on the half it sees and 0.5 on the half it doesn't see, which makes its overall error 0.25.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/seen-unseen-data.svg"></p>

<h3>The Proof</h3>

<p>Now, let's begin the proof.</p>

<p>Let \(C \subseteq X\) such that \(|C| = 2m\). So it's a subset of our input space that's of size \(2m\). </p>

<p>Notice that there are \(T = 2^{2m}\) possible functions from \(C\) to \(\{0,1\}\).  Let \(D_i\) be the distribution over \(D\) that only assigns probability to the \((x,f_i(x))\) pairs for the corresponding function. This captures the idea that our input space \(C\) is twice the size of our training set, and that each function is equally likely. </p>

<p>Each function is now turned into a probability distribution that places \(\frac{1}{|C|}\) probability if the given \((x,y)\) point is one of the function's input/output pairs, and 0 probability otherwise. So each unique function has a unique distribution associated with it.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/function-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Recall that we're trying to calculate \(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\), i.e. the expected loss over all possible training examples, with regards to the distribution that maximizes this loss. </p>

<p>For any given distribution,  \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}} [L_{D_i}(A(S))]\) is the loss for a given training set, averaged over all possible choices of training data. </p>

<p>If our input space consists of \(2m\) points and our training data consists of a sequence of \(m\) points, then there are \(k = (2m)^m\) possible sequences. </p>

<p>Below, we'll let \(S_j^i\) be the \(i^{th}\) possible sequence of training data, labeled with the \(j^{th}\) possible function. </p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sij.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus, we know that \(\underset{S \sim D_i^m}{\mathbb{E}}[L_{D_i}(A(S))] = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\). In other words, for any one given distribution of data, the expected loss of our learning algorithm (across all training data sets) is equal to the expected loss if we take \(m\) training points, averaged across all possible functions that could label the data.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-distr-error.svg"> </p>

<p>Recall that, from above, we care about taking the <strong>maximum</strong> error across all possible distributions; by definition, this will be at least as big as the <strong>average</strong> loss across all distributions. Thus, we know that:</p>

<p>\(\underset{i \in [T]}{\text{max }} \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^kL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-distr-training.svg"> </p>

<p>Next, it doesn't really matter if we take the average over all distributions first or the average over all training sets first. Thus, we can switch the order of the summations to get the same value:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) =\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-training-distr.svg"></p>

<p>Now, if we're taking the loss averaged over all training data, notice that this will necessarily have to be at least as big as the loss given by the training data which leads to the <strong>smallest</strong> average loss. </p>

<p>Thus, we can replace our inequality with a smaller, simpler one. Our inequality has to be at least as large as the average loss (across all functions) when applied to that specific training set.</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{k}\sum^k_{j=1}\frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{i=1}L_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \underset{j \in [k]}{\text{min }} \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j))\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-training-error.svg"> </p>

<p>So we've been abstractly talking about the loss function for a while now. What does \(L_{D_i}(h)\) actually represent? We want it to be how well our hypothesis does on a specific distribution \(D_i\). One straightforward way to formalize this is to just go through all \((x,y)\) pairs in \(D_i\) and take the average <strong>1</strong> loss between \(y\) and \(h(x)\):</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss.svg"></p>

<p>Next, let's fix some \(j \in [k]\), which has \(m\) training examples given by \(S_j = (x_1,..,x_m)\). Let \((v_1, ...,v_p)\) be the examples in \(C\) (all data points) that <strong>aren't</strong> in \(S_j\). We can see that \(p \ge m\) because at most we have half the data from the distribution, which is when we have no duplicates.</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/p-data.svg"> </p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>\(L_{D_i}(h) =\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{x\in C}\mathbf{1}[h(x) \not= f_i(x)] \ge \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/loss-p.svg"> </p>

<p>In other words, the average loss over all points in the distribution is at least half of the average loss over all points <strong>not</strong> in the training set. </p>

<p>Now, we can substitutue this in for \(L_{D_i}\) from our inequality earlier to get:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^TL_{D_i}(A(S^i_j)) \ge \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p>So now we're taking the loss across all functions, across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\). Like before, we can swap the order of the summations:</p>

<p>\( \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] =\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/sum-p-dist.svg"></p>

<p>Once again, we can upper bound this inequality by noticing that the average loss across all points in \((v_1,...,v_p)\) and across all functions has to be at least the loss of the point \(v_r\) which we assume to be the point which gives the minimal loss:</p>

<p>\(\frac{1}{2p}\sum_{j=1}^p\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_j) \not= f_i(v_j)] \ge \frac{1}{2}\underset{r \in [p]}{\text{min}}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^T \mathbf{1}[h(v_r) \not= f_i(v_r)]\)</p>

<p><img src="https://mlu.red/images/one-p-error.svg"></p>

<p>Now, notice that we can partition \([T]\) into \((f_a, f_b)\) pairs such that \(f_a\) and \(f_b\) agree on every value except …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In modern computer programming, concurrency is often required to accelerate solving a problem. In Python programming, we usually have the three library options to achieve concurrency, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html"><code>multiprocessing</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html"><code>threading</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html"><code>asyncio</code></a>. Recently, I was aware that as a scripting language Python’s behavior of concurrency has subtle differences compared to the conventional compiled languages such as C/C++.</p>



<p><a href="https://realpython.com/">Real Python</a> has already given a good <a href="https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/">tutorial</a> with <a href="https://github.com/realpython/materials/tree/master/concurrency-overview">code examples</a> on Python concurrency. In this blog post, I would like to discuss the <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code> in Python from a high-level, with some additional caveats that the Real Python tutorial has not mentioned. I have also borrowed some good diagrams from their tutorial and the readers should give the credits to them on those illustrations.</p>

<h3 id="cpu-bound-vs-io-bound">CPU-Bound VS I/O-Bound</h3>

<p>The problems that our modern computers are trying to solve could be generally categorized as CPU-bound or I/O-bound. Whether the problem is CPU-bound or I/O-bound affects our selection from the concurrency libraries <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>threading</code>, and <code>asyncio</code>. Of course, in some scenarios, the algorithm design for solving the problem might change the problem from CPU-bound to I/O-bound or vice versa. The concept of CPU-bound and I/O-bound are universal for all programming languages.</p>

<h4 id="cpu-bound">CPU-Bound</h4>

<p>CPU-bound refers to a condition when the time for it to complete the task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor. The faster clock-rate CPU we have, the higher performance of our program will have.</p>

<div>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Synchronous for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of single computer programs are CPU-bound. For example, given a list of numbers, computing the sum of all the numbers in the list.</p>

<h4 id="io-bound">I/O-Bound</h4>

<p>I/O bound refers to a condition when the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed. This is the opposite of a task being CPU bound. Increasing CPU clock-rate will not increase the performance of our program significantly. On the contrary, if we have faster I/O, such as faster memory I/O, hard drive I/O, network I/O, etc, the performance of our program will boost.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>Most of the web service related programs are I/O-bound. For example, given a list of restaurant names, finding out their ratings on Yelp.</p>

<h3 id="process-vs-thread-in-python">Process VS Thread in Python</h3>

<h4 id="process-in-python">Process in Python</h4>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">global interpreter lock</a> (GIL) is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronize the execution of threads so that only one native thread can execute at a time. An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one native thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor. Note that the native thread here is the number of threads in the physical CPU core, instead of the thread concept in the programming languages.</p>



<p>Because Python interpreter uses GIL, a single-process Python program could only use one native thread during execution. That means single-process Python program could not utilize CPU more than 100% (we define the full utilization of a native thread to be 100%) regardless whether it is single-process single-thread or single-process multi-thread. Conventional compiled programming languages, such as C/C++, do not have interpreter, not even mention GIL. Therefore, for a single-process multi-thread C/C++ program, it could utilize many CPU cores and many native threads, and the CPU utilization could be greater than 100%.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, we would have to write multi-process Python program to maximize its performance.</p>

<h4 id="thread-in-python">Thread in Python</h4>

<p>Because a single-process Python could only use one CPU native thread. No matter how many threads were used in a single-process Python program, a single-process multi-thread Python program could only achieve at most 100% CPU utilization.</p>



<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, single-process multi-thread Python program would not improve the performance. However, this does not mean multi-thread is useless in Python. For a I/O-bound task in Python, multi-thread could be used to improve the program performance.</p>

<h3 id="multiprocessing-vs-threading-vs-asyncio-in-python">Multiprocessing VS Threading VS AsyncIO in Python</h3>

<h4 id="multiprocessing">Multiprocessing</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>multiprocessing</code>, we are able to run a Python using multiple processes. In principle, a multi-process Python program could fully utilize all the CPU cores and native threads available, by creating multiple Python interpreters on many native threads. Because all the processes are independent to each other, and they don’t share memory. To do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>multiprocessing</code>, it requires to use the API provided the operating system. Therefore, there will be slightly large overhead.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/CPUMP.webp">
    <figcaption>Multi-Process for CPU-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a CPU-bound task in Python, <code>multiprocessing</code> would be a perfect library to use to maximize the performance.</p>

<h4 id="threading">Threading</h4>

<p>Using Python <code>threading</code>, we are able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. By overlapping the waiting time for requests, we are able to improve the performance. In addition, because all the threads share the same memory, to do collaborative tasks in Python using <code>threading</code>, we would have to be careful and use locks when necessary. Lock and unlock make sure that only one thread could write to memory at one time, but this will also introduce some overhead. Note that the threads we discussed here are different to the native threads in CPU core. The number of native threads in CPU core is usually 2 nowadays, but the number of threads in a single-process Python program could be much larger than 2.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/Threading.webp">
    <figcaption>Single-Process Multi-Thread for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Therefore, for a I/O-bound task in Python, <code>threading</code> could be a good library candidate to use to maximize the performance.</p>



<p>It should also be noted that all the threads are in a pool and there is an executer from the operating system managing the threads deciding who to run and when to run. This can be a short-coming of <code>threading</code> because the operating system actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at any time to start running a different thread. This is called pre-emptive multitasking since the operating system can pre-empt your thread to make the switch.</p>

<h4 id="asyncio">AsyncIO</h4>

<p>Given <code>threading</code> is using multi-thread to maximize the performance of a I/O-bound task in Python, we wonder if using multi-thread is necessary. The answer is no, if you know when to switch the tasks. For example, for each thread in a Python program using <code>threading</code>, it will really stay idle between the request is sent and the result is returned. If somehow a thread could know the time I/O request has been sent, it could switch to do another task, without staying idle, and one thread should be sufficient to manage all these tasks. Without the thread management overhead, the execution should be faster for a I/O-bound task. Obviously, <code>threading</code> could not do it, but we have <code>asyncio</code>.</p>



<p>Using Python <code>asyncio</code>, we are also able to make better use of the CPU sitting idle when waiting for the I/O. What’s different to <code>threading</code> is that, <code>asyncio</code> is single-process and single-thread. There is an event loop in <code>asyncio</code> which routinely measure the progress of the tasks. If the event loop has measured any progress, it would schedule another task for execution, therefore, minimizing the time spent on waiting I/O. This is also called cooperative multitasking. The tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-07-11-Python-Concurrency-High-Level/Asyncio.webp">
    <figcaption>Single-Process Single-Thread Asynchronous for I/O-Bound</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The short-coming of <code>asyncio</code> is that the even loop would not know what are the progresses if we don’t tell it. This requires some additional effort when we write the programs using <code>asyncio</code>.</p>

Opening the doors to discrimination at work</h3><p>If you don't live in the highest wage city of the world, you might have a peer at the company who lives in a more expensive city than you. Are you ready to be treated as a second-class employee just because of the geography that you live in?</p><p><em>How will you know that all the lousy work doesn't get passed on to you because it is justified in terms of 'returns on investment'?</em></p><p>When your manager has the final say, isn't it possible that they distribute work so that a low-risk, low-impact project is assigned to you while your "more expensive" peers get assigned the high-risk, high impact one?</p><p><strong>HR at your COL company</strong><em>: "We have a policy that says we won't discriminate based on the employee's location."</em></p><p>That's all well and good but what about the silent bias.</p><p><em>How can you be sure that your extremely well-meaning manager wasn't thinking about it when they assign you a project that you don't like? Wouldn't they be making a wise decision that is justified in terms of returns of investment? Can you be sure that they won't?</em></p><h3 id="-2-differences-in-government-spending-across-countries">#2. Differences in Government spending across countries</h3><p>Public spending enables governments to produce and purchase goods and services, in order to fulfil their objectives – such as the provision of public goods or the redistribution of resources - like social protection, education and healthcare.</p><p>Recent data on public spending reveals substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Relative to low-income countries, government expenditure in high-income countries tends to be much larger (both in per capita terms, and as share of GDP), and it also tends to be more focused on social protection.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes!

A broken public hospital infracture means that people need to avail the expensive private hospitals for their healthcare. And a lot of these private enterprises are not above profiteering in times of crises.</p><p><em>How does cost of living based compensation take into account the differences in government spending accross countries?

      <h3>Harry Eng the Master Bottle Filler.</h3>
      <p>Harry was born in 1932 and died in 1996. He was  a school teacher, educational consultant, inventor, and magician. 
        A web search will tell you a little about his many talents but in summary: </p>
      <p><strong>Everything he did was intended to teach you to think. </strong></p>
      <p>Here are some of his bottles that are in the Puzzle Museum.</p>
      
      <p>This bottle contains his "Trademark" knot. It is, as always, too large to come out of the bottle, but also the stick  plus cord is too wide for the neck of the bottle.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>One evening Harry was in a London hotel and decided to visit the Puzzle Museum the next morning. When he and his friends had finished their bottle of wine, he took the bottle up to his room. He then filled it with a book of matches, menu, and the pack of cards as a gift for us. This is a particular favourite as he assured us that the only tools he had were  a pencil and rubber bands. </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>To those of you who give advice on which languages, methodologies, architectures, or whatever else to use, I want to start by saying thank you. Your advice is vital to the growth of millions of people like me who are early in their careers.</p>

<p>But I’ve noticed a pattern with software engineering advice that leads to over-engineering and unnecessary arguments. So I have a request:</p>

<p><em>Please make your advice more specific</em></p>

<p>It’s too often overlooked that there isn’t just one type of “software”, thus it is rare for advice to be applicable to every situation. For example, advice for testing a small B2B web app might not work for embedded device firmware. But it might work for a large B2C web app. And since readers will rarely have experience in all of those situations, I think we should start being more explicit about the applicability of our advice.</p>

<p>Being more specific might help address two big time sinks in the industry:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting">Cargo-culting</a>, like when people read how great Kubernetes works for Netflix, but then they decide to use it for a little Django app (that was me a few years ago).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a>, like when people argue incessantly that a language is useless because it can’t be used in some niche.</li>
</ol>

<p>A good start might be answering questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my scale? (local restaurant website vs. Youtube.com)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of product? (library, web app, CLI tool, firmware, on/off-premise, etc.)</li>
  <li>Does your advice apply to my type of users? (developers, enterprises, regular people, etc.)</li>
  <li>If not, what should I use instead? (like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">replacing Hadoop with <code>find/xargs/awk</code></a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s hard to find the right balance between hand-holding readers or just saying “buyer beware”. But hopefully spending time to add an extra subheading on “Applicability” to READMEs or blog posts will pay for itself in time spent over-engineering and arguing over minutiae.</p>

            <p><span>2020-07-25</span></p><p>I just put <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">resume.md on GitHub</a>. It’s
a Makefile and some CSS that builds a HTML and PDF version of a resume from
plain Markdown source.</p>
<p>Plain text source has all the usual benefits (plays nice with version control,
diff, grep, etc.), but this approach has the additional advantage that it has
very light dependencies: two pure Python packages that can be pip installed
(<a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a> and
<a href="https://weasyprint.org/">weasyprint</a>). You don’t need pandoc or LaTeX.</p>
<p>To use it: clone the repository, install the dependencies, edit the
file
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.md">resume.md</a>
(which is very simple vanilla Markdown), then run <code>make</code>. You’ll get
a HTML file that looks like this <img src="https://mike.place/post/resume.md/resume.png" alt="Screenshot ofresume.html">
and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamsmj/resume.md/main/resume.pdf">PDF that looks very
similar</a>.
Edit the CSS to change fonts, spacing, layout, etc. See <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/resume.md">the README for
more</a>.</p>

a 28-nm FPGA with six 3.125 Gbps transceiver channels from Altera. The board offers a 32-bit wide LPDDR2 DRAM 
memory with 512 Mbytes capacity. This device has a very high bandwidth for many applications. In addition the
board has a HDMI output, an audio device, an SD card interface, many LEDs and switches and some expansion
connectors.
</p>

<p>
The plan is to realize with this board a "multiple computer" system. The name TRIPUTER is an indication of how
many systems will be integrated. The first one will be the PC532 running NetBSD. The second one will be the
Ceres-3 using Oberon. Currently the last one will be the BBC computer with the 32016 Second Processor.
</p>

<p>
Using a commercial board for this purpose is the best choice. Nevertheless the board is not ideal. For example it
lacks an Ethernet port and a real time clock. But it is cheap and the used FPGA is a modern one which will be available
for many years. The missing features can be added through the expansion connectors. I will develop the necessary
hardware for it too. 
</p>

<p>
The three computers to be integrated are very different from a software point of view. Having them available in one
system should be an exciting experience. The FPGA of the board is big enough to hold the required hardware.

<p>
Of course such a complex system is not build over night. But as time goes by the fourth milestone is now achieved
:-)

<h3>Milestone 4 : TRIPUTER V0.3 is available =&gt; updated to V0.33 again due to some issues in the VT100 terminal
emulation.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> version 0.33 of TRIPUTER contains the PC632M system running NetBSD with an SD card. Still this
system uses the USB connection for the RS232 interface. The image for the SD card is available at
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/NetBSD.html">Software/NetBSD</a>. The <a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V033.zip">V0.33 zip archive</a>
contains the following files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V033.sof , the FPGA configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V033.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>output_file.cof , the definition file for Quartus to generate a new pof file
  </li><li>ans32k.exe , the Series 32000 crossassembler for Windows
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
  </li><li>mon_auto.hex , the hex file of the monitor program for PC532
  </li><li>two application programs and a readme.txt
</li></ul>

<p>
The date of the zip-file is 11 May 2019.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> done.</p>

<h3>October 2019 : the PERI board is available!</h3>

<p>
The PERI board is an IO board which brings to the FPGA board some necessary extensions: a true RS232 interface,
a real time clock (RTC), two PS2 ports for mouse and keyboard, a second SD card connector and a 100 Mbit Ethernet
interface. All of these things are now operational. One port is not yet usable: SATA. The hardware is there, but
the verilog code for this challenging interface must still be written.
</p>

<p>
Figure 4 shows the PERI board in action.
</p>

<p><img src="http://cpu-ns32k.net/images/PERI.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig. 4. The PERI board with the serial number 1 is attached to the Cyclone V GX Starter Kit. 2 of the 3 LEDs of
the Ethernet interface are active.</p>

<p>
The purpose of PERI is to transform the Starter Kit into a standalone computer. Then all the planned systems can
be implemented.
</p>

<p>
To test the functions of the PERI board I have made a new version of TRIPUTER: it is V0.9 . The 
<a href="http://cpu-ns32k.net/files/TRIPUTER_V09.zip">V0.9 zip archive</a> contains only three files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRIPUTER_V09.pof , the flash configuration
  </li><li>TRIPUTER_V09.pdf , the User Manual
  </li><li>monitor.32K , the source code of the TRIPUTER MONITOR program
</li></ul>

<p>
The system can only test PERI if the flash is being configured with the pof file. Then some software is available.
I hope that V0.9 will be replaced soon with a version which enables SATA...
</p>

<h3>Milestone 5 : TRIPUTER V1.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V1.0 will be the first system that uses all features of the PERI board. It will emulate
the PC532, run NetBSD from a SATA device and will have an Ethernet interface for easy down- and uploading of big
files.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<h3>Milestone 6 : TRIPUTER V2.0 is available.</h3>

<p>
<b>Description:</b> TRIPUTER V2.0 will contain the Ceres-3 and the PC532.
</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> to be done.</p>

<p>Real entrepreneurs ship, don’t ever forget that. An idea is worthless until it has been translated and executed into a tangible product that your potential customers can use. Getting from inception of an idea all the way to shipping it seems like a pretty straight forward process, but so is war- get guns, tanks, draw a strategy, invade, and take over. When you get caught up in the heat of a battle, I’m sure what seemed simple on the surface, isn’t so simple after all. Gunfire has a way of doing that. Shipping a product that customers want is kind of the same thing. The gunfire of confusion, resisting feature creep, and not having a defined process can make taking an idea from inception to shipping it terribly difficult. I was guilty of this with my first startup, Publictivity. <strong> Never ever again. </strong> I often get asked about the topic, so here’s the exact blueprint I follow. This is how I go about taking a product from inception all the way to shipping it as well as having paying customers lined up. I will use examples from two products I’m currently working on <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> (shipped, profitable, 100+ customers, and version two on its way) and <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'Cloudomatic(flow) ']);">Cloudomatic(flow) </a> (early alpha testing, shipping soon for mass consumption, 150+ customers lined up for launch).</p>
<h2>Step 1: Define The Problem</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with ideas is the fact that they don’t really solve a problem. All too often entrepreneurs go about creating cool things that don’t solve a real problem. By defining the problem, it helps you clarify what you’re building and why. Defining the problem gives you constraints around feature creep. It lets you say “Does this feature or functionality add anything that is core to solving the problem?” You would be surprised how many features make it into products that have absolutely nothing to do with solving the problem.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> I just bought my iPad, started blogging more heavily, and wanted to make sure my blog was optimized for the tablet format. I certainly wasn’t going to make a native iPad app. At first I thought I would just modify my existing theme by removing dropdowns, increasing the size of the font,etc. Well yeah, that did not work out too well. <strong> Problem: No easy way for publishers to make their content Tablet friendly using their existing CMS (in my case WordPress). </strong></p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> We created Cloudomatic.com in a weekend. Revenue model was simple: drive traffic, integrate affiliate links, make a very nice commission as SaaS has a very nice ARPU. It turns out that very few SaaS developers had an affiliate program. As former SaaS guys ourselves, we looked around and understood why: existing stuff was too complex, didn’t work with subscription services, and devs were too busy to build it themselves. <strong> Problem: No easy way for web app developers to get setup with a simple affiliate program in under an hour. </strong></p>
<h2>Step 2: High Level Overview Specifications and Mockups</h2>
<p>At this point you probably know what you want to build and specifically what problem the app is meant to solve. From here you start to define the solution to the problem stated above. How will the app specifically solve this problem? What is the secret sauce? The high level specifications should be 1-2 pages at MOST. This is something that a normal human being should be able to read and define specific important features. It’s really the skeleton for the technical outline of your app. In short, it should be enough for photoshop mockups or even just wireframes created with Balsamiq.</p>
<p>When creating mockups and wireframes don’t focus on fleshing out every last detail or every last little screen ie- the reset password screen or some obscure settings page. Instead, pick maybe 4-5 different screens that show the key functionality of the app. You’re prepping yourself for initial customer feedback and validation, so pick the screens that are going to convince them and get the point across that your solution is solving the problem you have defined.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a>, I spent a fair amount of time looking at the native iPad applications major publishers had put out such as USA Today, BBC, Financial Times,etc. I also had a list of specific functionality that I knew was crucial. Simple page design, large fonts, accelerometer aware, touch navigation, swiping to advance were some of them. I also defined the way that integration should work with WordPress. This was more of a technical issue, but it was also key to adoption. For mockups I basically screenshotted from my iPad, photoshopped a bunch of different things together, and also took videos of the touch interactions that were key.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> With <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> we basically locked ourselves down for an entire weekend to get through steps 1-3. I defined everything that was needed from the both the developer standpoint and the affiliate end. From there we translated that into the 4 most important separate screens that had an overview of what the app would do- overview dashboard, define payment plans coordinated with your app, and what the interface looks like for an actual affiliate.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Initial Customer Feedback and Validation</h2>
<p>This is a really crucial step and it might be a really depressing or exciting step. At this point you now have something that you can show potential customers to have them say: “This is interesting, I would use it and/or would pay you for it.” You should probably synthesize the simple specs into some type of sales literature or at least something a normal person can read. The mockups should be fine as is. If you’re using wireframes, just explain that this is for feedback purposes only and a very rough idea of what is being built.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept things really rough and also took a risk by playing things close to the chest. We basically explained what the app would do in simple terms: Take your existing WordPress install, if a user accesses your blog from their iPad web browser, it behaves like a native iPad app. We highlighted major features that drove this point home and showed what were some God awful mockups. They were frankshops of many different apps we thought made sense, but it got the point across. Enough bloggers told us this would be useful and that they would pay for it. So we soldiered on.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', ' Cloudomatic(flow) ']);"> Cloudomatic(flow) </a> was an interesting beast from this perspective. It went way better than we thought it would. This was a very public customer feedback/validation phase using what’s called an MVP smoke test ie- the product isn’t fully built, but gauge consumer feedback as if it is there. The goal was to see if we would get sign-ups, but we also indicated in the confirmation email that if you wanted to be fast tracked into the beta that you could email us indicating so. This let us do a few things a) see how badly some people wanted the product b) have some initial individuals we could reach out to in order to make sure we were building the most critical features first c) set priorities for sending out actual invites when the time came. The site at <a href="http://flow.cloudomatic.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://flow.cloudomatic.com', 'flow.cloudomatic.com ']);">flow.cloudomatic.com </a>is the same exact site, screenshots,etc. that we used for this phase if you want to see what was actually there.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Be An Axe Murderer</h2>
<p>Guess what? You’re probably doing too much even with the simple initial spec and mockups that you put together. Besides validating the problem and your specific solution, talking to potential customers allows you to find out which features are really crucial and which ones are nice to have. Start killing off things you don’t need right away and leave them to Version 1.1,etc., but also make sure the really important ones have a very high priority. By doing this, your app will be left to the most core and essential features. This will make it easier to get the product in the hands of your customers AND it will also make you laser focused on the things that truly matter to your customers.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> With <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed ']);"> PadPressed </a> we kept the features that stuck with the core vision of making the app feel native as opposed to adding things that would have been publisher/blogging specific. We don’t have comments right now and probably won’t until we can do them right to integrate with the experience. We could have easily just included the comment div, but it wasn’t worth keeping a half assed feature.</p>
<p><strong> Example 2: </strong> Cloudomatic(flow) is really really simple. We reduced it down to a few API calls and a Javascript embed. There are a lot of features we’ll add in the future for conversions, advanced affiliate management, reseller management,etc. We basically only went with features that focused on the core problem at hand: a) Specifically working with recurring subscriptions for SaaS b) Making integration take less than an hour for SaaS developers by reducing things to a few simple API calls. We also reduced the payout options from every provider under the sun to the most requested one: PayPal</p>
<h2>Step 5: Detailed Specifications</h2>
<p>Detailed specs are like your blueprint for the app, and shouldn’t be rushed. You can’t think of every scenario until you start building + testing it, but you can certainly try. When you’re working with a multiperson team, you don’t have time to wait for email responses, second guess, or hold things up. If it’s in the specs, you know where to go. It also helps keep scope creep away. My specs also include the database structure and design as well.</p>
<p><strong> Example 1: </strong> <a href="http://www.padpressed.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.PadPressed.com', ' PadPressed’s ']);"> …</a></p></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>At some point we had an issue with application startup performance.
For a bit of context this app runs in a Kubernetes cluster, with k8s it’s possible
to define a <em>rollout policy</em> to avoid service distruption, that what we had, so there’s a
rollout, new pods (a pod is composed of the application container) get created,
new application are started, then Kubernetes has a mean to check when the application is
<strong>ready</strong>, it’s called the readyness probe. This probe can be a call to http endpoint or a script,
ours is an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>WHen the probe indicates the application is ready, the application starts receiving traffic,
from this moment latencies increased from 10-20 milliseconds to seconds.</p>
<p>Opening the recording JMC, it will start an automated analysis. Sometime it’s helpful
and warning should be looked at. In this case the issue was elsewhere.</p>
<p>To help in our case, we need to go in the thread view, which as a <em>thread lanes</em>
which displays each thread as an horizontal bar, and JFR event are painted on the bar
at the time they happened and for how long. At the bottom there’s a the time axis.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 0 thread lanes">
</p>
<p>Thread Lanes</p>
</div>
<p>The first things that catch our eyes will be the vertical patterns, especially the one with
yellow and red around 12:51:15. Let’s zoom (you can select and right click, or use arrow keys.).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-0-threads-lanes-closer.png" alt="startup 0 threads lanes closer">
</p>
<p>Zooming on the problematic</p>
</div>
<p>The vertical pattern is more precise, these vertical pattern indicates a <em>cross
threads phenomena</em>. And we can notice that all thread are not affected the same way.</p>
<p>The lanes in green at the top indicates these threads are progressing normally, nothing’s
wrong with them. However is we go down there especially, the pattern materialize around
12:51:11.</p>
<p>Each color indicate some events</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gray ⇒ the thread does nothing, it’s parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small dark point ⇒ The park event, the thread was scheduled but was eventually parked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red ⇒ In this case it’s a <em>blocked lock</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yellow ⇒ Here the yellow events that intrests us are thread waiting on a lock</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I’m not well versed in desfribing colors, so know that there are other events that use
a slightly different tone / shade of red, yellow or else. Just click on the event
to see what’s going on.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-lock-event.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis lock event">
</p>
<p>monitor blocked</p>
</div>
<p>The UI could be improved but going over the events shows a popup with it’s details,
for the Monitor Blocked event, there’s the duration this monitor was block, who held
this monitor before, and the monitor address in the heap.</p>
<p>This monitor was held for ~9s, that’s a big bottleneck !</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-acquire-blocked.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor acquire blocked">
</p>
</div>
<p>In this case we had ~200 thread competing for this lock in particular. And finding the thread that
acquired it is not automated, it’s a bit tedious, but in the end didn’t revealed anything.</p>
<p>However the Monitor Blocked event has another interesting element, the stacktrace. In the lower
pane of JMC, if the event is selected, we can see the stack trace where this event was emmitted.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-threads-jedis-monitor-blocked-stack.png" alt="startup 1 threads jedis monitor blocked stack">
</p>
<p>jedis classloading</p>
</div>
<p>Here that’s the JDK classloader. I would never have thought that the JDK code would cause ~9s
contention. But looking at the stacktrace, there <em>jedis</em> (a Redis client) connection pool involved.
Maybe the class have static initialization that does IO, maybe it’s the agent that runs in production
that introduces latencies during this specific classlaoding.</p>
<p>But all the threads starts working again around 12:51:22, and redis bottle neck is not anymore an issue
afterward. Let’s look at the story on the IO side, open the Socket IO view.</p>
<p>Identify which one is related to redis, either via IP or via port (Redis is <code>6379</code>).</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis-port.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis port">
</p>
<p>Socket IO with redis port selected</p>
</div>
<p>While we see a total time of 30s, it’s the accumulated time for all thread for the recording duration (6m).
So nothing fancy here. However we see that actual IO happens really late, around 12:51:22.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-1-socketio-redis.png" alt="startup 1 socketio redis">
</p>
<p>Socket IO actual Redis read / write</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure of the cause, we can definitely rule out Redis, the is either in the network, during
connection establishment, or actually during classloading.</p>
<p>In order to remediate that, we noticed this code is called once the application is ready.
So in order to avoid the contention the code was changed to pre-connect to redis during the
application startup before the the application is considedred ready. And it worked, this
specific issue disappeared.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-2-thread-lanes.png" alt="startup 2 thread lanes">
</p>
</div>
<p>However as knew from the first recording, and now the second iteration this was not the only issue
identified when flying over the yellow and red events.</p>

<p>All the stacktraces above have one thing in common, a contention on a lock.
As thread were blocked, and new request appeared, this had the effects of increase the
queuing, and made tomcat creates new <em>http nio</em> worked threads until the maximum is reached
(200 by default). I applied the same trick: i.e before readyness, exercise code paths that
are lazy initialized. And it worked too. Most contention disappeared afterward.</p>

</p>
<p>Better startup / C2 compiler event</p>
</div>
<p>There was still some potential gain however. We noticed a few C2 compiler events,
If you don’t know C1 and C2, it’s the compilers that transform bytecode to assembly.
While C1 is somewhat superficial in optimizing the assembly, but it requires few
CPU and it allows code to be executed asap yet not as efficient as possible. In a
second phase C2 may kick in, this one outputs highly optimized code for hot code path
(code that is executed very, very often), but it requires resources.</p>
<p>Note this compilation event is not blocking threads !</p>
<p>As an experiment I decided to use the Graal compiler, which I believe is the new
generation of compiler. <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/compiler/README.md">Graal compiler</a>
is part of the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal">GraalVM</a> project.
It ships as an experimental option : <code>-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseJVMCICompiler</code>.</p>
<p>And the result for this work load in particular.</p>

<p>This graph is falling under the <a href="https://latencytipoftheday.blogspot.com/2014/06/latencytipoftheday-most-page-loads.html"><em>percentlie</em></a>
but the improvement is still visible.</p>
<p>Now when we analyzed the new profile we noticed that JVM was using a lot of time to
revoke bias locking. Note the events in fushia are custom JFR events that track HTTP requests.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling">Gunnar Morling</a> has an inspiring
<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">write up</a> about it).</p>
<p>This VM operation is done during safepoint during which the JVM is paused. At this time a lot of
of bias revocation event appears, so we removed them, and it works too.</p>

</p>
<p>Revoke Bias locking</p>
</div>
<p>The graphic below shows the difference in startup time. Other consuming backend services had to timeout
and eventually perform retries during rollouts which increased the pressure on the application.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-5-before-after.png" alt="startup 5 before after">
</p>
<p>Before ⇒ after</p>
</div>
<p>Other smaller issues could be discovered and tackled, for example I noticed a few gaps
200ms wide at 30/1min intervals that were related to GC pauses.</p>
<div>
<p>GC gaps</p>
<p><span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-1.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 1" title="GC gap 1"></span> <span><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-gc-pause-2.png" alt="startup 9 gc pause 2" title="GC gap 2"></span></p>
</div>
<p>For this application the GC is working within 20ms excepts for a few larger pauses
during the early minutes of startup:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://blog.arkey.fr/assets/jfr/startup-9-thread-lanes-gc-pauses-effect.png" alt="startup 9 thread lanes gc pauses effect">
</p>
<p>GC pauses causes new HTTP worker threads</p>
</div>
<p>Tuning GC is out of scope for this article, but JMC presents a nice view that could help identify GC
causes. In my opinion it’s currently a bit less powerful as GC logs because GC events lack
useful information only found in GC logs with appropriate tags and level.</p>

</div>
<p>Anyway from there we could imagine a <em>setting</em> file in the JDK dedicated for GC events.
Instead of parsing log files whose <em>string format</em> that may change a bit over releases
(even with unified logging) GC events could be analyzed leveraging the included JFR schema.</p>
<p>Also with JFR, it’s even possible to record memory leak using the <code>profile</code> <em>settings</em> file,
I never tried that in a real situation though, but if this avoids the need to make a heap dump
and parse it then I’m all in.</p>

The consequences of our testing the limits of our natural habitat are playing out today, poised to speed up and multiply.</p><p>The impacts of a warming world, today, are accelerating, compounding, and exacerbating.&nbsp;</p><p>Season after season, the societal toll of climate change is precipitated by climate-related natural disasters. The frequency and variability of these events are outstripping our ability to mitigate its source -- greenhouse gas emissions -- and our ability to adapt to the heightened risk.</p><h4><strong>Accounting for the Damage</strong></h4><p>Climate change is here, now. Natural disasters around the world <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-disasters/forest-fire-insurance-costs-soar-idUKKCN1P2129"><span>caused</span></a> $160 billion in economic damages in 2018. Devastating storms in the Gulf of the U.S. or the coast of Japan have led to lives lost and economic destruction of <a href="http://www.cityam.com/271984/natural-catastrophes-led-more-than-half-trillion-pounds"><span>upward of</span></a> $650 billion over two years. Global human displacement is seeing new highs in the Asia Pacific region, with <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/factbox-asia-pacific-worlds-most-disaster-prone-region">60 million people displaced</a> from 2013 and 2015 alone. This is an area where nearly a billion people are <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/2015_Year%20in%20Review_final_PDF_1.pdf"><span>expected</span></a> to live by 2030.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595759604616_6108"><div><h4><strong>Fuel to the Fire</strong></h4><p>The U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/"><span>called</span></a> climate change a “threat multiplier.” There are no countries immune to its effects. No clearer was this exemplified than during the Syrian Civil War in 2011. A series of droughts in the region <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629816301822"><span>led to</span></a> large scale migration of young men to the country’s cities. The socio-economic stresses already present were exacerbated by the influx. Less rainfall and prolonged drought in East Africa causing further entrenched conflicts over natural resources is also representative of how anthropogenic climate change is fueling the fire of conflict.</p><p>A study by the Pentagon last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-18/in-dire-report-pentagon-warns-bases-imperiled-by-climate-change"><span>warned</span></a> of the link between climate change, war, and migration -- confirming that global temperature rise has and will fuel conflict and refugees. A few months later, Rod Schoonover, a member of the White House National Security Council, spoke to the Senate in June 2019, and explained:</p><p>“No country will be immune to the effect of climate change over the next 20 years, but some will be able to cope, adapt, or respond more effectively than others. […] Local problems could spillover with global consequences, such as through increased human displacement, natural resource disputes, commodity price volatility” […] “Climate change effects could undermine important international systems on which the U.S. and its partners are critically dependent, such as trade routes, food and energy supplies, the global economy, and domestic stability abroad.”</p><h4><strong>Risks to Come</strong></h4><p>There are also other risks that have only begun to be accounted for. Those that are often unforeseen but inescapable in an interconnected world.</p><p>For one, the management of corporate supply chains in an accelerating transition to renewable energy and disruptive changes to consumer habits will lead to economic collisions. It is not only the impact of destabilizing production sources in geographies vulnerable to physical climate disruptions. The prices of goods will also need to be stabilized in the open market as the financial industry, like pension funds, shift capital to ESG-pegged investments.</p><p>As an example, Coca Cola saw its balance sheets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/24/science/earth/threat-to-bottom-line-spurs-action-on-climate.html?ref=business"><span>endangered by droughts</span></a> that reduced water availability needed to produce its soda, a risk they recognize will magnify. Nike has also sounded the alarm in its supply chain management due to the increase of tropical storms hitting its factories that mostly reside in Southeast Asia. Four Nike factories in Thailand had to shut down in 2008 due to floods.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595762628047_9013"><div><h4><strong>Canary in the Coal Mine</strong></h4><p>The thawing of permafrost and retreating sea ice in the Arctic has been said to be the “canary in the coal mine” of the climate crisis.

        <p><em>(This post was originally written as a reply on the mailop mailing-list, but
a friend asked me to turn it into a blog post.  I've edited it, mostly
adding more links to elsewhere, but there are some additions here.)</em></p>
<p><em>Context: someone with a mail-server hosted in a German facility with a
poor reputation for handling abuse reports was asking for help on
sending email to their Gmail-using friends; they had SPF and didn't see
the point of DKIM; they had TLS setup for their mail-server, using a
certificate from CACert.</em></p>
<p>There's a PDF from Google from 2006 which is still worth reading:
<a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf">https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/45.pdf</a>, entitled
“Sender Reputation in a Large Webmail Service” by Bradley Taylor.
Anyone running a mail-server today needs to read that document.</p>
<p>If you don't send much email, then the only IP-based reputation which
Google can assess you on is the reputation of your address-block, so
being in a “troublesome” hosting provider will score heavily against
you.  At that point, if not moving away, you need to try to balance out
that negative score with enough positives that any of the large
providers using reputation scoring will accept the mail.</p>
<p>Working forward-and-reverse paired DNS is even more important for IPv6
than for IPv4; for better or worse, some of the large providers have
decided that exemptions in old standards for old behavior should not
apply when folks deploy standards which are far newer.  So you
absolutely need an <code>MX</code> record, you must not just rely upon
address-records (<code>A</code> and <code>AAAA</code>).</p>
<p>With a poor IP-based reputation, you need to see if you can score a
better domain-based reputation.  This is where DKIM comes into play:
once you can provably link a message to really be from a given domain,
then even if you don't send much mail you can benefit from stuff like
“not on day-old-bread domain-lists”.  But having DKIM and then a DMARC
record does help (and <a href="https://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2014/04/dmarc-stance/">I'm no fan of DMARC</a>).</p>
<p>For the mail-server's TLS: for that to count in your favor instead of
being a wash, I strongly suspect that it needs to be a certificate which
senders can verify.  For those people scoring up for “better TLS”, those
senders using DANE will be happy with a TLSA record in DNSSEC for your
CACert anchor.  But the large webmail providers are Resistant to having
to deploy DNSSEC verification, so instead have pushed out an alternative
called MTA-STS.  With MTA-STS, you're tied into “whichever subset of CAs
all the large senders you care about will trust”, and then using that CA
for the certificates both for the MTA-STS web-server and for your
mail-server.  Note that you don't need to implement the client logic for
MTA-STS (and I think it's antithetical to an open federated platform)
but do need to just publish the static information for those senders who
do use it. At that point, CACert is not going to cut it.  You'd need to
try Let's Encrypt instead.</p>
<p>The ongoing natural tendency from larger providers is to favor
supporting what the majority of their users want the majority of the
time.  With so many people using larger providers, they naturally tilt
towards stuff which works with the larger senders, and requiring more
hoops.  Those additional hoops create more work for smaller providers
and self-hosters doing thing manually.</p>
<p>We need better automation tools around all of this.  The below will make
it clearer why.</p>
<p>So, here is my current understanding of the best current practices here,
in reality not IETF idealism.  This includes making mandatory stuff
which some folks insist must be optional, because realistically to send
to some large providers it's not optional.  This list includes features
to make you compatible with ongoing trends in the EU (particularly
Germany) to strongly disfavor allowing clear-text SMTP.</p>
<p>This assumes that you are <em>not</em> a large sender who should also be
setting up feedback loops, learning how to “warm” IPs, considering BIMI,
postmaster tooling domain verification, etc.</p>
<h3 id="deliverability-fixes">Deliverability fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>reverse DNS with matching forward DNS; the name used should not
pattern-match anything generic and ideally would include a DNS label
of <code>mail</code> or <code>mx</code> or the like in it.</li>
<li>MX record, always.</li>
<li>Accurate SPF;
<ul>
<li>ideally not too broad; pay attention to SPF's query limits.</li>
<li>avoid <code>-all</code> at the end because, with the sole exception of “this
domain never sends email” records, the larger operators have metrics to
show that using <code>-all</code> <em>tends</em> to be a sign of over-enthusiasm rather
than reality, so it will slightly count against you;</li>
<li>remember to have an SPF record for your <code>HELO</code> hostname, because
when you send a “bounce” rejection, this is the thing which will be
looked up (since there's no domain in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DKIM set up, with thought towards the selector namespace.
<ul>
<li>RSA2048 key is effectively a hard-requirement
<ul>
<li>DNS TXT records consist of one or more DNS strings, each of which
is limited to 255 ASCII characters.  For a key of this size, you
will end up needing two DNS strings in the zonefile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ed25519 keys are not yet widely supported, but by now are not
likely to actively break and make things worse for you, if you
dual-sign.  This needs to be a different selector.</li>
<li>Note that for various good reasons you should design this to be
something you routinely rotate.
<ul>
<li>Some folks use yearly, some monthly</li>
<li>I rotate every three months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DMARC record; see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489" title="Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)">RFC 7489</a>
<ul>
<li>But for domains which humans send from <em>don't</em> use
<code>p=quarantine</code> or <code>p=reject</code>;</li>
<li>Do consider setting up a receiver for reports, just so that you can
see how much of a privacy breach DMARC reporting is when you send
to mailing-lists which don't re-sign. :-/</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLS certificate from a CA in the main trust anchor bundles;
<ul>
<li>Just use Let's Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MTA-STS web-server with HTTPS certificate from the same CA, and the
relevant MTA-STS txt file in place; add the DNS record when it's up
and happy.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461" title="SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)">RFC 8461</a>.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/">https://esmtp.email/tools/mta-sts/</a> for a testing validation tool
(with thanks to Luis Muñoz for the pointer).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the independent mail providers using the stuff broadly supported
in open source MTAs, you should look at DNSSEC, because the patterns
here are less susceptible to rent-seeking pressures:
<ul>
<li>DNSSEC-signed zone for your own domain
<ul>
<li>Use whichever signing algorithm CloudFlare are currently using:
this should be both current for cryptography and widely enough
supported that if it's not supported by someone's resolver, then
they have bigger problems than just your domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNSSEC validating resolver for you to look up records of others
(consider <a href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/">Unbound</a> or <a href="https://www.knot-resolver.cz/">Knot Resolver</a>)</li>
<li>DANE records for your own domain (TLSA records in DNS)
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7672" title="SMTP Security via Opportunistic DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS)">RFC 7672</a> for the SMTP details.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA">RFC 6698</a> for the base spec with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7218" title="Adding Acronyms to Simplify Conversations about DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)">RFC 7218</a> for some common
acronyms which make talking about it easier.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7671" title="The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Protocol: Updates and Operational Guidance">RFC 7671</a> for the updates and operational guidance.</li>
<li>There are other RFCs, for SRV records and for OpenPGP, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tell your mail-server to obey DANE stuff, so that if there's a TLSA
record in DNSSEC-verified DNS then the mail-server can disable
fallback to cleartext for delivery to MX (and ideally also then
verify the TLS connection has a cert chain which is anchored in one
of the TLSA records)</li>
<li><a href="https://dnsviz.net/">https://dnsviz.net</a> is your friend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>_smtp._tls</code> record so you can get reports of TLS failures sending to
you</li>
<li>Seeing if you can get your IP onto one of the open DNS-based
allow-lists (also called “whitelists” but some folks are moving away
from that term), such as <a href="https://www.dnswl.org/">https://www.dnswl.org/</a> or Spamhaus's SWL.</li>
<li>Periodically check if you appear in any DNS-based deny-lists.</li>
<li>Make sure you're not sending from “ISP residential address-space”; if
need be route your mail outbound via a host in better address-space
(and update SPF etc to match)</li>
<li>Don't do sender call-out verification to SMTP servers which aren't
yours.</li>
<li>For your own sanity, do make sure you set up <a href="https://www.fail2ban.org/">fail2ban</a>, or something
like it, scanning your mail-server logs, because SMTP AUTH online
cracking is widespread.  If they ever get in, your deliverability
will be negatively impacted by their spam campaign through your
mail-server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="convenience-stuff">Convenience Stuff</h3>
<p>Outside of “Phil's BCP” above, additional non-deliverability but
convenience options include:</p>
<ol>
<li>DNS SRV records for submission(s)/imap(s)/pop3(s)/sieve, even if just
to say with «<code>0 0 0 .</code>» that it's not supported.</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using OpenPGP with email,
then set up WKD to publish OpenPGP keys for your domain too.
<ul>
<li>This is just a fixed schema for laying out keys for HTTPS retrieval.</li>
<li>See the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service/?include_text=1" title="OpenPGP Web Key Directory">WKD draft</a> for details.</li>
<li>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control">https://github.com/PennockTech/openpgpkey-control</a> as a
management framework for an organization; the
<code>other/standalone-update-website</code> script is designed to be
embeddable into an existing site-building workflow without anything
else from the repository.</li>
<li>The GnuPG project has tooling available which manages the WKD layout as
an email-integrated workflow, for people to update their own keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your communications base includes people using S/MIME then set up
SMIMEA records in your DNSSEC-signed DNS.
<ul>
<li>They look a lot like TLSA records; both are trust anchors in DNS.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8162" title="Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names for S/MIME">RFC 8162</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The moment you start specifying “must be TLS-secured” it's worth
adding <code>CAA</code> records into DNS, so that Certificate Authorities which
are broadly trusted will refuse to issue for your domain unless you
list them.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8659" title="DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record">RFC 8659</a> for details</li>
<li>The values checked by each Certificate Authority as indicating they
have permission are required to be listed in their Certification
Practice Statement, as part of the CA/Browser forum's Baseline
Requirements.  If it's missing, then browsers are not supposed to
be trusting that CA.</li>
<li>For domain-validation CAs such as Let's Encrypt, consider adding
account information to those records to tie it to your specific
account.  See <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8657" title="Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding">RFC 8657</a> for details.</li>
<li>Beware that at time of writing, Let's Encrypt only honors the
<code>accounturi</code> restriction in their staging environment, not their
production setup; this will likely change.</li>
<li>Remember that DNS zonefiles support comments.  You'll want them</li></ul></li></ol></article></main></div></div>

Earlier we had <a href="https://androidrookies.com/telegram-developer-wants-a-law-to-make-apple-allow-iphone-users-to-install-apps-from-other-app-stores/">Pavel Durov of Telegram</a> who wanted legislation enacted to make Apple allow iPhone to install independent Apps stores. Now, Epic Games CEO, Tim Sweeney has joined the crowd.</p><p>Sweeney castigated both Apple and Google for their monopolistic App store policies. Both Apple and Google charge a 30% commission from developers offering paid/premium or in-App services. Sweeney says that both the tech giants have<span> built app stores that are entirely based on the idea of monopoly.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Sweeney called Apple an <strong>absolute monopoly</strong>.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/24/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-apple-crippled-app-store-with-30percent-cut.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, Sweeney says Apple has invented “an absolute monopoly,” while Google crushes competition stores with “UI barriers.” He says that the 30% fee charged by both Apple and Google are unrealistic and emphasized that these charges only&nbsp;increase the price of the apps and games.</p><p>Epic Games has a bad history with App stores, especially with Google Play Store. It had earlier Fortnite for Android smartphone as an APK to beat Google’s 30% commission fees. However, when Fortnite players complained that installing the APK was too complicated, Epic Games relented and published it on <a title="Google Play" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicgames.fortnite&amp;hl=en_IN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> paying Google the 30% commission as mandated.</p><p>“Google essentially intentionally stifles competing stores by having user interface barriers and obstruction. If every developer could accept their own payments and avoid the 30% tax by Apple and Google we could pass the savings along to all our consumers and players would get a better deal on items. And you’d have economic competition,” Sweeney told CNBC.</p><p>He was also very fierce on Apple. “Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software,” Sweeney told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin.</p><p>This is not the first time Sweeney has lashed out against Google. In <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/12/tim-sweeney-android-is-a-fake-open-system-and-ios-is-worse/">February 2020</a> during a keynote address to the DICE Summit game event in Las Vegas, he had called Google’s Android a “fake open system” for putting up barriers in front of users.</p><p>The representatives of tech giants, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, will be testifying in a <a href="https://androidrookies.com/jeff-bezos-tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-sunder-pichai-to-testify-in-u-s-antitrust-hearing-on-july-27/">Congress hearing</a> for their anti-trust behavior. <a href="https://androidrookies.com/microsoft-complains-about-apples-30-commission-from-app-developers-during-private-anti-trust-meeting/">Brad Smith, President and Legal Officer of Microsoft</a> has already had a private meeting with the anti-trust committee members in which he complained about Apple’s App store commission.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p>If you try to deploy a new release of Clojure library with
<a href="https://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>, it prompts you to sign the .jar file with GPG. This step
often causes confusion and breaks. I believe that it’s not worth the effort to
make it work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>nobody ever verifies the signatures</em> in a systematic way.
There are a bunch of obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unclear if any tools for verifying the signatures actually work. For
example, I just tried to run <code>lein deps :verify</code> against a couple of projects
and it reported every dependency as <code>:unsigned</code>. I know that some of those
dependencies are signed and I verified that the <code>.asc</code> files exist on
repo.clojars.org.</li>
<li>It’s hard to find the public keys for the library maintainers. Sometimes they
upload them on the keyservers, sometimes not.</li>
<li>There’s no established way of communicating that which public keys should be
trusted. If there’s a new release and it has been made with a new key, your
best bet is to e-mail the maintainer and ask what is up.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to get any security benefits from the signatures in practice. Thus
it’s okay to set <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/998d373ae06d17234efffde761fae93242c736fa/sample.project.clj#L111"><code>:sign-releases</code></a> to <code>false</code> in your
project.clj even if Leiningen’s manual does not recommend it.</p>
<hr>
<p>In princple, the systematic checking of signatures could provide security
against a dangerous supply-chain attack: weak or leaked passwords for package
manager accounts. For example, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/">several RubyGems</a> have been attacked
this way. Most likely the signing keys would not be compromised at the same
time.</p>
<p>There are alternative solutions, though, such as disallowing publishing packages
without multi-factor authentication. Using Clojars’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/GmAU4XwnRpw">deploy tokens</a>
helps a bit as well.</p>
<p>Right now we place a lot of trust on Clojars and Maven Central. If either of
them got compromised, we all would be screwed. Package signing could be a part
of a solution to mitigate that risk, but a comprehensive solution would be
something like using <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">The Update Framework</a>. Go’s <a href="https://blog.golang.org/module-mirror-launch">checksum
database</a> is also worth taking look at.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re moved to do something about this, please do not build
anything new using PGP. To quote Latacora: <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">PGP is bad and needs to go
away</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve written this post in part to be proven wrong. I’m eagerly waiting for posts
from y’all about how you do, in fact, systematically verify the signatures.</p>

                    <p>As COVID-19 continues to alter the way we live, there is a scramble to predict what our “new normal” will look like. After the virus fades away or, God help us, becomes a constant in our day-to-day life for years to come, which change brought on by the pandemic will stick? </p><p>There is one consensus prediction that is emerging, especially among knowledge workers and those in tech: The distributed workforce is here to stay. And, furthermore, this change is a good thing for workers and welcomed by all.</p><p>To which I say: Um, have you ever worked remotely?</p><p>I have understood and enjoyed the perks of working remotely before. From 2009 to 2016 I wrote about entrepreneurs and creatives, many of whom were early proponents of remote work. And from 2017 to 2019, I worked remotely for a small, privately-owned e-learning company and then a 1000-employee SaaS company. </p><p>While the upsides to remote work are true, for many people remote work is a poison pill — one where you are given “control” in the name of productivity in exchange for some pretty nasty long-term effects.</p><p><strong>In reality, remote work makes you vulnerable to outsourcing, reduces your job to a metric, creates frustrating change-averse bureaucracies, and stifles your career growth.</strong> The lack of scrutiny our remote future faces is going to result in frustrated workers and ineffective companies.</p><p>Let’s tackle these issues one at a time. </p><h2 id="remote-work-democratizes-talent-for-everyone-even-you-">Remote work “democratizes talent” for everyone. Even you.</h2><p>In May 2020, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/manjunath-bhat/2020/05/03/remote-work-is-the-next-big-equalizer/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">a Gartner blog post</a> summarized a common argument in favor of remote work: “Democratizing access to resources lowers the barriers to innovation and enables everybody to partake in the ensuing prosperity.” Not everyone can (or wants to) live in an urban commercial hub. Remote work, the thinking goes, allows people to live in whatever environment they’d like — depending on their own circumstances.</p><p>These remote technology jobs don’t just go to a version of you living on a cute farm in the Hudson Valley. Those jobs go to <em>anyone, anywhere.</em> </p><p>This is good for global prosperity and perhaps arguably inevitable. However, if you’re working in technology today as an American, you have tremendous earning potential. This earning potential may not be possible forever. It’s baffling to me that American workers would cheer an acceleration of this trend that would place downward pressure on their wages.</p><p>When you, the American worker, share this belief you are being blinded by an erroneous belief in American exceptionalism. When your company goes all-remote, it is starting a clock that ends in you eventually competing with the global talent market — especially if travel and visas continue to be restricted by the federal government.</p><p>A tech optimist will likely (and correctly) point out that more innovation and new technologies will replace any outsourced jobs. While my academic brain wants that to be true, I can’t help but see the devastating effects globalization had to our manufacturing workers and communities — many of which have never recovered or benefited from new innovations.</p><p>Innovation in the American economy didn’t get transferred one-to-one. Every manufacturing worker did not suddenly receive a tech job. Every technology worker outsourced will not receive the benefit of the next wave of innovation directly. </p><h2 id="remote-enables-you-to-be-forgotten">Remote enables you to be forgotten</h2><p>Remote work advocates often praise the focus that remote work enables. No longer will you be judged by the time you spend at the office, they say, you’ll instead be judged and rewarded on whether you “get things done.” </p><p>These “benefits” are always used to sell remote work to an imagined audience of Dilbert-like cubicle dwellers who are imprisoned and subjected by annoying coworkers and an oppressive boss. The key to freedom, they say, is to work remotely. Basecamp co-founder Jason Fried <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">writes in <em>Remote</em></a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Working%20From%20Home%20Boosts%20The%20Quality%20Of%20The%20Work" data-author="Jason Fried&nbsp;" cite="https://www.inc.com/jason-fried/excerpt-remote-workers-boost-quality.html">
                      <p>What you're left with is "what did this person actually do today?" Not "when did they get in?" or "how late did they stay?" Instead it's all about the work produced. So instead of asking a remote worker "what did you do today?" you can now just say, "Show me what you did today." As a manager, you can directly evaluate the work--the thing you're paying this person for--and ignore all the stuff that doesn't actually matter.</p>
                      
                      </blockquote>
                      <!--kg-card-end: html--><p>First, being more productive isn’t the only goal of working, but let’s put that to the side. Second, Fried is right, you do gain a bit of freedom from your boss (which doubles as a loss of a mentor, but we’ll get to that). You also gain “freedom” from your colleagues and collaborators. Which means you’re effectively on your own. </p><p>This is empowering to some, but the isolation can mean your contributions are easily overlooked or misunderstood. As a result, I’ve noticed a disturbing trend at (especially larger) remote companies: Some managers often have no clue what their direct reports are doing and how they are doing it. </p><p>Performance reviews are difficult enough under normal circumstances. But how do you judge someone when you can only see their output and never their process? Marketers, project managers, product managers, growth marketers, and others spend their days supporting or maintaining existing things. &nbsp;</p><p>This a difficult problem that predates any shift to remote work. But when applied to remote work, a manager loses several of the inputs needed to judge a direct report’s output — including, yes, who is physically (and mentally) present when actual work is being done. But also: Do the other team members appear to enjoy working with this person? And, if they are struggling, is it due to a lack of effort/focus or something outside of their control? </p><p>Employees who “do the right thing” spending extra time and energy supporting their teammates receive absolutely no recognition for doing the little things needed for a smooth-running, collaborative organization. It’s usually a quantifiable fact whether a sales departments reaches their goals. It’s not as clear that the social media manager had a good quarter.</p><p>With the removed context of a real-life office, your team’s output is difficult to individualize for your manager — especially if work is done in private DMs or one-on-one Zoom calls. The manager sees the end product with no visibility as to who did what, who pulled their weight, who made tough choices, and who made things more difficult. This has a nasty side effect of the leader viewing you less as a person who they have to empathize with and understand — and more as a talking head on a Zoom call or Slack who does things for them. </p><p>This will cause your work to “flatten.” Whatever soft skills you bring to the table will be minimized when working remotely. This will lead to companies and processes relying less on things like creativity and collaboration and more on simple inputs and outputs. Which, again, makes your work easier to outsource.</p><p>We bemoan the loss of empathy and context created by solely getting our news and interacting via social media … and we then turn around and set up our working lives in their image.</p><p>This has a pronounced effect in large organizations.</p><h2 id="remote-work-breaks-large-companies">Remote work breaks large companies</h2><p>Remote work supporters often return to the “interruption culture” at an IRL office as an argument for distributed work. First, clearly people that believe remote work creates an interruption-free zone have never used Slack or email. Second, those interruptions often exist for a reason: They often communicate information that ensures everyone is working on the right thing.</p><p>For companies that have strong product/market fit, have reached scale, and have a clear product roadmap, remote works swimmingly. A distraction-free environment means everyone can focus on “what matters” because “what matters” has been clear and consistent. &nbsp;</p><p>But what happens when “what matters” changes? </p><p>Because it will. Eventually, the market shifts. There’s a competitor or a Black Swan-style event in the industry (like, say, a global pandemic). Suddenly the well-oiled machine needs to adapt and change course. For companies larger than 100 people, this is tremendously difficult in an in-person environment. Working remote, it’s damn near impossible. Twice-a-year in-person meetups are not enough to disseminate brand new strategies. </p><p>And I'd bet that as formerly IRL companies go remote, it will have a negative effect on their ability to iterate and adjust to market conditions making them vulnerable for a smaller, co-located upstart.</p><h2 id="remote-work-can-stifle-your-career-growth">Remote work can stifle your career growth</h2><p>Think back to your first job in your current field. I’d bet there is a person or group of people who were tremendously important in shaping your career. They gave you candid advice and were able to passively observe and critique your behavior.</p><p>When you work remotely, mentorship is stifled because there is no learning via osmosis. You can’t model your behavior on your successful teammates because you only see them on Zoom and in Slack. Whatever process they are using to achieve their results is opaque to you. </p><p>Much of the language used around remote work (and remote events) assumes that one is in the mid-to-late stages of their career. When you’re young, you don’t need “focus” or to “get things done.” You need exposure to new ideas and people. You need the serendipitous fortune of sitting in on the right meeting, attending the right happy hour, or earning the respect of the right observer.</p><p>All of the above is more difficult in a remote environment. As a result, we are in danger of having a generation of new knowledge workers who are never properly onboarded and hastily told to work remotely with nothing but an OKR to chase. They have no context for how to do all of the messy office-ready skills like building consensus, having productive disagreements, and advocating for their ideas.</p><p>Additional…</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

Astronaut Gene Cernan had been telling the story of how<a href="https://petapixel.com/2012/12/06/the-last-man-to-walk-on-the-moon-left-his-camera-for-a-long-term-gear-test/" target="_blank"> he left his camera</a> on the lunar rover<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/9728289/Apollo-17-commander-left-camera-on-moon-40-years-ago.html" target="_blank"> for years</a>, recounting the tale in interviews:</p><blockquote><p>"I left my Hasselblad camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass. So, going up the ladder, I never took a photo of my last footstep. How dumb! Wouldn’t it have been better to take the camera with me, get the shot, take the film pack off and then (for weight restrictions) throw the camera away?"</p></blockquote><p>It’s easy to accept Cernan at his word - he’s an American hero who flew to space three times, twice to the moon - so as far as everyone was concerned, including the press, the camera was right where he said he left it. Plus, a quick scan of the Apollo 17 stowage list reveals no mention of a lunar surface camera splashing down with the command module. So why the mystery? </p><p>Looking closer, there’s a sprinkling of evidence in photos and transcripts that suggest his camera did in fact return to earth, contradicting both the 1972 NASA inventory and the astronaut. No, don’t cue the dramatic music… there’s no mischief or intentional deception here. I believe Gene Cernan did leave a camera on the lunar rover, just not “his.”&nbsp;Memory can be a fickle thing, even for heroes, and that rings especially true in this case&nbsp;when the story involves not one camera, but three.</p><h2>A tale of three cameras</h2><p>When you’re going to the moon, you’re assigned a camera with a 60mm lens that gets strapped to your chest to document samples, experiments, and the lunar terrain. Both astronauts get their own, clearly labeled with a sticker on the side: “CDR” for commander and “LMP” for lunar module pilot, but they weren’t mutually exclusive, often being swapped throughout the mission based on what film they were shooting with. On Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt - LMP and geologist extraordinaire - was set up with the black &amp; white film. When he needed color, he’d grab Cernan’s camera and vice versa. </p><p>A third Hasselblad camera was also to be used on the mission; it was a bit of a beast really, boasting a 500mm telephoto lens meant to capture distant lunar features for, you know… science. Of the two astronauts, Cernan got stuck looking down the barrel of the 500mm the most, so it’s entirely possible that <em>this</em> is the camera he remembers leaving on the rover. In fact, the post-flight analysis of the transcript pretty much confirms it. But what happened with the other two?</p><h2>The stowage list says they stayed </h2><p>A little background. As each Apollo mission launched, NASA prepared a final stowage list that documented all the equipment aboard, detailing what was to be transferred between each spacecraft before and after landing on the moon. This list was then revised in real time as plans changed due to time or weight restrictions. In the latest revision of the <a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17stowage.pdf" target="_blank">Apollo 17 LM Lunar Launch Stowage List</a>, dated December 12th, 1972, the three cameras that went down in the LM are all marked as “offloaded,” meaning they were left on the surface. The problem is, they launched from the moon on December 13th! So if extra items were brought onboard, it’s not recorded. At least not in what’s available online.</p></div></div><div><div><div data-aspect-ratio="55.70987654320988" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594649779919_85920"><div>

As you read the following excerpt, Cernan and Schmitt are both standing by the final resting place of the lunar rover at the end of their last EVA.</p><blockquote><p>169:29:44<strong>&nbsp;Parker [Mission Control]:</strong> ...and, Jack, <strong>we're making plans here, to change the camera usage at the end of EVA here.</strong> And we're going to let you take Commander's camera out to the ALSEP and take a few photos which people think we need. And Gene's going to take your camera out and document the geophone, when he deploys it. We will not deploy it for the long-term experiment, however. <strong>And we'll bring both (cameras) back, and carry them to the ETB when we get done.</strong></p><p>169:30:17&nbsp;<strong>Cernan:</strong> Okay.</p><p><em>[When he said "document the geophone", Bob may have been referring to documentary photos of the seismic charge Gene will deploy near the VIP site.

Presumably, the intent was to recover the camera at some future date to get information of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.]</em></p><p>[Cernan - "Parker said 'We'll bring them both (that is, both cameras) back,' but I know what I did with that camera. I left it on the Rover pointed straight up. <strong>That's what I planned to do and that's what I did. </strong>I can remember specifically wedging it - I don't remember exactly where - somewhere up between our seats."]</p></blockquote><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Fast forward to where the astronauts are now back at the LM &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</em></p><blockquote><p>170:39:59&nbsp;<strong>Parker [Mission Control]: </strong>Okay, and we gather an ETB coming up with two cameras in it.</p><p>170:40:04&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt:</strong> ETB's next.

One update for the post-sleep procedure. I understand you brought in the LMP's camera, and we want to be sure you get that into the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-JettBag.html" target="new">jett bag</a>&nbsp;before the final jettison here. And, by the way, you're Stay for that final jettison.</p><p>183:40:39&nbsp;<strong>Schmitt: </strong>Okay, Gordy. It's already in the jett bag, thank you. (Pause)</p><p><em>[</em><strong><em>Cernan </em></strong><em>- "Obviously, I did not leave the LMP's camera on the Rover pointed at the zenith. But I swear I put something there. It's possible it could have been the 500 lens, because we didn't bring it back and I mentioned it was under the seat. I know that I did something with a camera. Now, it could have been a lens. And I stuck it between the seats, sort of wedged it in somewhere, and pointed the lens toward the zenith."]</em></p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "Houston wanted us to jettison the camera because they didn't want us to take pictures of Ron Evans' EVA. They had decided it was too cumbersome and too risky. But, we were going to ignore them, and we figured out how we could do it. But we needed a camera. Ron had a camera, but it was not EVA-qualified."]</p><p>[<strong>Cernan</strong> - "We had made up our minds we were going to take pictures of Ron."]</p><p>[<strong>Schmitt </strong>- "And we needed a lunar-surface camera to do it."]</p><p><strong>[Cernan - "Now, we did put the LMP's camera in the jett bag, so we must have had mine."]</strong></p></blockquote><p>*Click*. Finally, we have some clarity. One 500mm camera stays behind, and of the two that go up into the LM, the LMP camera gets jettisoned back to the surface before launch. Cernan’s camera leaves with them as they blasted off live on TV and in color.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594997167739_70248"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Before we get into the details of how to train your subconscious mind, let’s understand the importance of positive thinking and how does the subconscious mind work.</p> <p>There was a time in my life when I was trying hard to improve my financial situation. Despite being a qualified IT professional with more than 12 years of work experience, I was unable to find work for myself. So I decided to make it on my own and started freelancing for clients.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But very soon, I found myself failing miserably to generate sustainable income, and as time progressed, I started becoming angry and frustrated. I started criticizing everything and everyone around me, my relationships suffered, and I started losing health.</p><p>Before I even realized I was grossly overweight, I was having lower back pains and bouts of migraine tension headaches (programmers know what I’m talking about).</p><p>Things were going from bad to worse for me. It took me some time to realize that I needed to clear this pool of negative energy, which I had built around me and be more accepting of what life has to offer me.</p><p>Most people tell themselves, “Oh, I’ll be happy once I achieve this or that,” and that’s the root cause of their misery in the first place.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>You can manifest whatever you desire in life, and the universe will assist you, but you have to approach it with positivity. Positive thinking changes our outlook of life and fills us with compassion and love. Once I understood this, things started rolling for me.</p><h2>So what exactly is the subconscious mind?</h2><p>Most people believe that the human mind has dual nature, the conscious or the rational mind, and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is aware and contains all thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, and is more logical.</p><p>A subconscious mind, on the other hand, is like a reservoir or a vast database that contains all types of thoughts, memories, feelings, and emotions.</p><p>Unlike the conscious mind, the subconscious mind lacks the discriminatory capability of what is good or bad. It believes whatever your conscious mind tells it. And that’s the reason why it is so powerful.</p><p>The only way to program the subconscious mind is through the conscious mind. So if you repeat positive affirmations such as, “I am a happy person, I will succeed in my endeavors, I will achieve financial freedom”, your subconscious mind will start believing it. Even in times of greatest adversities, you will stay strong and focused on your goals.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>On the other hand, if you repeat negative affirmations such as, “I don’t deserve success, I can’t afford that car, I’m bad at managing relationships”, the mind will start believing that and may drive you into depression, anxiety, and fear.</p><p><em>The subconscious mind
can be our best friend or our worst enemy. It can be whatever we want it to be.</em></p><p>The subconscious mind is reactive, and it reacts to the nature of your thoughts. Did you know that the subconscious mind makes up more than 90% of your mind, as opposed to the conscious mind?</p><p>How many times have you tried quitting smoking and failed? How many times did you try losing weight but ended up gaining instead? How many times did you start a project just to leave it midway or when you were just about to finish? Why does this happen to us? This happens because we have not programmed your subconscious mind properly.</p><p>Now that we understand how the subconscious mind works, let’s explore the various ways in which we can harness its power to be more productive and successful in life.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><h2>Mindfulness Meditation</h2><p>Meditation is one of the most powerful tools to train your subconscious mind. In meditation, we go deep inside ourselves and observer our thoughts and emotions. We simply become the witness without judging or being affected by the thoughts we generate.</p><p>If you want to get started with meditation, check out the free <a href="https://mindfulnessquest.com/meditation-guide/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Meditation Guide</a>.</p><p>Meditation helps you to advance spiritually by making you calm inside, and psychologically more stable. By practicing it every day, you slowly learn to confront your fears and negative emotions and are no more affected by them.</p><p>Start by sitting in a comfortable posture. You can be seated on the ground in a cross-legged position, or if that’s uncomfortable, just sit on a chair with your spine erect. One of the simple techniques involves watching the breath as if it moves in and out of your body.</p><p>Start by doing this every day for just 10 minutes and gradually increase the time as you become more proficient in it.</p><h2>Positive Affirmations</h2><p>Earlier, we touched upon this briefly and saw how the conscious mind could be used as a tool to train your subconscious mind. If there were no consciousness or awareness, it would be impossible to train the subconscious mind and avail the infinite potential it offers.</p><p>One way is to use Affirmations. The main process here is to keep repeating a particular behavior over and over again until the message is deeply ingrained in your subconscious mind. For example, if you want to lose weight, keep telling yourself, “I’m not going to stop my workouts until I shed 10 pounds”.</p><p>One thing to note here is that you should not take up a challenge that far exceeds your present capacity. Otherwise, this will not work, and this is the main reason why people fail in their resolutions.</p><p>For example, don’t try to lose 20 pounds in 1 month is you are overweight. Be practical while making your affirmations, and choose a small target initially. Once you achieve your goal, increase the challenge.</p><p>Here is a list of some of the most common affirmations
people use to train their mind:</p><ol><li>I will think positive.</li><li>I will not judge others and be critical of them.</li><li>I will spread love and joy to others because I’m happy inside.</li><li>I am a spiritual being with infinite potential to love.</li><li>Each day I will make an effort to learn something new.</li><li>I will keep a smile on my face throughout the day, even if no one talks to me.</li><li>I will not let negative though pull me down.</li></ol><p>By repeating such affirmations, you tremendously boost your self-esteem, develop empathy towards others, tone down your ego, and increase your confidence.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>You must make an effort to believe in your affirmations (with emotions). If you don’t believe what you are saying, your subconscious mind will not get the message. Just like meditation, affirmations also require daily practice.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are many other techniques which I will be covering shortly in other articles.</p><p>One of the most important books that helped me to learn about the subconscious mind is “The Power of Subconscious mind”. If you’re interested, you can check out this <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/301V3wS">book here on amazon</a>.</p><p>You can significantly increase your productivity by tapping the hidden powers of your subconscious mind. It just takes 30 to 40 minutes of your time daily, and the benefits are tremendous. Don’t take my word for it; just try it yourself and see.</p><p>Present times offer us unlimited opportunities, but the reason why we fail in our objectives is that we get distracted. Distractions are all around us in various forms.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Our conscious mind has to deal with a lot of information at the same time. Through meditation, we get clarity as to what is useful and what is not, and positive affirmations allow us to transfer positive messages to our subconscious. Through repeated practice, we form habits that stick for life.</p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/" data-pin-do="buttonBookmark" data-pin-color="red" data-pin-height="128"><img src="https://mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png" ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" data-ezsrc="//mindfulnessquest.com/ezoimgfmt/assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png"></a></p></div></div>]]>

July 26, 2020 | https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><h2 id="scene">Scene</h2><p>It was a bright, Saturday morning, July 4, 2020. I had just gotten Max all situated with breakfast and cartoons (Mighty Mike, if you’re curious). Julie was sleeping in like she usually does on every day I have off. I’m an early riser and this is a cherished part of our co-parenting. It gives Max and I time to bond (when he’s not stuffing his face and laughing at cartoons). I sat down with my laptop to plow through the week’s personal email.</p><h3 id="the-e-mail">The e-mail</h3><p>“Oh look, the AWS bill, I should have a laugh at that,” I thought to myself. Until recently, it had been pennies a month for some very light SES usage. In February, I moved off Google Cloud back to AWS. The primary motivation was that Google had so intertwined GSuite and GCP IAM that it became overly confusing.</p><p>Along with that migration came the CDN for this web site (cdn.chrisshort.net). I mean <a href="https://chrisshort.net/low-cost-content-delivery-network-cdn/">a Cloudflare fronted S3 bucket that holds assets deemed too big for git</a> when I say CDN. It’s not even <a href="https://chrisshort.net/">chrisshort.net</a> itself, as it is hosted on Netlify’s CDN and every other static site I own or manage. I’ve been a Cloudflare user for a long time. The CDN is less than 300 files and has existed for over five years on various clouds. Moving it back to AWS from GCP bumped the AWS bill to an average of $23/month. Not too bad given the <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/suwvjwwc/chrisshort.net">site’s traffic</a>.</p><h3 id="the-shock">The shock</h3><p>Not on this Saturday morning, nope. June 2020’s AWS bill was a heart palpitation causing <strong>$2,657.68</strong> (<a href="https://chrisshort.net/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/invoice498711077_redacted.jpg">JPG</a>). I audibly gasped, “Keep your shit together.” I thought to myself. Max was leaned up against me drinking his milk. I know he could tell something was wrong because he looked at the laptop screen. I only assume when he saw letters and numbers, he thought, “Adult stuff… These cartoons and this Cinnamon Toast Crunch tho.” 2020 being the year that it is and my military history being what it is, I’ve been diagnosed with a panic disorder (on top of the PTSD and physical injuries).</p><h3 id="the-panic">The panic</h3><blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Good morning, $2700 AWS bill!</p><p>Holy shit...</p></div>— Chris Short (@ChrisShort) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1279406322837082114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2020</a></blockquote><p>I immediately began having a panic attack. As I took the mental steps to mitigate the onset of the panic attack, I started forming a battle plan. Yes, I can switch back to emergency mode, like back in the old days, when something would go bang or boom, and I’d run towards it (it’s not helpful overall, trust me).</p><p>First, Max: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs? Check.<br>Next, me: As if it was destined, my alert for morning medications went off.</p><p>“Daddy’s gotta grab his meds, bud.” Instinctively, Max leans off me (wow… okay… he’s used to hearing that reminder and statement shortly after that; my brain is now in overdrive). I take everything I need to conquer this while still being able to function cognitively. I refill my coffee and grab a laptop charger.</p><h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2><p>Check the source of truth.</p><p>What’s diverged?</p><p>How do we get things back to normal?</p><p>I login to the AWS console, hoping I got some output that was uniquely off this month. Weirder stuff has happened (like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/41926/">S3 going down</a>). This bill couldn’t be more out of the norm than ever. This AWS bill is several hundred dollars more than our mortgage! I hit the AWS Billing page and am deeply saddened by what I see:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f2dd17bc5d8e1407c22b84f7f981a7ad9888eba/8e235/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-bill-landing-page.png" alt="AWS Billing landing page showing a $2,657.68 balance"></p><p>There it was. <strong>$2,657.68</strong>, staring at me. “This can’t be legit.” Drilling down even further, it looks like it is indeed legitimate traffic from the cdn.chrisshort.net S3 bucket in us-east-2. In total, <strong>more than 30.6 terabytes of traffic</strong> had moved out of that one S3 bucket. WHEN?!? Did this just happen? Nope.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3373f05e910b0938aeed4a2975b4b4f48922fdc0/2e223/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/aws-june-2020-data-transfer.png" alt="AWS data transfer billing break down"></p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46294144a86a5d64df074d306386b3024b7d882a/af2d6/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/june-23-24-2020-s3-breakdown.png" alt="S3 Activity"></p><p><strong>30.6 TB?!?!</strong> how is that even possible???<br>$1,011.59 on 23 June 2020.<br>$1,639.07 on 24 June 2020.</p><p>I immediately open a ticket with AWS Support frantically wondering what broke? How is this even possible? Did someone bypass Cloudflare? What the hell is Cloudflare saying?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6cd3322753f262dc51bbca44a07fef6b19b381e9/52aec/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_22_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 22 June 2020"><br>Oh cool, Cloudflare let those 2,700 requests passthrough completely uncached? How is that not anomaly detected as a DDoS??? How is it that barely a fraction of the traffic is cached (more on that later)?</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a0f7d1526c44cb74baba13f749f3d5a886bbdadb/6d2b1/the-aws-bill-heard-around-the-world/cloudflare_june_23_2020.png" alt="Cloudflare 23 June 2020"><br>Oh, another 4,400 requests the next day… Sweet, baby Jesus. Oh, but you served 9 GB from cache. Thanks, Cloudflare.</p><h2 id="help-arrives">Help Arrives</h2><p>Apparently, when you tweet something crazy af, like a $2700 AWS bill, it gets a lot of attention on a quiet holiday morning. A quarter-million people saw the tweet and a third of them interacted with it. It was enough attention that the AWS Support Twitter account was on it before, <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1186319925901586432">my friend</a> and <a href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/">cloud economist</a>, Corey Quinn.</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh no! 😰 Sorry to hear about this unpleasant Saturday morning surprise, Chris.

I am forever thankful to Corey for his analysis. When he was ready, Corey sent me a list of things he needed to do an analysis (instead, I created him a regular IAM account with the proper perms 😉 and yes I cleaned up after).<p>Corey encouraged me to apply a bucket policy that would only allow Cloudflare IP addresses to access anything from the bucket. The theory here is that someone could have been bypassing Cloudflare somehow. But, thankfully, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/">Cloudflare publishes their IP blocks</a> and they don’t change all that often. The Cloudflare support article, <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037983412-Configuring-an-Amazon-Web-Services-static-site-to-use-Cloudflare#77nNxWyQf69T1a78gPlCi9">Configuring an Amazon Web Services static site to use Cloudflare</a> gives you an example bucket policy to do exactly that. This should become a standard practice for folks. However, it wouldn’t have mattered in this case; more on that later.</p><p>Corey Quinn’s thread on the topic covers what happened on the AWS side pretty well:</p><blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That's right--it's threading time!<a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisShort?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chrisshort</a>'s surprise <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a> bill of $2700 looks S3 driven... <a href="https://t.co/VnXufn24iA">https://t.co/VnXufn24iA</a> <a href="https://t.co/tKLWv5rHtW">pic.twitter.com/tKLWv5rHtW</a></p>— HydroxyCoreyQuinn (@QuinnyPig) <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280280727133642753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 6, 2020</a></blockquote><ul><li>”…it’s almost entirely due to us-east-2 data transfer out…”</li><li>“Now, what caused this? Nobody knows!”</li><li>“Chris Short isn’t some random fool…” (Might be the nicest thing Corey’s every said about anyone he’s not related to)</li><li>”‘Surprise jackhole, your mortgage isn’t your most expensive bill this month, guess you shoulda enabled billing alarms!’ is crappy, broken, and WOULD NOT HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM!”</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280289410844471296?s=20">“I want to be explicitly clear here: Chris Short didn’t do anything wrong!”</a></li></ul><h2 id="but-wait-there-s-more">But wait! There’s more!</h2><p>I had tickets in with Cloudflare (1918916) and AWS (7153956931). Cloudflare was the least helpful service I could have imagined given the circumstances. A long term user and on and off customer thinks they were attacked for two days and you don’t lift a finger? If I didn’t have reason enough to move off of Cloudflare, I do now. That’ll be an update for a later blog post. But, if you work for a CDN company and you’re relatively painless to get up and running, I’m interested in hearing from you.</p><p>After a very chaotic morning, I take Corey’s advice, disconnect, and enjoy the holiday weekend.</p><h2 id="more-help-arrives">More Help Arrives</h2><p>On July 8th, an astute AWS employee starts doing some digging around and reaches out to me. Because they see this as bafflingly as Corey and I do. How did so few requests generate so much traffic so quickly and then as soon as it appears, it’s gone again? It doesn’t seem like something intentionally malicious either because Cloudflare and AWS let it right on through.</p><h3 id="here-s-the-theory">Here’s the theory</h3><p>In hindsight, I made a poor decision to distribute a trial Windows 2019 SQL Server virtual machine images (fully patched with all necessary drivers and VM extensions) in the form of a qcow2 file. Someone became aware of the existence of this VM image. They then stood up hundreds, potentially thousands, of copies this VM using the internet accessible URL. This is, in theory, possible, with something like <a href="https://chrisshort.net/tags/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://kubevirt.io/">Kubevirt</a>. Given that the disk image becomes a volume mount in the corresponding VMs pod. Spin up enough copies of the VM, a single YAML file can create infinite copies of a VM. If the YAML definition directly referenced the Cloudflare or S3 URL and not a locally cached copy, you can rack up the number of times you pull down an image real quick. The qcow2 image, in this case, was 13.7 GB. But it’s trickier than that.</p><h3 id="the-sharp-edge-of-the-cloud">The sharp edge of the cloud</h3><p>File this under, “Things I should’ve known but didn’t.” Did you know that “The maximum file size Cloudflare’s CDN caches <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files."><strong>is 512MB</strong></a> for Free, Pro, and Business customers and 5GB for Enterprise customers.” That’s right, Cloudflare saw requests for a 13.7 GB file and sent them straight to origin every time <em>BY DESIGN</em>. <strong>Ouch!</strong></p><p>I suspected these files immediately on July 4 and moved them to an internal work GDrive for the time being. If you need the images, let me know, you’re also a suspect if you ask for them, be warned.</p><p>If you’re sitting at home doing the math, something might not be adding up. The bandwidth cost is off, there was indeed some legitimate traffic to the bucket in June, of course, But, as it turns out the intrepid AWS employee discovered that 3655 partial GETs to the object might have actually been delivered as full file requests and Cloudflare might have ever done anything with them. Yes, this is a bug somewhere and folks are looking into it. I also suggested that object size limits be a tunable S3 bucket policy. This way, I wouldn’t have even been able to upload the files to the bucket, to begin with.</p><h2 id="the-resolution">The Resolution</h2><p>As I mentioned, I’ve removed the multiple gigabyte files from the bucket the day I got the bill (July 4). <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1280282363461726208">Corey pointed that out here</a>. That might have hindered the investigation from the AWS side. I won’t be so quick to delete in the future. I will lock files down though. But, let’s face it. Now that I’m aware of the <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172516-Understanding-Cloudflare-s-CDN#:~:text=The%20maximum%20file%20size%20Cloudflare's,request%20caching%20of%20larger%20files.">512 MB file limit at Cloudflare</a>, I am moving other larger files in that bucket to <a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> for now (and will add them to my supported <a href="https://chrisshort.net/causes/">Causes</a>).</p><p>Long term, I won’t want to store files in …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>
<h3 id="example-configuration-and-prerequisites">Example configuration and prerequisites</h3>
<p>In my lab environment I used three nodes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Role in Swarm</th>
<th>Server</th>
<th>IP</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Manager</td>
<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker1</td>
<td>docker-host2.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>TCP/UDP</th>
<th>Port</th>
<th>What is for?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>TCP</td>
<td>2377</td>
<td>cluster management</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TCP and UDP</td>
<td>7946</td>
<td>node communication</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UDP</td>
<td>4789</td>
<td>overlay network</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Most importatnt parameters for <code>docker swarm init</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--autolock</code> - <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> - enable autolock for manager node - more later in this post</li>
<li><code>--advertise-addr</code> - address for API and overlay networks for other cluster members</li>
<li><code>--listen-addr</code> - address for cluster management</li>
<li><code>--availability</code> - cloud be <code>active</code>(new tasks allowed), <code>pause</code>(new tasks not allowed, but old keeps going) or <code>drain</code>(new tasks not allowed, finish immediately old ones if they exists) - set drain for manager node to create manager without containers on it</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool</code> - by default <code>10.10.10.0/8</code> - we can set another address pool for overlay network created with cluster</li>
<li><code>--default-addr-pool-mask-len</code> - number on subnets that are allow to be created in <code>--default-addr-pool</code></li>
</ul>

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0zwqchv43d2alvl99fgw2mh6cnv7xc8vakspd90yjh4i7eiwwx-cn32plktlwjf8q25azk37ij5v 10.10.10.20:2377

      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Some believe they can work from home as if they are in the office. "Just add
          some tools for video calls and everything will work just fine", they say.
          This cannot be further from the truth. Setting up video is to successful remote
          work as setting up tables is to successful onsite work. You'll probably use
          it, but it's not nearly enough.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Emergency Remote is divided into three succinct sections. The first discusses the
          underlying values required for remote work to function, the second ensures the
          right tools are set up, and the third describes the five immediate actions to
          perform for better remote work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is an easy, quick read. In fact, the average reader will finish the book in
          less than 15 minutes. After following it you'll have enough space to learn
          from the vast resources on remote work </span><span>available </span><span>online and adjust them to fit your company.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>Remote work is composed of three pillars that are crucial to the success of the
          method. They are important to understand before going forward with
          implementation.</span>
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="h.rrpubh4i8p5v"><span></span></h2>
      
      <h2 id="h.1fqjja11bgze"><span>Trust</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is your belief in a colleague's ability to deliver work in the best
          possible way. Note, this does not mean a guaranteed delivery every time, but the
          ability to deliver. It includes asking for help if needed, recovering from
          mistakes and improving for next time.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Trust is essential because trusting others allows you to focus on your actual
          work, knowing they'll deliver. When others trust you, you get that unique
          peace of mind, the freedom to do your work.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without trust, employees will be agitated. Worried that their own work will be
          wronged by employees they rely on, either directly or indirectly. That is an
          impossible way to work, especially remotely.</span>

      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication achieves productive work and </span><span>always-available </span><span>conversations. Both are "evergreen"</span><span>,</span><span> meaning preserved. To accomplish </span><span>that</span><span>, </span><span>two things are needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>First</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>asynchronous (async) communication</span><span> —</span><span> communicati</span><span>on</span><span> without the expectation of immediate response.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Second</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>history preservation</span><span>. </span><span>C</span><span>onversation</span><span>s</span><span> should be kept whole and in orde</span><span>r</span><span>, forever.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Evergreen </span><span>C</span><span>ommunication is essential because it allows employees to always work on
          what's most important, always be up to date, and have the reasoning behind
          every decision at their fingertips. They can jump into any conversation that needs
          them, and answer without sacrificing productive work. New employees could even
          onboard themselves.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without </span><span>Evergreen</span><span> </span><span>Communication</span><span>, we're back to square one. Having everyone present, either in a chat, call
          or physical room forces participants to stop ongoing productive flow. Incomplete
          summaries, as they always are, </span><span>c</span><span>ause information loss and make the reasoning behind decisions </span><span>v</span><span>ague at best.</span>
      </p>
      <h2 id="h.i59vuej2ah6f"><span></span></h2>
      <h2 id="h.30fd3thx8ylx"><span>Independence</span></h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Independence is the state where the employee(s) working on a task needs little to
          no outside involvement. This does not mean that employees will work in silos. Some
          tasks require more than one person to perform. If most tasks require one person,
          it means they are small (as they should) and that team cooperation will take place
          when joining the individual tasks to form a whole.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>It is essential because it makes sure each and every task is self-contained. That
          is, the employees responsible for it have all they need in order to deliver, and
          the risk of them being blocked is reduced. Further, increasing employees'
          resources in this way increases innovation, which again contributes to
          production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Without independence, productive work is undermined. The business will be tangled
          with permissions requests, employees will be blocked by their privileged
          counterparts, and innovation will halt at the face of bureaucracy. All of these
          are detrimental, more so in a remote environment, where bureaucracy is harder to
          deal with, and therefore should be prevented.</span>
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
        <span>You will only need four tools to be productive remotely. A tool used as a single
          source of truth and three tools used for the three forms of communication: async,
          hybrid and sync. That's it.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>All employees should have access to as much material as your company's level
          of transparency allows, without complex permissions or process.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Each tool will have an example using a specific brand. While many brands supply
          these tools, make sure to only use one for each categor</span><span>y</span><span>. Different teams prefer different tools, but they cause duplication and
          fragmentation, which harms productivity.</span>

        <span>Single Source of Truth</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>The Single Source of Truth is a website or collection of files that always
          represent the up-to-date and true state of work. It must adhere to Evergreen
          Communication and track changes and their reasoning, allow rollbacks to previous
          versions and keep communications async.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Once this is set up, everyone should always update the work and communicate in
          regards to the single source of truth. Gone are the days of files scattered across
          various emails.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span>
          Google Docs for a law company will hold all strategies, contracts, company
          policies, and so on. Every change done for the client or </span><span>to</span><span>
          company policy will be reflected immediately to all involved. Changes are always
          tracked, previous versions preserved, and </span><span>d</span><span>iscuss</span><span>ions are evergreen</span><span>.</span>

        <span>Async Communication: Task Manager</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>Tasks should be managed using a task manager, a type of software. </span><span>They</span><span>
          should be discussed and when done, changes should be made to the source of truth.
          Task managers are completely async, have reproducible history to understand </span><span>past</span><span>
          decisions, and always show the state of work, making status meetings
          redundant.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>This is the hardest tool to choose, as it is company specific. Take </span><span>time</span><span>
          to test different options. If the one you have doesn't work for you, change
          it. Communicate this to your employees</span><span>. P</span><span>revent disruption </span><span>with gradual adoption</span><span>. </span><span>You will find one that works.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #1:</span><span> Trello or Asana for a law firm. </span><span>E</span><span>mployees could open tasks, involve others and</span><span> jump i</span><span>n to help. A paralegal may open a task "Fix typo in website", the IT
          person may reply "Currently overwhelmed", then a secretary may jump in
          "I've built website</span><span>s </span><span>before, can I help?". This kind of </span><span>exchange is impossible</span><span> to achieve without the three pillars</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>It</span><span>
          happens in remote companies every day, boosting the heart of the</span><span>ir</span><span> production.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example #2:</span><span> GitLab for software companies. </span><span>These apps</span><span> often double as a source of truth </span><span>with</span><span> their code hosting function and as task managers </span><span>with</span><span> their ticketing (issues, pull requests) system.</span>

      <h2 id="h.siasagdslt5x">
        <span>Hybrid Communication: Chat App</span>
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        <span>While the bulk of communication should be done using the task manager, sometimes
          we need to quickly hash things out. This is where chat apps come into play. They
          are hybrid, neither async n</span><span>or</span><span>
          sync. While it's possible to reply later, it's not easy. </span><span>M</span><span>essages come and go</span><span>,</span><span> pushing people to </span><span>respond immediately</span><span>.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Therefore, for work talk, use these only for quick, ephemeral conversations. Any
          long lasting or high impact communications should use the task manager. Outside of
          work talk, chat plays a big role in socializing and enjoying each other's
          company, an important aspect to preserve when working </span><span>remotely</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Avoid email or WhatsApp as much as you can. They are private by nature and make
          it harder for people to jump in if needed.</span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Example:</span><span> Slack</span><span> or any </span><span>app </span><span>with</span><span> private messages</span><span> and </span><span>public channels will do. Employees could publicly commend a team member for good
          work in the general channel, or offer feedback privately. They could hop into the
          memes and music channels for fun, ask in the IT channel if anyone noticed a system
          slowdown, or share research about </span><span>new</span><span> strategies in the marketing channel.</span>

Haskell provides lightweight user space threads that get scheduled by the Run Time System (RTS) onto a limited number of operating threads in a so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#M:N_(hybrid_threading)">M:N threading model</a>. To handle blocking there are a few options, <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">about which I have written before</a>. For system calls on file descriptors that can return <code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>, the RTS provides an I/O (not to be confused with <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_IO"><code>IO</code></a>) event manager where threads can register interest in a file descriptor before putting themselves into a sleeping state. If and when the file descriptor becomes available for reading or writing, the event manager will <a href="http://www.wjwh.eu/posts/2020-07-10-haskell-thread-blocked.html">wake up</a> any threads that have registered interest in it. The event manager system contains a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs">manager module</a>, which provides the interface for the rest of the Haskell code. This module will choose the most performant option from <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Manager.hs#L169-178">a number of backends</a> available on the current system. So, it will choose the <code>epoll</code> backend on most Linux systems, the <code>kqueue</code> backend on BSD systems, etc. This article is about the design and first results of a new event manager backend based on the <code>io_uring</code> interface.</p>
<p><em>Side note: quite recently a native I/O manager for Windows systems was merged into GHC. Sadly, I don’t know enough about it yet to meaningfully include it into this article. As such, the information provided is only valid for POSIX-like systems.</em></p>
<p>The <code>io_uring</code> interface was added in the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Linux-5.6-IO-uring-Tests">Linux kernel version 5.1</a> as an improvement to the earlier <code>aio</code> interface for asynchronous system calls. It operates by allocating two ring buffers that are shared between the kernel and the userspace program, known as the Submission Queue (SQ) and the Completion Queue (CQ). The program puts any number of system call requests (known as Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)) into the SQ and can submit any number of them to the kernel with a single system call. The kernel then goes off to do the things requested and when (or if) the request is complete the result will be put into the CQ as a Completion Queue Entry (CQE). This means that the userspace program can check if any CQEs are available merely by checking the CQ, without having to do any system calls. This potentially saves a lot of work on context switches between the kernel and userspace for I/O heavy programs like web servers. As of the time of writing, there are SQEs available for file reading/writing, accepting network connections, polling file descriptors and several more. The author of the <code>io_uring</code> interface has stated that he intends to eventually provide asynchronous versions of all system calls where it makes sense. To implement an I/O event manager backend with <code>io_uring</code>, we only need the SQEs for polling and cancelling previous poll requests, but it would be interesting to see how much of <code>io_uring</code> could be leveraged to provide “true” asynchronous system calls in the future.</p>
<h2 id="iouring-backend-design">IoUring backend design</h2>
<p>Any I/O event manager backend must conform to <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/libraries/base/GHC/Event/Internal.hs#L25-51">the interface defined for it</a>, which looks like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Backend</span> <span>=</span> <span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> <span>Backend</span> {</span>

<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27"></a>    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That seems pretty reasonable, only four functions! Actually, there is also a <code>new</code> function to set up the backend so it’s more like five functions. ACTUALLY actually, the <code>_beModifyFd</code> function has three different modes of operation depending on which of its arguments are <code>mempty</code>. It can be either “add a polling request”, “modify a polling request” or “delete a polling request” so it is more like seven functions. Still, that is quite manageable. The interface description even describes what each function should do and which arguments it takes, which is more than I usually got in my previous day job.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/bgamari">Ben Gamari</a> had already written Haskell <a href="https://github.com/bgamari/io-uring">bindings</a> for using <code>io_uring</code> that could be adapted for an I/O manager backend. He was also a huge help in finding a segfault-causing bug that I would never have caught myself. Many thanks!</p>
<p>An interesting implementation detail of <code>io_uring</code> is that every SQE has a <code>userdata</code> field that gets copied over verbatim into the CQE for its completion. As we can see in the type signature for <code>_bePoll</code> we need both the original file descriptor and the events to issue the callback. In the earliest version, the new backend generated a unique <code>Int</code> for each request and stored this information (along with a Bool indicating whether the poll request was a “multishot” or not) in a hashtable. This worked, but testing showed that throughput was only about half of what the <code>epoll</code> backend could provide. After some discussion on the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, we realized that it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field">bitpack</a> all the required data into the 64-bit <code>userdata</code> field. This cleared up the code significantly and provided a nice speed boost as well.</p>
<p>The code of the new backend can be found <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/WJWH/ghc/-/tree/io_uring_manager">over here</a>. At its heart, it is a <code>popAndCallbackAllCQEs</code> function. It is implemented as follows:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>-- The workhorse of this backend. Pops CQEs off the ringbuffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span>-- and issues callbacks to waiting threads</span></span>

<p>This function pops CQEs off the CQ and after un-bitpacking the <code>userdata</code> field of the CQE, performs the callback. It then recurses until <code>popCq</code> returns <code>Nothing</code>, indicating that there are no more unread CQEs to be consumed. Even in this small bit of code it’s already clear how many edge cases can occur. Some backend-internal CQEs don’t have an associated callback, so for this case we should skip that. If a multishot poll request fails, blindly resubmitting might result in an infinite loop of erroring poll requests.</p>
<h2 id="test-results">Test results</h2>
<p>To test the relative performance of the <code>io_uring</code> backend compared to the <code>epoll</code> backend, I needed an application that spends as much of its time as possible on pollable I/O. The <code>network</code> package provides sample code for a simple echo server which I adapted into <a href="https://gist.github.com/WJWH/97a102791e6ee08d98cc20145d9ba29a">an extremely basic HTTP server</a>. This program was compiled twice: once with the <code>epoll</code> backend and once with the <code>io_uring</code> backend. Then two <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/"><code>t3.xlarge</code></a> VMs with 4 CPU cores and 16 GB of RAM were acquired from AWS, one to host the test programs and one from which to run the <a href="https://www.petefreitag.com/item/689.cfm"><code>ab</code></a> HTTP load generator. I ran <code>ab</code> against each program in batches of 10.000 requests at concurrency levels of 5, 50 and 500 concurrent requests. To average out any jitter, each test run was performed three times and the results averaged.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/uring_graph_white.png" title="Haskell logo"><br>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the <code>io_uring</code> backend provides about 7% more requests per second (in this toy benchmark) at 5 concurrent requests, about 9% more requests per second at 50 concurrent requests and about 1.8% more at 500 concurrent requests. Presumably, at very high levels of concurrent requests other bottlenecks start to dominate performance. After sharing these findings in the <code>#ghc</code> IRC channel, I was advised to increase the size of the GC nursery to 16 MB (up from the default of 1 MB) and track the RTS performance statistics with the <code>-s</code> RTS option.</p>
<p>It turned out that at low concurrency the backends performed much the same, but at higher concurrency levels the <code>epoll</code> backend started spending much more time in garbage collection than the <code>io_uring</code> backend. This was mostly caused by the amount of retained objects being much larger for <code>epoll</code>, and as we all know <a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2020-04-07-lessons-in-managing-haskell-memory.html">GC time is related to heap size in Haskell</a>. In one particular case, <code>epoll</code> had a maximum residency of no less than 1,021,622,432 bytes (almost a full gigabyte) while <code>io_uring</code> reported a maximum residency of only 1,553,680 bytes, a reduction in memory use of almost 98.5%! This also resulted in GC pauses of almost 200 ms for the <code>epoll</code> backend to traverse all that memory, while the <code>io_uring</code> backend reported a maximum GC pause time of only 12 ms. Since most programs will also do other things than just report a single in-memory string back to callers this result is unlikely in “the real world”, but it is still remarkable. I suspect that the difference is caused by the <code>epoll()</code> syscall returning all the available file descriptors in a big array that the backend then <code>forM_</code>s over to perform the callbacks. The <code>io_uring</code> backend on the other hand can pop CQEs off the CQ one at a time and reclaim the memory for that CQE almost …</p></div></div>

<p>I’m no longer active on Facebook, but at the moment, oddly, it’s my main goto option to find out at least some of the companies that share my data.</p>



<p>Facebook lets you see who shared your data with them. There are two interesting pages, buried and well-hidden, worth checking: <strong>Off Facebook activity</strong> and <strong>Businesses who uploaded and used a list</strong>.</p>



<p>Want to see which companies are sharing your data? continue reading.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/off_facebook_activity/activity_list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Off Facebook activity</a></h2>



<p>This one is very interesting and I recommend visiting the link to check our your own list. I won’t share the screenshot, but from what I gathered, all this information was leaked via apps on my iPhone, before I’ve disabled ad tracking. I’ve written about it before: <a href="https://blog.gingerlime.com/2020/does-apple-care-about-your-privacy/">Does Apple care about your privacy?</a> and I recommend reading it, if only to know how to disable ad tracking on your Apple devices.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Businesses who uploaded and used a list</a> </h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-892x1024.png 892w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-261x300.png 261w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who-768x882.png 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/dave_who.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<p>My list can be divided to roughly 3 categories:</p>



<ol><li>Companies I know and use. Amazon, Uber, etc. So whilst they know me and I did give them my details, I <strong>never explicitly gave them consent to share my details</strong>. With Facebook or with anyone… </li><li>Companies I’ve heard of, but never signed-up for, used nor shared any details with. <strong>How the f*** do they even have my details?</strong> not to mention share them with Facebook (or who knows what other companies)</li><li>Companies I’ve never heard of, but <strong>the name alone looks really dodgy</strong>. “Mindshare Biddable Digital” … you can imagine what a company with this name is doing. </li><li>Dave M. Rogenmoser. He probably deserves his own category. I don’t know him, never heard about him, and frankly now want nothing whatsoever to do with him. Dave, if you’re reading this, WTF are you doing sharing people’s personal details with Facebook? especially people who you don’t know and definitely didn’t give you consent to share details of.</li></ol>



<p>Ok, so this was 4 categories I guess… Although Dave might more realistically fall into the 3rd one.</p>



<h2>What does it mean?</h2>



<p>In case you can’t read the text on the image, this is what Facebook tells us about it</p>



<blockquote><p>These businesses uploaded a list to Facebook. Lists can contain contact information, for example an email address or phone number that is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hashed</a> so that Facebook does not learn any new identifying information about you. Lists can also contain advertising identifiers instead of contact information. Information from lists is matched against our existing list of users. The identity of users is not revealed to the business during the matching process.</p><p>Facebook uses these lists only to match the information to your profile and to deliver the ads chosen by the advertiser. Facebook does not keep the information shared in these lists. Advertisers can use lists to show you more relevant ads or to exclude you from ads that may be less relevant to you. For example, if you’re already a member of a gym then the gym could choose to exclude you from ads about becoming a member.</p><p>Facebook doesn’t learn any new identifying information about users when lists are uploaded. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=information_about_you&amp;section_id=interacted#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Learn More</a></p></blockquote>



<p>So, let’s decipher things a bit here, shall we?</p>



<h2>Hash data</h2>



<p>Technically, it’s true that Dave and his friends don’t share my personal details directly. i.e. they won’t upload my actual email address to Facebook. They will upload a <em>hash</em> of my email. But then, Facebook obviously holds its own giant list of hashed emails and other personal details, so then when two hashes match, Facebook knows that it’s me. That’s the way they can show me this list of companies.</p>



<p>So is this data sharing? I think every reasonable person would think so. Obviously now Facebook knows more about me. At the very least my (forced) association with those companies. Their claim that “Facebook doesn’t learn <em>any new identifying information</em>…” is technically true, but practically false, because this association is super valuable. Not only for allowing advertising to place ads, but I imagine to increase the richness of the user profile and what Facebook knows about you.</p>



<h2>Lookalike audiences</h2>



<p>I’m not 100% sure about this, but I think that’s another thing to worry about: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lookalike audiences</a>. When companies upload lists of emails to Facebook, they not only do it in order to target those users directly, but rather to also discover <em>similar</em> people. People who are likely to be interested in their ads.</p>



<p>So whilst Facebook doesn’t reveal any extra information about me directly with advertisers who upload my details, these companies get a huge “prize” for sharing my data with them: These companies are then able to <strong>target ads to people with similar interests to mine</strong>.</p>



<p>Add the fact that now Facebook knows more about us, because they not only see how we interact on Facebook or sites that use the Facebook like buttons etc, this practice feeds even more knowledge (and golden opportunity) to Facebook. So if they know X people who (like me) use Amazon, Uber, and Share Now, perhaps they are also likely to be interested in using Grab? So both Facebook and those companies have a <strong>clear interest sharing my data. But are they allowed to?</strong></p>



<h2>Legitimate business and consent</h2>



<p>Let’s leave Facebook out of it for a moment… Are these companies allowed to share information about me with <em>any other company</em> (Facebook or otherwise), without my explicit and informed consent?</p>



<p>I’m not a lawyer, but here’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/recital-40-lawfulness-of-data-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recital 40 of the GPDR</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</p></blockquote>



<p>The way I understand it, personal data should be processed either based on “some other legitimate basis”, or on the basis consent.</p>



<p><strong>Legitimate basis</strong>, in very simple terms, is when the data is necessary to provide the service. For example, if I sign up to Amazon, they need my email to send me order confirmations. That’s a legitimate basis. But using my email for marketing or advertising stops becoming a legitimate basis. Why? because it is not <em>required</em> to provide the service that Amazon provides me.</p>



<p>So if Amazon wants to send me ads, or share my email for other purposes that aren’t realistically legitimate, they are <strong>required to ask for my informed and explicit consent</strong>.</p>



<h2>“But hey! They didn’t share your personal data! They only shared a hash…”</h2>



<p>Technically they “only shared a hash”, but this hash identifies me clearly. I believe it falls under personal data under the GDPR as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the GDPR, Personal information</a> is (emphasis mine):</p>



<blockquote><p>… any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who <strong>can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as</strong> a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></blockquote>



<h2>It gets even stranger</h2>



<p>If I dig a bit deeper into my list of companies, I saw that one of them actually shared my details with Facebook in order <em>not</em> to show me ads. This is actually one of the examples that Facebook gives when they explained about the Gym.</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for the Gym (they will not waste money on advertising someone who is already their member)</p>



<p>It’s definitely good for Facebook (they will sell more targeted ads, increasing the value of their platform to advertisers)</p>



<p>Is it good for me? some might say yes, because I won’t see the Gym ads any more. But at what price? I will still see other ads. And now Facebook knows that I’m a Gym member. I’m sure lots of advertisers would jump on the opportunity to sell me some Gym gear. I think I’m much worse-off here.</p>



<h2>What can we do about it?</h2>



<p>If you have a Facebook account, I highly recommend checking those two pages I linked to and seeing which companies are sharing your data.</p>



<p>The thing I wonder about most though, is what <em>other</em> companies my data is being shared with. Companies I have no way whatsoever to see such a list…</p>



<p>I guess the best thing to do is to contact these companies and ask them to stop it. Or to file a GDPR complaint. I would also recommend checking out <a href="https://noyb.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NOYB</a> (None Of Your Business). It’s a privacy non-profit organization that does some great work in this area. Sign up and become a member if you want to support their work further.</p>

<blockquote><p>How can I ensure my customer won’t share the video they purchased? Can I protect the PDF I sell to be shared only once? How can I lock my daughter in a high tower, so that no worldly harm befalls her?</p></blockquote>



<p>The tension between sharing our creations and being paid was always tricky. But the digital world adds another layer of complexity – your creations can be copied and distributed also <b>after the purchase</b>, keeping you out of the loop of future profits.</p>



<p>A natural instinct is to seek the answer in the technology that permitted sharing in the first place – can I protect the content I sold, so that only the customer has access to it?</p>



<p>Yes, but you shouldn’t. Over-protecting your content focuses on extraction over providing value. Here are 10 reasons why (Digital Rights Management)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">1</a>] DRMs are a bad idea:</p>



<h3>1 – It is just impossible to prevent sharing</h3>



<p>Trying to effectively protect content against sharing is like fighting against skilled guerilla units in the digital jungle. Sure, you can deploy your defenses, but they will always find a sneaky way around them while you drain your resources.</p>



<ul><li>You will use streaming service to gate-keep your videos, They can use a project similar to `youtube-dl` to download any video file.</li><li>You will block downloading images on the page, they can just take a screenshot.</li><li>You can password protect a PDF, they can use a „virtual printer” to generate a new, open one.</li></ul>



<p>If you give a customer <b>any way </b>to access the content, that way can also be used to copy that content and/or record it.</p>



<p>This is a fundamental feature of the Internet. Content is meant to be easily reproducible and shared. The only way to win is to make it easier and more compelling to pay.</p>



<h3>2 – You are treating your customer like a thief</h3>



<p>Imagine if visiting your friend was like going through airport security. Did you bring any liquids? What’s that in your backpack? Oh no, your belongings are 300 grams too heavy, better pay for extra luggage!</p>



<p>Jumping through DRM hoops is sending a clear message to all your customers:</p>



<p><i>We don’t trust you. You have to go through this process because we think you may steal something. We’re watching you.</i></p>



<p>This message gets sent whenever a person who decided to pay you opens their purchase. It’s your biggest fans’ first experience with your product.</p>



<h3>3 – People who steal are not your customers</h3>



<p>Do you have a portrait of your ideal customer?</p>



<p>Is it a teenager sitting in a warez bulletin board all day and polishing his torrent workflow? If not – <strong>why are you focusing on them?</strong></p>



<p>People who download loads of content are not used to paying for it. When they won’t be able to find a free copy of <u>your</u> content – they will steal from your competitor or resign before they open their wallets.</p>



<p>And if you don’t know who your ideal customer is – maybe you should focus on that.</p>

<h3>4 – But they may become them</h3>



<p>Sure Artur – but what about when somebody buys something and then gives away to all their friends?</p>



<ol type="a"><li>What do you think about sharing books? Borrowing a blender? Some sharing is healthy and natural.</li><li>It actually benefits <b>you</b>.</li></ol>



<p><b>Bootleg content is a customer acquisition mechanism.</b></p>



<p>The most successful Internet entrepreneurs build sophisticated sales funnels. For example, they would have many interactions with the customer before they buy:</p>



<ol><li>A visitor interested in your field finds your article online.</li><li>After the second article, they sign up for your email list.</li><li>You provide consistent value and build up trust.</li><li>After a few months, you release a product and the follower becomes a customer.</li><li>Profit.</li></ol>



<p>Even if they try to “convert” their friends to trust you too, the friend lacks the relationship you have built. They didn’t receive your emails and they didn’t laugh at your corny jokes.</p>



<p>Demonstrating the full value of intellectual property requires giving it away. Once the friend sees the value you provide, they will either:</p>



<ol type="a"><li>Be blown away by the quality.</li><li>Decide it’s not for them and they will never be your customer.</li></ol>



<p>Both of these outcomes are ideal for you and save you considerable time in the signup funnel and marketing.</p>



<p>This is what trial period and discounts aim to accomplish, but they have side-effects. When you repeatedly discount, customers start treating the lower price as the ‘real’ one, and value the product less because ‘it must not be worth the full price’. Keeping a blind eye to questionable behavior gives you a way out. You can demonstrate how valuable your product is, without discounts that lead to price erosion.</p>



<p>People who “sneak onboard” often become customers themselves – and even the most loyal ones! The converted always are.</p>



<h3>5 – You are making it hard to enjoy your content.</h3>



<p>Open standards empower creators to build new tools or use the content in unpredictable ways. Things are better connected. These are the core assumptions under which the Internet was built. You will not be able to predict all the weird, fantastic, and inspiring ways your content will be accessed.</p>



<ul><li>I may read your PDF on an iPad, iPhone, Android tablet, Kindle, or printed out,</li><li>I frequently save workout or yoga videos to watch while being offline in the garden or on the road,</li><li>I like to read the text in my Pocket or Kindle apps.</li></ul>



<p>Any sort of „protection” breaks my ways of consuming your content and often makes it useless for me. Sometimes enough to give up on something I have paid for (<i>and that is the reason I stopped doing yoga, your honor</i>).</p>



<div>
<h4>Sign up to get Deliberate Internet straight to your inbox</h4>
<p>I write about the psychological and technical aspects of the Internet, focusing on remote work, online economy, and cognitive load. Every monday.</p>






</div>



<h3>6 – You are blocking people with disabilities from accessing it at all.</h3>



<p>I can manage the inconvenience with some grumbling – however, not everybody has that luxury. Tools that people with disabilities rely on are by nature incompatible with any sort of content protection schemes. Content protection’s entire purpose is restricting access to the narrow subset of users and use cases.</p>



<p>Mind you, that <u>you yourself will join</u> those “people with disabilities”. You will get older, lose a little clarity in your vision, and suddenly the new sexy apps developed by 20-year olds in their glass palaces will become confusing and unusable.</p>



<p>Helping my grandparents navigate the changing digital landscape is a sad and sobering experience. Any additional hoop that you make them jump through may render your content inaccessible.</p>

<h3>7 – You are turning your creation into a commodity</h3>



<p>The best online businesses rely on fostering the relationship between you and your customers. You share some free content, they are more receptive to trust you with their hard-earned money. It’s a dance of mutual respect and the first sale is only a part. If they like what you are doing, they will return for more, or even support you financially.</p>



<p>DRM software turns this delicate relationship into buying a sack of coal under the watchful gaze of security. <i>Not even a fistful too much! You are being watched</i>.</p>



<p>You are signaling to your customer that this is a purely monetary transaction. They are not entitled to even sharing your work with a friend, because they would be violating rules ?. Oh, the rules.</p>



<h3>8 – Are you really losing anything?</h3>



<p>If you are selling digital products, what is your marginal cost? How much do you pay to create another copy of your PDF, video, software?</p>



<p>When your content is being shared, it is <u>not stealing.</u> You don’t lose your income whenever somebody downloads a copy. As I mentioned – people who are likely to download illegal copies of your work are either never going to be your customers, or they will because they had a peek.</p>



<h3>9 – What is your true motivation for blocking the content?</h3>



<p>What is the core motivation for trying to protect your piece? Is it some misplaced sense of justice or is it legitimately best for your customer?</p>



<p>If that content truly makes you proud and you believe it would help them – what is the best outcome if the customer does not want to pay? Is this motivation coming from a place of fear?</p>



<ul><li>Fear of your work being „not good enough” to pay for?</li><li>Fear of the offer not being compelling enough?</li><li>Fear of not having enough paying customers to make it all worthwhile?</li></ul>



<p>Fear is not a good place to create amazing content people are going to love. This mindset will drag you down and prevent you from soaring into creative skies.</p>



<h3>10 – What do you choose to believe about people?</h3>



<p>Do you really want to believe that people are only waiting for an opportunity to steal? Or do you want to trust them to appreciate the value you provide?</p>



<h2>What can you do instead</h2>



<ol><li>Focus on the relationship with the customer. I have written a little more about it in<a href="https://piszek.com/2020/02/03/hospitality-vs-commodity/"> Your product is either hospitality or a commodity</a>.<br>I believe that all kinds of digital goods will be commoditized sooner or later. The only “moat” you can build is the customers’ trust.</li><li>Put the energy you would spend on DRM into innovation and creating new products. Once your old one gets shared, you should be already releasing a new one.<br>Subscriptions are an effective form of protection here – instead of sharing your content once, you drip the value to the customer – and they see the benefits of paying you.</li><li>Sell more. Get more paying customers – after all, it’s about how many customers <b>choose to pay you</b>, not how many choose not to.</li><li>Raise prices. Focus on the customer who is not driven to pay less, but the one who is driven to get more value. Paradoxically, more expensive products get downloaded less.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>Now go, create, and sell.</em></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong><em>Note: this web article is an older version of a paper which has now been published as an ICFP Pearl. You can find a preprint of that paper <a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub-paper">here</a>.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>It’s probably better to read the paper rather than this post, as the paper contains more material, is more up to date, and is better explained!</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Algebraic subtyping</strong> is a new approach to global type inference in the presence of subtyping. It extends traditional Hindley-Milner type inference while preserving the principal type property — that is, it can always infer <em>the</em> most general type for any given expression. This approach was developed by <a href="http://stedolan.net/about/">Stephen Dolan</a> as part of his PhD thesis, along with Alan Mycroft.</p> <p>Algebraic subtyping was implemented in <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/mlsub/">the <strong>MLsub</strong> type inference engine</a>. However, the design of MLsub seems significantly more complex than the simple unification algorithms used for traditional ML languages. MLsub has proven harder to grasp, even for people already familiar with compilers and type systems, such as myself.</p> <p>Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I wanted to get to the bottom of the algebraic subtyping approach. What really is special about it, beyond the formalism? What are the simple concepts that hide behind the strange notions of <em>biunification</em> and <em>polar types</em>?</p> <p>This article is an answer to those questions. I propose an alternative algorithm for algebraic subtyping, called <strong>Simple-sub</strong>. Simple-sub can be implemented <strong>efficiently</strong> in <strong>under 500 lines of code</strong> (including parsing, simplification, and pretty-printing), and I think it is much more familiar-looking and easier to understand than MLsub.</p> <h4 id="---you-can-try-simple-sub-online-here---"><strong>⇨ ⇨ ⇨ <em><a href="https://lptk.github.io/simple-sub/">You can try Simple-sub online here!</a></em> ⇦ ⇦ ⇦</strong></h4> <p>This article is meant to be light in formalisms and easy to consume for prospective designers of new type systems and programming languages.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/LPTK/simple-algebraic-subtyping">The complete source code of Simple-sub is available on Github.</a></p>   <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2> <ol> <li> <p><strong><a href="#intro">Introduction</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-mlsub">Algebraic Subtyping in MLsub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#algebraic-subtyping-simple-sub">Algebraic Subtyping in Simple-sub</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#simplifying-types">Simplifying Types</a></strong></p> </li> <li> <p><strong><a href="#conclusions">Conclusions</a></strong></p> </li> </ol> <hr>  <p>The ML family of languages, which encompasses Standard ML, OCaml, and Haskell, have been designed around a powerful “global” approach to type inference, rooted in the work of <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307%2F1995158">Hindley</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2F0022-0000%2878%2990014-4">Milner</a>, later closely formalized by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582153.582176">Damas</a>. In this approach, the type system is designed to be simple enough that types can be unambiguously inferred from terms without the help of any type annotations. That is, for any unannotated term, it is always possible to infer a <em>principal type</em> which subsumes all other types that can be assigned to this term. For instance, the term $\lambda{x}. {x}$ can be assigned types $\mathsf{bool} \to \mathsf{bool}$ and $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, but both of these are subsumed by the polymorphic type $\forall a.\ a \to a$, also written <code>'a -&gt; 'a</code>, which is the principal type of this term.</p> <p><strong><em>Hindley-Milner</em></strong> (HM) type inference contrasts with more restricted “local” approaches to type inference, found in languages like Scala and C#, which often require the types of variables to be annotated explicitly by programmers. On the flip side, abandoning the principal type property allows these type systems to be more expressive and to support features such as object orientation and first-class polymorphism. Note that in practice, even ML languages like OCaml and Haskell have adopted expressive type system features which, when used, break the principal type property.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p><strong><em>Subtyping</em></strong> is an expressive feature allowing types to be structured into hierarchies (usually a subtyping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)"><em>lattice</em></a>) with the property that types can be <em>refined</em> or <em>widened</em> transparently following this hierarchy. This lets us express the fact that some types are more precise (contain more information) than others, but still have a compatible runtime representation, so that no coercions between them are needed. For instance, in a system where the type <code>nat</code> is a subtype of <code>int</code>, one can transparently use a <code>nat list</code> in place where an <code>int list</code> is expected, without having to apply a coercion function on all the elements of the list. Subtyping can be emulated using somewhat heavy type system machinery (which both OCaml and Haskell occasionally do<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>), but first-class support for subtyping gives the benefit of simpler type signatures and better type inference.</p> <p>For a long time, it was widely believed that pervasive implicit subtyping got in the way of satisfactory global type inference. Indeed, previous approaches to inferring subtypes failed to support principal types or resulted in the inference of large, unwieldy typing schemes which included sets of complex constraints, making their understanding by programmers difficult.</p> <p><strong><em>Algebraic subtyping</em></strong> was introduced by Dolan and Mycroft as an ML-style type system supporting subtyping and global type inference, while producing compact principal types. Here, <em>compact</em> refers to the fact that the inferred types are relatively simple type expressions without any visible constraints, making them easy to understand by programmer. This was achieved by carefully designing the syntax and semantics of the underlying subtyping lattice, allowing for simplifying assumptions in to be made the constraint resolution process of the type inference algorithm.</p> <p>However, <em>biunification</em>, the algorithm proposed by Dolan in order to implement algebraic subtyping, has been quite difficult to understand for many experts and non-experts alike. Indeed, on the surface it looks quite different from the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_J"><em>Algorithm J</em></a> traditionally used for Hm type systems: it requires several additional concepts, such as bisubstitution and polar types, making it look more complicated.</p> <p>Thankfully, it turns out that algebraic subtyping admits a type inference algorithm, which I called <em>Simple-sub</em>, that is very similar to the familiar Algorithm J, and also much more efficient than biunification (or at least, than the basic syntax-driven form of biunification.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> In this article, I show that inferring algebraic subtypes is actually extremely easy, and can be done in under 300 lines of Scala code. Most of the complexity actually comes from simplifying the inferred type representations, which we will get to later.</p> <p>While the implementation we present is written in Scala, it is straightforward to translate into any other functional programming language.</p> <p><strong><em>The goal of this article</em></strong> is to recast algebraic subtyping into a simpler mold, allowing more prospective designers of type systems and programming languages to benefit from the great insights that this approach offers.</p> <hr>  <p>Let’s start by briefly reviewing what algebraic subtyping and MLsub are and what they are not, and by trying to assess their expressiveness.</p> <h2 id="term-language">Term Language</h2> <p>The term syntax of MLsub is given below. I have omitted boolean literals and if-then-else, as they can easily be typed as primitive combinators. I also used only one form of variables $x$, which will be sufficient for our use (Dolan’s MLsub formalism distinguishes lambda-bound variables from let-bound variables for technical reasons).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$x$</td> <td><code>x</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>lambda</td> <td>$\lambda{x}. {e}$</td> <td><code>fun x -&gt; e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>application</td> <td>$e\ e$</td> <td><code>e e</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record creation</td> <td>$\{\ l_0 = e \,;\; … \,;\; l_n = e\ \}$</td> <td><code>{ l_0 = e; ...; l_n = e }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>field selection</td> <td>$e.l$</td> <td><code>e.l</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>let bindings</td> <td>$\mathsf{let}\ x = e\ \mathsf{in}\ e$</td> <td><code>let x = e in e</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="type-language">Type Language</h2> <p>The type syntax of MLsub, summarized below, consists in booleans, function types, record types, type variables, top $\top$ (the type of all values — supertype of all types), bottom $\bot$ (the type of no values — subtype of all types), type union $\sqcup$, type intersection $\sqcap$, and recursive types $\mu{\alpha}. {\tau}$.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>name</th> <th>formal syntax</th> <th>ML pseudo-syntax</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>primitives</td> <td>$\mathsf{bool}$, $\mathsf{int}$, …</td> <td><code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, …</td> </tr> <tr> <td>function</td> <td>$\tau \to \tau$</td> <td><code>t -&gt; t</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>record</td> <td>$\set{\ l_0: \tau \,,\; … \,,\; l_n: \tau\ }$</td> <td><code>{ l_0: t, ..., t_n: t }</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>variable</td> <td>$\alpha $</td> <td><code>'a</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>top</td> <td>$\top$</td> <td><code>⊤</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>bottom</td> <td>$\bot$</td> <td><code>⊥</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>union</td> <td>$\tau \sqcup \tau$</td> <td><code>∨</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>intersection</td> <td>$\tau \sqcap \tau$</td> <td><code>∧</code></td> </tr> <tr> <td>recursive</td> <td>$\mu\alpha. \tau$</td> <td><code>t as 'a</code></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="informal-semantics-of-types">Informal Semantics of Types</h2> <p>While most MLsub type forms are usual and unsurprising, two kinds of types require our special attention: set-theoretic types (more specifically union and intersection types), and recursive types.</p> <h3 id="set-theoretic-types">Set-Theoretic Types</h3> <p>To a first approximation, union and intersection types can be understood in set-theoretic terms: the type term $\tau_0 \sqcup \tau_1$ (resp. $\tau_0 \sqcap \tau_1$) represents the type of values that are <em>either</em> (resp. <em>both</em>) of type $\tau_0 $ <em>or</em> (resp. <em>and</em>) of type $\tau_1$.</p> <p>MLsub uses these types to indirectly constrain inferred type variables; for instance, one type inferred for term $\lambda{x}. {\set{l = x - 1 \,;\; r = x}}$ could be $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,,\; r: \alpha}$. This type reflects the fact that the original argument, of type $\alpha$, is returned in the $r$ field of the result record, as the input type $\alpha$ ends up in that position, but also that this argument should be able to be treated as an $\mathsf{int}$, expressed via the type intersection $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int}$ on the left-hand side of the function type. Keeping track of the precise argument type $\alpha$ is important: it could be later substituted with a more specific type than $\mathsf{int}$, such as $\alpha = \mathsf{nat}$, which would give us $\mathsf{nat} \to \set{l: \mathsf{int} \,;\; r: \mathsf{nat}}$.</p> <p>On the other hand, there may be type signatures where some $\alpha$ becomes undistinguishable from $\mathsf{int}$. For instance, consider the term $\lambda{x}. {\mathsf{if}\ \mathsf{true}\ \mathsf{then}\ {x - 1}\ \mathsf{else}\ {x}}$, whose simplified inferred type would be just $\mathsf{int} \to \mathsf{int}$, as the seemingly-more precise type $\alpha \sqcap \mathsf{int} \to \alpha \sqcup \mathsf{int}$ does not actually contain more information (see the MLsub paper for details).</p> <p>The beauty of algebraic subtyping is that this sort of reasoning scales to arbitrary flows of variables and higher-order functions; for instance, the previous example can be generalized by passing in a function $f$ to stand for the $\cdot - 1$ operation, as in …</p></div></div>

<p>This is just a story of my day. It was an incredibly boring day. Why do I write about it? I analyzed why it was so dull and uncovered a great insight. What is the most critical factor in software engineering productivity? I think it is the time it takes to deploy your app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Beautiful start of the day</h2>

<p>I woke up at around 10 am. Not too bad, given that I’ve stayed late the night before – I have been trying to solve an engineering problem at work. The problem was adding a new feature to the gigantic project with a not so scalable architecture. The project was born out of the hackathon, so it’s nobody’s fault… Anyway, the engineering problem. It wasn’t even that hard because as soon as I woke up, I had it all figured out in my head. I just needed my morning coffee first.</p>



<p>I started coding right after my first sip. Something really happened in my head during sleep, because it felt so easy to write code. The solution was pretty obvious, and it did not introduce any unneeded complexity to an already chaotic code base. It looked good, so I ran the code locally. Oh, yes, I forgot to import the module here. Oops, this variable is NULL now, let’s fix that. Okay, it seems to work now. So I committed changes to my branch and created a PR. It’s 11 am on the clock. Pretty sweet as a start of the day, ha? Now what? Even if I solved the problem, it’s not going to do much good without getting into production. Now it’s time to get my code to the finish line.</p>



<p>My open PR had automatically triggered tests. We have all kinds of tests: unit, integration, code style, you name it. I knew I had some time because this process is not usually fast. However, I didn’t have enough time to shift my focus to another task or fully relax. So I kept on checking my messengers, social apps, and news feed. Then a message arrived in Slack. “Lint-check failed.” Oh, I hate those! I thought I had everything right! Okay, it looks like I forgot to remove this import, and it’s not used anymore. I removed one line from the code and committed my changes. 5 minutes wait, again. What’s going on on Twitter?</p>



<h2>We all hate waiting</h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg" alt="The picture of a man looking at his phone waiting for the code deploy to finish." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-40a3cf24fa0ff15d8ce804678017d6d3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I did not notice how 15 minutes passed. Then I got another slack message – integration tests failed. At least my code style is right. So, I spent another 5 minutes fixing the issue (integration test actually did an excellent job catching a tricky bug, so I’m not mad at it). Then I committed my changes and played the waiting game again.</p>



<p>I understand the importance of tests, but 20 minutes, come on! Of course, I could’ve made some progress on another task, meanwhile. No, not really. I don’t know about you, but I hate switching focus. It takes so much time to get into a really focused state. So I’ve checked all my apps on the phone a couple times and found the bottom of the twitter feed before I saw a Slack notification about the successful deployment of my code. </p>



<p>Just to be safe, I need to test the app on production to see if the new feature works. From first glance, it did, but there was a small glitch. I had to update the code in the UI of a web application, nothing fancy, just changing a string. This turned out to be a header on the page, and I added redundant whitespace at the beginning, so now it looks weird. Okay, here we go again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now all tests passed, but the deployment took forever. I’m not sure what kind of computation is involved in moving a folder with files around 10 megabytes from my laptop to the server, but it sure feels like it could’ve trained a conscious AI by now. I don’t remember how much time it took for me to refresh the page and finally see the whitespace disappear, but it definitely took another cup of coffee. I managed to check my emails during this time, so I was productive, I guess. Anyway, it’s 2 pm, and it’s time for lunch.</p>



<h2>How much time we waste</h2>

<p>As you may have noticed, I’m complaining. That day I really spent around 1 hour actually solving an engineering problem, including bug-fixing time. But it took me 4 hours until I saw my changes in production. There are many days like this, so time adds up. I feel righteous anger because this thing is common in the industry, and many people experience the same thing.</p>



<p>So, what’s the solution? Not writing tests? Of course, not, tests are freaking great. The issue is more generic – it’s all those inefficiencies that are easy to introduce to the deploy time (I bundle tests and all CI/CD stuff in the deploy time). It’s easy to write an inefficient CI/CD job. Its intent could be positive, and at the time, it may seem like a great idea. But a little delay is multiplied by the number of people working on the project and frequency of changes they make. Because deploy time affects EVERY contributor and EVERY code change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Slow deploy means slow feedback loops. Imagine you’re an artist. Now imagine each time you move your brush on the canvas, you need to wait 5 minutes before the paint appears. That would be the most annoying thing ever.</p>



<h2><strong>The feedback loop (deploy) has to be fast</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg" alt="The picture of an artist that compares painting and seeing result with the feedback loop of software deploy." srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d.jpg 900w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-300x169.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/4mp.19d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photomania-3b673bff843c3985e1f74841e58ef65d-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></figure>



<p>I believe that each developer who likes to solve creative problems needs to have a fast feedback loop. You change the code – “snap” – it’s updated on the server – “snap” – you see the result.</p>



<p>Please think about this next time you want to add something to the deploy time. And also, think about improving deployment speed next time you work on technical debts. If you cut just 1 minute for a project with 5 contributors, each of them contributing once a day (only on workdays), it saves more than 100 hours a year. And I don’t know how to count improved productivity because of not having to switch the focus, but for me, it would multiply this time by 2 at least. To create better software, we need to improve how we write software.</p>



<p>PS. There is a great talk that inspired me&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">https://vimeo.com/36579366</a>. You should check it out, it’s mind-blowing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a post in a series of posts :</p>
<br>
<div><p>
As my regular readers know I reluctantly trust anything that isn't tested and battle proof. In the last 2 years, I applied the same logic that I apply to vulnerability research to the Data Privacy environment and proceeded to test a broad range of Data Subject Rights. Expect a few disclosures following this one.</p><p>

In true Information Security Fashion (insiders will understand) have attributed this weakness the ID :</p><ul>
<li><b>CDPWE-0001 - Does not designate a Representative in the European Union</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<br></div>
<p>
When I searched Google for my name an interesting website came up in the results. A company called "Rocket Reach" allowed others to buy access to my personal data. I was intrigued as I have never given any consent for Rocketreach to store (or even sell) my data and I saw no other legal basis for RocketReach processing of my data.</p>
<div>

<p>
"Rocket Reach" a data broker that describes it's service as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Connect directly with the right decision makers, using the world's largest and most accurate database of emails and direct dials.&nbsp;Real-time verified data for 430 million professionals across 17 million companies, worldwide.Trusted by over 5.0 million users — powering sales, recruiting, and marketing at companies large and small.</p>
<p>
Prospect, connect and converse with your leads at scale."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>



<h3>
Issuing a DSAR</h3>
</p>
<p>
On the <b>5th of April&nbsp; 2019</b>, I asked Rocketreach access to my personal data (Data Subject Access Request) and asked for the purpose and the legal basis of processing. Instead of giving me access to my data and reply adequately, RocketReach decided to <b>delete/remove all traces of it </b>and informed me that it did so the same day.</p>

<p>
While it might be surprising to some, this is actually a common reaction to DSARs when the Data Controller realizes the data they have may have no real legal basis.</p>
<br>
<h3>
Filing a complaint&nbsp;</h3>
<p>
On the <b>05th of April 2019</b>, I filed a complaint with the Luxemburgish Data Protection Agency (CNPD). The reference for this complaint is #3018 (For those that want to request information/documents from the CNPD).</p>

<h3>
Waiting for roughly a year</h3>
<br>
<h3>
"We agree with you but we can't do anything, sorry, move on"</h3>
<p>
On the <b>6th of March 2020</b>&nbsp;(<span>1 year!</span>) the CNPD responded as follows (Original Version on top, the Translated version at the bottom).</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><span lang="FR">Monsieur Zoller,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">La
 Commission nationale pour la protection des données (CNPD) se permet de
 revenir vers vous concernant votre réclamation du 5 avril 2019 à 
l’encontre de la société RocketReach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cadre de l’instruction de votre réclamation, la 
société RocketReach nous a communiqué qu’elle considère que ce sont les 
utilisateurs de ses services, et non elle-même, qui sont les 
responsables du traitement pour ce qui concerne les
 données à caractère personnel traitées sur son site internet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Par ailleurs, il ressort également de cette instruction 
que la société RocketReach est une société située aux Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique <b>ne disposant pas d’un représentant dans l’Union au sens de 
l’article 27 du règlement général sur la protection
 des données (RGPD). </b><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Au sujet des responsables du traitement établis dans des
 pays tiers, comme les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, nous souhaitons attirer 
votre attention sur le considérant (116) du RGPD qui précise que:</span></p>
<p>
«&nbsp;<i>Lorsque
 des données à caractère personnel franchissent
 les frontières extérieures de l'Union, cela peut accroître le risque 
que les personnes physiques ne puissent exercer leurs droits liés à la 
protection des données, notamment pour se protéger de l'utilisation ou 
de la divulgation illicite de ces informations.
 De même, les autorités de contrôle peuvent être confrontées à 
l'impossibilité d'examiner des réclamations ou de mener des enquêtes sur
 les activités exercées en dehors de leurs frontières. Leurs efforts 
pour collaborer dans le contexte transfrontalier peuvent
 également être freinés par les pouvoirs insuffisants dont elles 
disposent en matière de prévention ou de recours, par l'hétérogénéité 
des régimes juridiques et par des obstacles pratiques tels que le manque
 de ressources.&nbsp;»</i></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Dans le cas de votre réclamation cela signifie que, <b>bien
 que nous ne partagions pas le point de vue de RocketReach et que nous 
sommes au contraire d’avis que cette société est bien à considérer comme
 responsable du traitement pour les traitements

réclamation</b>. En effet, nous ne disposons pas des pouvoirs de mener des 
enquêtes et de faire appliquer les décisions
 que nous serions amenés à prendre sur le territoire des Etats-Unis 
d’Amérique.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">Nous sommes dès lors au regret de vous informer que nous
 considérons qu’il nous est impossible de poursuivre de façon effective

<blockquote><b>English Translation</b><p>
Mr. Zoller, </p><p>The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) would like to get back to you regarding your complaint of 5 April 2019 against the company RocketReach. </p><p>Rocket Reach has informed us that <b>it considers that it is the users of its services, and not itself, who are responsible for processing personal data processed on its website</b>.  Furthermore, it also emerges from this instruction that RocketReach is a company located in the United States of America that does not have a representative in the Union within the meaning of Article 27 of the General Regulation on Data Protection (RGPD).&nbsp;</p> <p>As regards data controllers established in third countries, such as the United States of America, we would like to draw your attention to recital (116) of the DPMR which states that: 'When personal data crosses the external borders of the Union, this may increase the risk that individuals may not be able to exercise their data protection rights, in particular to protect themselves against unlawful use or disclosure of such information.</p><p>Similarly, supervisory authorities may be faced with the impossibility to investigate complaints or activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventive or remedial powers, heterogeneous legal regimes and practical obstacles such as lack of resources. »&nbsp;</p> <p>In the case of your complaint, this means that, although <b>we do not share RocketReach's view and to the contrary believe <span>that RocketReach is the data controller</span> </b>for the processing of personal data on its website, <b>we are unable to take any further action in relation to your complaint.</b> We do not have the authority to investigate and enforce any decision we would have to take in the United States of America.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>We regret to inform you that we consider it impossible for us to proceed with the processing of your case.</b></p></blockquote>
<div><p>In Summary -&nbsp; Rocketreach has <b>not met the requirement</b> of the GDPR to name an EU representative (Art27) to account for the processing of European Personal Data. <b>In their answer, the CNPD makes it sound like it is optional, it isn't.</b> Instead of pursuing Rocketreach locally on that basis alone, the CNPD just gives up arguing it has no jurisdiction in the US.</p></div>

<p><span>In other words, just don't designate a representative in Europe, build your business model around the exploitation of data from millions of European data subjects and you are fine?</span></p>

<p>
I&nbsp; am fully aware that I could engage in legal procedures myself.&nbsp; That's not in my interest (in this case). The overall question you should ask is: Do we need a European Institution that handles extra-territorial investigations and fines? <b>Why should it take the time, money, and energy from an individual when the DPA is supposed to defend the rights of the data subjects</b>?</p>
<p>
What the CNPD could have done according to [1]</p><ul>
<li><span><span>to impose a temporary or definitive limitation including a ban on processing;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the suspension of data flows to a recipient in a third country or to an international organisation.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to impose an administrative fine pursuant to Article 83, in addition to, or instead of measures referred to in this paragraph, depending on the circumstances of each individual case;</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>to order the controller or processor to bring processing operations into compliance with the provisions of this Regulation, where appropriate, in a specified manner and within a specified period;</span></span></li>

	<div>
		<p>I was on <a href="https://www.insideedition.com/zombie-animals-encounters-terrifying-creatures-rise-42966">Inside Edition last week to talk about zombies</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a weird sentence to type.</p>
<p>While the story was dramatic, television clips are notoriously difficult to discuss anything of real significance. I had two main messages I wanted to get across.<strong> One</strong>, that we can’t be sure what these animals are suffering from just by appearance (this message kind of got missed in the clips they chose) and because of that, message <strong>two</strong>: you shouldn’t approach a potentially diseased animal yourself, but instead call animal control or your local wildlife professionals to come help (at least they did include me saying not to approach these animals).</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/lGACWoZL0-PNLWs0LGJsYz8XoSs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHSNF332IQZR5MZDXT5VKCWWTA.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="410"><figcaption>A “zombie” raccoon, probably infected with canine distemper virus. Photo by Robert Coggeshall.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In all likelihood, most of the animals they showed and that have been recently been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/zombie-raccoons-are-terrorizing-city-youngstown-ohio-180968704/">“terrorizing” individuals in Youngstown, Ohio</a> are suffering from infection with <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Canine-Distemper.aspx">canine distemper virus</a>. This is a virus related to human measles, and like measles, is very contagious. From the name, it obviously affects dogs, but isn’t limited to only dogs. It can also infect raccoons, foxes, opossums, ferrets, and even wild <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/canine-distemper-could-wipe-out-siberian-tigers/">tigers</a>. Among animals, the distemper virus can be transmitted by bites or simple close contact, so it can spread quickly within groups of animals living together. The infected animals then either recover and develop immunity, or pass away from the infection.</p>
<p>The animals exhibiting “zombie” symptoms like those shown in the clip are just the tip of the iceberg. It’s likely that many other animals in the local population are also ill, but perhaps not dramatically so; like any infectious disease, there will be a spectrum of symptoms in infected individuals, so not every wild animal infected with canine distemper will “go zombie.”</p>
<p>Wildlife authorities have noted that these outbreaks of animals acting like “zombies” happen every few years: the virus will sweep through a population lacking <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unforgiving-math-that-stops-epidemics-20171026/">herd immunity</a>, infect many of the individuals, and those who are infected but recover will be immune. A few years later, when the population again contains large numbers of susceptible individuals due to births of new animals, the virus can again cause an outbreak—and the cycle continues over and over.</p>
<p>While canine distemper infection doesn’t cause symptoms in humans, <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Pages/rabies.aspx">rabies absolutely does</a>—and that’s a key reason people need to avoid these animals and leave them to the professionals. Based on the symptoms alone, you can’t tell if an aggressive, strangely-behaving animal is suffering from distemper or rabies. And while distemper isn’t harmful to humans (though it <a href="https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/canine-distemper#1">definitely could be to your dog</a> if they’re not up-to-date on their vaccinations), rabies is almost 100% fatal if not quickly treated with anti-rabies immunoglobulin and prophylactic vaccination. In the rare cases who have survived after symptoms developed, it was only with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm">extreme interventions</a> which are <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/six-year-old-dies-rabies-after-experimental-treatment-milwaukee-protocol-fails-782168">not always able to be replicated</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to see these epidemics of “zombie animals” on a regular basis in different locations around the country—but don’t try to be a hero. That never turns out well in the movies.</p>

Peters sees stuff that no-one else can see, reports findings that no-one else finds, perpetually declares everyone else to be wrong, is vastly prolific, and has been very, very good at sharing and disseminating his stuff online. If Peters were reliable, trustworthy, careful, conscientious, and good at doing science, this would be great, and he would be a significant force for good. </p><p>But Peters is not reliable, or careful, or conscientious, or good at doing science. He is the opposite of those things. And yet he’s on a crusade whereby he aims to share his views – proclaimed by him as representing The Truth – as widely and frequently as possible, all the while decrying the mainstream palaeontological world as if it’s part of a conspiratorial cabal of blinkered elites. Peters is a significant source of miseducation, whose work floods the internet, and who aims to bamboozle those unaware that he’s peddling nonsense.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_546745"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_35989"><p>But at some point between the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became clear from his online writings and published articles that Peters had become <em>very strange</em>. Thanks to a unique kind of magic, super-powered vision, he claimed to find hitherto undetected babies, soft-tissue frills, umpteen new anatomical structures <em>and more</em> on pterosaur fossils. These claims were awfully reminiscent of those fringe announcements on the finding of skulls and bits of technology in NASA’s photographs of Mars or the moon, or of Jon-Eric ‘the fruitbat’ Beckjord’s proposals that frames of the Patterson-Gimlin film reveal hidden Bigfoots lurking in the shadows. Today, the Peters of 2020 thinks that at least some of these claims – documented in Peters (2004) and reported at conferences (e.g., the 2003 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting at San Antonio, Texas, the 2006 Flugsaurier meeting at Munich) – should be ignored as “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”. Making mistakes is part of science, we all do it. But claiming with confidence (in print and at conferences) that you’ve found a ton of incredible stuff that others have not is a red flag, especially when the Peters technique of finding stuff that on-one else can has the vile, distinct stench of pseudoscience about it. And despite arguments that those weird claims of the past were “rookie mistakes” or “old laundry”, the fact is that Peters has never stopped doing whatever it is that he does.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595526977752_41793"><div>

By now, the proverbial cat (a vampire cat, covered in hitherto unseen babies and sporting a <em>Longisquama</em>-like frill of dorsal plumes and with a previously unnoticed long, tassel-tipped tail) was out of the bag, and it became less easy – although not impossible – for Peters to get his stuff into the literature, and presented at conferences. Several of his manuscripts – I believe submitted to such journals as <em>Nature</em> and <em>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</em> and mostly aimed at tackling big picture issues of reptile phylogeny – were rejected at around this time (for the record, I have not ever, not once, acted as a reviewer for a Peters paper).</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_203035"><div>

He stepped up his game online, giving us the outpouring that is ReptileEvolution.com and the updated daily, twice daily, thrice daily, infinity-times daily blog The Pterosaur Heresies. Though starting this grand online project with pterosaurs as his focus, Peters has expanded his interest to include reptiles of all sorts, mammals, all tetrapods and FISH as well. To those mammal, bird and fish experts who didn’t care about Peters when he was just ‘that weird pterosaur guy’, I say… well, now you know what it’s like.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595584636582_92439"><div>

Or, restated: why can’t I just mind my own business and leave Peters alone? I will tell you why. If ‘the published literature’ is regarded as a synonym for ‘the accepted canon of human knowledge’, then efforts to curtail the spread of Peters’ ideas (e.g., <a href="http://bigcat.fhsu.edu/biology/cbennett/Bennett-PT-article.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Bennett 2005</span></a>) have been successful. His efforts to instigate paradigm change (that pterosaurs are lepidosaurs, that mammals are archosauromorph reptiles, that bats are civets, that mysticete whales are desmostylians and so on and on and on and on) have failed and are being ignored by working scientists. </p><p>If, however, you think that material shared online – in blog articles and so on – has some impact on what people think worthy of attention or allocation to memory, Peters is successful. Peters is not, dear reader, just doing his own thing in some quiet corner of the internet, beavering away in earnest, minding his own business. He is instead on some kind of eternal crusade to promote promote promote his ideas CEASELESSLY. I can confirm from working with students, the interested public and even other qualified scientists that his stuff is often assumed to be real science, on equal footing with that of those he criticises. All of which means that his efforts need countering. </p><p>My interest in the dissemination of knowledge and public education, and my respect for the due diligence of those people whose work is criticised, admonished or …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div>

<h4>Gout termed as rich man’s disease caused a significant impact in Europe and US&nbsp;history.</h4>

<p>The king of the Holy Roman Empire laid siege on the city of Metz in France. The blockade would have been an instant victory if the king had barged into the city. Severe pain in his feet delayed the king to start an offensive. The delay caused the king to lose the battle. The entire European monarchy crashed with it. The Kings’s pain was due to a disease that impacted European history for years to come. The condition was Gout, also called as Foot grabber.</p>



<p>Gout has been part of the royal disease list for centuries. Gout is inflammation in bone joints and termed as the Arthritis of the rich. Gout has affected a meager portion of the world population but has influenced some of the world’s significant political events. Gout occurs due to excessive meat and alcohol consumption, which is the trademark of Europe’s aristocratic life. Gout is mostly formed in the feet and caused unbearable pain.</p>



<h4>Charles V’s Gout Problem and Fall of&nbsp;Europe:</h4>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/00cf6-0pfleiado4dmcexib.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Charles V.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charles V was the Holy Roman Empire in Europe and waged war against the French and led a successful crusade. During one of his campaigns, Charles V laid siege on the crucial town of Metz in France. Metz was the last major town in French control. Charles V had the habit of exhaustive drinking and meat consumption due to which Gout developed in his leg. On the siege day due to unbearable Gout pain, Charles V stopped the offensive and took rest. During the period of rest, the French reinforced the town. When he recovered and went for an invasion, Charles V lost the battle. After the loss and due to Gout pain Charles V abdicated the throne and split the Holy Roman Empire among his son and brother. Gout brought in the Holy Roman Empire’s downfall and cut Europe into two factions the Spanish Habsburgs and Austrian Habsburgs.</p>

<h4>William Pitt, the Elder, and US Independence:</h4>

<p>William Pitt, the Elder, was a British parliamentarian who influenced the British parliament. He was the grandson of the famous Thomas Diamond Pitt. William had Gout from a young age and skipped college graduation due to it. William Pitt spoke for the rights of the people in the American colony. When the British parliament voted on imposing taxes on tea, William Pitt spoke against the bill. He convinced many members to vote against the law. Unfortunately, on the final day of the debate, William could not attend the session, which passed the tax bill.<br>The high tax on tea created the Boston tea party and ultimately sown the seeds for the American revolution. Had Gout not caught William that day, American independence would not have happened.</p>



<p>Other famous personalities who had Gout are Cosmo de Medici, Benjamin Franklin, and Henry VIII.</p>



<p>Physicians came up with remedies to the Gout issue with stool or glass boot, but the relief was temporary. Gout got its portrayal as a rich man’s disease due to its patient history.</p>

            <p>
	Churches in Montreal are becoming concerned about hosting community groups after being hit with bills for municipal taxes.</p>
<p>
	Joel Coppetiers, the Minister at the Cote des Neiges Presbyterian church, was shocked when his institution first received a municipal tax bill in early 2015.</p>
<p>
	It was "the first indication that something had changed," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Provincial law exempts churches and manses from paying municipal taxes but Coppetiers was told that if a manse is vacant for several months between ministers, it's taxable.</p>
<p>
	Following that, city officials arrived for an inspection of every room in the church and how they were used.</p>
<p>
	"The indication is there's not an exemption for the church as a whole, there's only an exemption for those areas used for public worship and things directly related to it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	As a result, many churches in Montreal that host community groups, such as food banks, or Girl Guides or Boy Scouts, are facing mounting tax bills.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says the city has changed how it interprets the law.</p>
<p>
	"We're there to care and serve the community and this is part of it," said Coppetiers.</p>
<p>
	Coppetiers says taxes are due even when services are suspended for renovations.</p>
<p>
	The amount owed in taxes can increase swiftly if a church closes its doors.</p>
<p>
	When <a href="http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/trinity-memorial-church-in-ndg-closes-its-doors-1.3302321">Trinity Memorial Church in NDG </a>closed earlier this year, the city started enacting taxes immediately following the last service.</p>
<p>
	As a result churches feel pressured to sell swiftly, with Trinity Memorial being sold to Stanford Properties Group within two months.</p>
<p>
	The issue of places of worship owing taxes and fighting the city's exemptions office came as a surprise to city politicians, including Councillor Peter McQueen.</p>
<p>
	"Already our churches are in danger, they're having a number of financial problems and this is a further low blow," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	The NDG councillor said his party, Projet Montreal, will study the exemption issue, but he said Montreal's Executive Committee needs to step up.</p>
<p>
	"If we don't do something you're going to see churches closed, churches possibly torn down, heaven forbid, certainly converted away from community use," said McQueen.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile churches across the island are praying that the city will cease surprising them with taxes they can't afford.</p>

<p>Last Sunday the 19th July 2020 I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>, a Decentralised, Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like microBlogging Platform.</p>

<p>You can read about my previous <a href="https://www.prologic.blog/2020/07/20/ann-announcing-twtxtnet.html">Announcing twtxt.net post</a>.</p>

<p>Today however I want to share more about <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> and the software behind it <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a>; Why I’ve done all this, Why it is important to me and Why you should care.</p>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="background-story">Background Story</h2>

<p>So before we go into the Why and How, let’s first of all talk about how we go here in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in ~2015 I got head hunted by <a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>™ and after turning them down twice (<em>three was a bit much!</em>) I accepted the offer and relocated my family to the Bay Area at the Menlo Park HQ ala Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>There I spent ~3.5yrs as a Production Engineer (<em>Google it, or think DevOps/SRE if you’re unfamiliar, but not an apt description</em>).
Meanwhile, while I was <em>trying</em> to be good at my new found ay job, interesting developments were happening in the Social Media industry. Not only was Facebook copping flack for the Cambridge Analytics series of events, but <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>™ was going through some changes as well…</p>

<p>Twitter (_allegedly, although I never really got into Twitter myself…)( was introducing new automated algorithms to change what users on their platform saw on their timeline. This has significant impact on usability of the original intended use of the platform. Naturally <em>some</em> users did not like this and sought out other avenues and solutinos.</p>

<p>One such avenue was <a href="https://github.com/bucket">bucket</a>’s <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a>. As I understand it he created a very simple file format specification, a canonical client and unleashed this onto the world! 👏</p>

<p>This was all around ~2016. I was too busy at Facebook to notice :)</p>

<h2 id="present-day-2020">Present Day (2020)</h2>

<p>Fast forward to ~2020 (<em>20th July 2020 to be exact</em>) and a few weeks earlier while I was on holidays I was up late one night just poking around on the Internet (<em>as you do</em>) and looking for “Decentralized Social Media” software. I found quite a few; here are some of the better known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">Diaspore</a></li>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some other not so well known ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gnusocial.network/">GNU Social</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This this very blog’s underlying platform <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> where I now write and publish longer pieces like on my <a href="https://prologic.blog/">Blog</a></p>

<p>There’s even an article on Wired entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/decentralized-social-networks-sound-great-too-bad-theyll-never-work/">Decentralised Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They’ll Never Work</a>! Well I’m here to tell you  I formally challenge this and am here to throw the gauntlet down! 🧤</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way… I <em>might</em> have caught twtxt sooner back in ~2018 when I got back from the US, but I was also (<em>at that time</em>) too busy moving around, working and trying to get bak into our family home that was still being rented at the time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As I said I launched <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>the first of what I hope will be many instances</em>) on Sunday the 19th July 2020. I wrote the software <a href="https://github.com/prologic/twtxt">prologic/twtxt</a> in just a few short weekends in my “spare time” and licensed it under the very permissive MIT license.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>📕 If you haven’t already checked it out, created an account and played around. I would encourage you to do so! I run a freely available for anyone to use instance over at <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are non-technical and read this far… Firstly congratulations I like you already! Second, don’t worry, <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is just a platform to voice/share your thoughts, wisdoms, rambling, short-form text or anything else you want. Think of it like a miniature Facebook or Twitter but without all the advertising or tracking.</p>

<p>I believe in this very simple analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a diary and a Parker™ Pen.
If you then write down your thoughts, wisdoms, experiences, rambling or whatever you want to and share this with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who owns what you have written? The manufacturer of the paper? The manufacturer of the diary? The manufacturer of the pen?</p>

<p>🤔</p>

<h3 id="so-why-why-should-i-use-twtxt-net">So why? Why should I use twtxt.net?</h3>

<p>You should use <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> if you are the type of person that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoys writing and sharing interesting things with others.</li>
<li>Just have interesting things to say in general. Knowledge and Wisdom should be shared!</li>
<li>Are tired of all the issues of all the <strong>BIG</strong> Social Media giants that now plague the f<em>, g</em> and t*.</li>
<li>No longer <em>wish</em> to be the product of Facebook or Twitter and want to <strong>own</strong> your own posts and interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>See whilst <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is brand spanking new, there are a few principles that will always remain true even now and going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NO</strong> User behaviour tracking of any kind.</li>
<li><strong>NO</strong> Advertising anywhere  of any kind.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> be capable of being self-hosted.</li>
<li>Absolutely <strong>must</strong> allow users to take their data somewhere else and use another <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.org/">twtxt</a> client</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="so-how-will-you-make-any-money">So how will you make any money?!</h3>

<p>Good question! Glad you asked. I probably won’t! But one of my primary goals is for users to “Self Host”.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well it simply means that you run your own server instance of the software that is behind <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a non-technical person (<em>which would be true of most people as there are only about ~1M software developers in the world</em>) then you’re probably asking yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But how do I do this?! I don’t know anything about computers! I just use apps!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well don’t worry. Even through (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) it’s really early days for <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> there are plans for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A paid single-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> that is <strong>your very own</strong>, personalised to you, with your own domain name but with all the same features.</li>
<li>A paid multi-user instance of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> with all the same features but more suitable to small communities, schools, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>How much will this cost when it becomes available? Short answer is I don’t know. But I can tell you this, it will cost you less than what you are paying for Facebook and Twitter today (<em>remember that even through the f<em>, t</em>, g* are all FREE, there is an implicit cost, which is to say that you are implicitly paying for it as you are their product!</em>).</p>

<p>Let’s just say that once we’re ready to launch single-click hosted instances for the masses that it will cost you next to nothing. And if you can’t pay for your own instance, just use a friend’s instance or jump on any other instance you can find like <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>!</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-today">twtxt.net Today</h2>

<p>So let’s talk about what <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> can do for you today.</p>

<p>Today you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signup as a new user at <a href="https://twtxt.net/register">https://twtxt.net/register</a></li>
<li>Login at <a href="https://twtx.net/login">https://twtx.net/login</a></li>
<li>Make your first post by entering some prose of wisdom in the text box and hitting Submit!</li>
<li>You can follow other feeds by entering a Nickname for the feed and their URL in <a href="https://twtxt.net/follow">https://twtxt.net/follow</a></li>
<li>You can discover other users on the same instance as you by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/discover">https://twtxt.net/discover</a></li>
<li>You can find interesting external feeds and even external users outside of the instance you’re on by going to <a href="https://twtxt.net/feeds">https://twtxt.net/feeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And most of all. You can have engaging, fun and interesting interactions with all sorts of people! <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> (<em>at the time of writing this</em>) is growing at a rate of ~2-3K requests per day and 3-5 new user signups per day. WOW! 😱</p>

<h2 id="twtxt-net-tomorrow">twtxt.net Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Now there’s still loads more work to do and all of this is happening in “spare time”. No one is paying me or contributors to do any of this. We do this out of the love and kindness of our hearts 💚</p>

<p>Nevertheless progress will continue and here’s what we have planned already:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Native Mobile iPhone / iOS App! 🎉</li>
<li><code>@mentions</code> where you can easily see who has mentioned you in a post (<em>we call them <code>twt</code>s</em>)</li>
<li><code>#hashtag</code> searching where you can see other similar posts that users tag.</li>
<li>Always continuing to improve the UI/UX and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Uploading images/photos! 📷 This will come pretty quickly actually because there is already a demand for this!</li>
<li>Instance&lt;-&gt;Instance interactions. Basically strengthening the first-class decentralised nature of <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a>. 👌</li>
</ul>

<p>——</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So <a href="https://twtxt.net/">twtxt.net</a> is a <strong>FREE</strong> new type of Social Media that has a strong focus on Self-Hosting, Decentralisation without any of the bloat, tracking or advertising that we’ve all come to take for granted.</p>

<p>Join us today!</p>

Come, follow me down into the realm of gloom.” Goethe, <em>Faust</em></strong></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1939, <em>Minneapolis Journal </em>photographer David Dornberg went on a “Camera Safari,” as he called it, through a large cave under downtown Minneapolis. He described it as “a ‘lost world,’ weird and spooky—the darkest spot for adventure into which my four years as a Journal cameraman ever led me.” Some may discount this as sensationalistic tripe, but read the testimony of Roger Kehret, a seasoned Minnesota caver with years of experience, in his 1974 booklet, <em>Minnesota Caves of History and Legend</em>: “When cavers think of remote hard to reach caves it brings to mind scenes of high mountains of the Pacific Northwest or the steaming jungles of the Amazon. The most remote and hard to get to cave that I have ever reached is found on Fourth Street near Marquette Avenue in down town Minneapolis, Minnesota.” This chapter describes my own ordeal to reach this lost world.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave, as it has become known among urban explorers, has also been called “Loop Cave,” “Manhole Cave,” or “Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank Cave.” It got the name from Schieks Palace Royale, a gentlemen’s club that now occupies the Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank building, under which the cave is located. Journalist Kay Miller once described the nightclub as “topless above, bottomless below” because of the underlying cave, but there’s no humanly enterable physical connection between them.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Schieks Cave is the largest natural cave under downtown Minneapolis, extending for a city block through the St. Peter Sandstone. Carl J. Illstrup, city sewer engineer, who discovered the cave in 1904, described it as a “cave shaped like an inverted bowl,” a description that seems puzzling to anyone who has actually been there. (It’s shaped more like a pancake that has gone awry on the griddle, if that helps.) In 1931, an enthusiastic journalist, Fitzsimmons, waxed poetical about “the beauties of the sewer system” and described Illstrup as “the ruler of this fantastic world.” The discovery of the cave in 1904, during which the crews braved “the lethal breath of deadly gases,” is presented as the highpoint of Illstrup’s life.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest known documentation of Schieks Cave is the 1904 Lund survey, which is good for showing the former “creeks” and “lakes” of the cave. Reportedly, the cave was kept a secret for years because city officials feared the public would think downtown Minneapolis was built on a thin shell that would plunge into a hole in the earth. Another concern was that burglars might have worked undetected and bored directly into the bank’s treasure vaults. By 1921 it was reported that “The entire business portion of the city is built over a series of subterranean lakes and caverns as mysterious and baffling as the Mammoth caves of Kentucky or catacombs of Rome.” The 1929 Lawton survey depicts the cave extensively modified by the construction of piers, walls, and artificial drainage systems. It also shows the 75-foot entrance shaft on Fourth Street and the 15-foot shaft from the cave to the underlying North Minneapolis Tunnel, a sanitary sewer.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;"><img src="http://gregbrick.org/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg" alt="1939 Dornberg map" width="738" height="631" data-mce-src="/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DornbergMapLR.28352226_std.jpg"></span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1952 the Twin Cities Grotto, local chapter of the National Speleological Society, visited Schieks Cave, and it was written up for the Sunday supplements. The late architectural historian David Gebhard, author of many architectural guidebooks, was a member of this club. In 1983, a successor organization, the Minnesota Speleological Survey (MSS), visited the cave, and their lurid account of the gloomy cave whose walls were black with cockroaches, and the roaring sewer that ran under it, only fired my enthusiasm to get there someday—one way or another. Perhaps even by climbing up from the sewers rather than down from the streets?</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The earliest published account of someone visiting Schieks Cave without official sanction has been quoted above. In a chapter titled, “The Minnesota Rovers Great Manhole Cave Expedition,” Kehret went on to reveal how the Rovers, an outing club, dressed as sewer workers, surrounded the entrance manhole with barricades, and used a truck-mounted winch to remove the heavy, hexagonal lid (which in recent years has been welded shut). Getting there must have been more than half the fun, however, because Kehret said little about the cave itself, except that it was “almost filled with sand, concrete, pipes and other debris.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1993, John and I examined the storm drains under the Minneapolis loop with the hope of getting into Schieks Cave. Located far below street level, the system drains to the Mississippi River by a large outfall in the milling district. With reference to the most famous sewer of Antiquity, it’s the very “Cloaca Maxima” of Minneapolis. Because no connection from the storm drains to the cave, or to the sanitary sewer known to run under the cave, was found, we shelved the project. Shortly thereafter I left for the University of Connecticut, where I did graduate work on barite mines.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1996 a college student, along with several friends, began a series of attempts to get to Schieks Cave. He created a website, perhaps the first of its kind in this area, called “Minneapolis Draining Archive,” where he posted trip reports of these and other adventures. After exploring the storm drains without result, he tried wading upstream in the North Minneapolis Tunnel (NMT). This sanitary sewer, eight feet in diameter, carries the great river of human waste from the Loop, and runs directly under the cave, as noted above.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">NMT is the very gut of Minneapolis. Wading upstream is fatiguing owing to the swift, chest-deep current (2.5 feet per second), and the well-lubricated invert (floor). Occasionally one of them would lose his footing, even to the extent of full immersion in the warm, gray fluid, and get swept back to the starting point. He persevered to the extent of going two city blocks, with four blocks remaining to get to the cave. In desperation, he considered driving climbing pitons into the sewer walls, but nothing came of it. While NMT has been called a lot of things over the years, my favorite was the “Silk Road,” an allusion, you might imagine, to all the little bits of toilet tissue swirling through there. It took an effort to maintain a sense of humor in such grim surroundings.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In 1999,<em> National Geographic Adventure</em> magazine commissioned a writer to report on urban exploration, which came to focus on the efforts to get to Schieks Cave. By this time I had met him and we agreed to join forces. I advocated an “upstream strategy”: to find a safe entrance to NMT upstream from the cave and “go with the flow,” rather than buck the current. The summer of 1999 was devoted to this task. In keeping with the magazine’s hip, youthful, target audience, however, my critical role in the exploration, without which it would not have succeeded, was to be downgraded to that of a “wizened elder” who “smokes cheap cigars.” All the locations appearing in the photo shoot, for example, were picked by me, and I was the only person who knew how to access them. But I was in my thirties at the time, a bit too long in the tooth for their demographic. By contrast, the youthful explorer was compared with world-renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, apparently for things like crafting a make-shift sewer canoe out of “an old file cabinet.”</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">The first upstream entry point we investigated was the venerable Bassett Creek Tunnel. Running below this storm tunnel for a short distance was a sanitary sewer, the whole thing forming somewhat of a double-decker arrangement. The plan was to drop into the lower tunnel and head downstream to the cave. But upon removing the lids in the floor of the upper tunnel, and allowing the mephitic vapors to exhale, we got cold feet. The sewage just seemed to be moving too fast down there.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">More to be feared, however, was the inferred existence of a waterfall at some point along the sewer line. While at Bassett Creek the sanitary sewer was somewhat near street level, at Schieks Cave, NMT is 90 feet down. Somewhere along the way there had to be a big drop. And the small-scale sewer maps that we had didn’t indicate details of this nature.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">Tracing the sanitary sewer downstream by peeping through the holes on manhole lids, we found a “good lid” farther along, on a little used side street. The sewage was not moving so fast here, but it appeared deeper. Surrounding the manhole with orange cones, we descended a rope ladder and walked downstream. My thigh waders soon overtopped and filled with sewage, so that I appeared to have elephantiasis. Condoms, distended with raw sewage, dangled from the vaults above our heads. The hypothetical waterfall, located near Déjà Vu Nightclub, proved very real. Affixing a safety line to a pipe jutting from the walls, we approached the slippery brink of the cataract and peered into the abyss. I recalled the ending of Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em>, where a chasm opened to swallow the hapless explorers.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">This sanitary waterfall marked the beginning of the deep NMT proper. From here, NMT ran under Schieks Cave and then on towards the treatment plant. We saw ladder rungs in the wall of the dropshaft, in the midst of the waterfall. We briefly toyed with the notion of sealing ourselves in trash bags, diverting the waterfall, and descending the ladder, but it all seemed just a bit too weird. Such situations are dangerous for another reason, namely, that the turbulence of the splattering sewage causes deadly gasses to bubble off. We gave up on that approach.</span></p><p data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span data-mce-style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: normal;">In August, 1999, we investigated another tributary of NMT, running under the warehouse district. We found good lids situated among deserted construction sites, but here again we faced the daunting prospect of a waterfall. Soon after, the young explorer returned to the manhole with his buddies, descended into the tributary on a …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

        <div>

<p>Last week, my dad was asking me why I was proud of this triangle on my laptop.</p>
<p><img src="https://liamhinzman.com/img/vkTriangle.jpg"></p>
<p>I told him that rendering a triangle is complicated: it took me 3 days, and 1000+ lines of code to create the above image. This just made him more confused.</p>
<p>So I wrote this article explaining what the Vulkan graphics API is, how it works, and everything that goes into rendering a triangle with your GPU.</p>
<h2 id="what-vulkan-is">What Vulkan Is</h2>
<p>Vulkan is a graphics API that is designed to provide an accurate abstraction of how modern graphics processing units (GPUs) work. Unlike OpenGL, Vulkan is very verbose. Every detail related to the graphics API needs to be set up from scratch. The upsides to this are that you only use what you choose to, and you can better understand what’s going on in your application and in doing so achieve much higher performance.</p>
<p>This article is intended to be a concise overview of the fundamentals of Vulkan. It was written for somebody who knew Vulkan but has forgotten many of the details (i.e.&nbsp;future me). Most of the information here comes from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2/html/vkspec.html">Vulkan 1.2 Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This article uses the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp/">C++ bindings</a> for Vulkan</p>
<h2 id="vulkan-in-a-nutshell">Vulkan in a Nutshell</h2>
<p><em>From a bird’s eye view, here’s how a Vulkan application works:</em></p>
<p>Vulkan can access <strong>devices</strong>, which let you control one or more <strong>queues</strong>. Queues are how you send a list of commands to the GPU, and they can be members of one or more <strong>queue families</strong>, each of which can do different things (e.g.&nbsp;draw the vertices of a 3D model).</p>
<p><strong>Command buffers</strong> are how you submit commands to a queue. Device commands are ‘recorded’ to a command buffer through Vulkan API calls, and can then be submitted once or many times (e.g.&nbsp;once every frame) to a queue to be executed.</p>
<p>That’s the TL;DR - now it’s time to dive into the details!</p>
<h2 id="genesis">Genesis</h2>
<p><strong><em>Instances and Devices</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In the beginning there was the Vulkan API. And the API was made flesh through <code>vk::Instance</code>, and from it sprung all per-application state.</em></p>
<p>You initialize Vulkan by creating an instance, which contains application state - information like what version of the Vulkan API you’re using, your application’s name, and which extensions and layers you want to enable. Extensions and layers provide behavior that isn’t included by default in Vulkan, like extended error checking and call logging.</p>
<p>With an instance you can examine the <strong>physical devices</strong> (usually GPUs) that are available. A machine might have multiple physical devices, and each of their properties (such as being a dedicated graphics card) can be inspected.</p>
<p>A common pattern for physical device selection is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all of the physical devices</li>
<li>Score each physical device on desired properties</li>
<li>Give physical devices without required properties a score of 0</li>
<li>Pick the physical device with the highest score</li>
</ul>

<p>With a physical device you can create a <strong>logical device</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical devices represent the GPU, and logical devices are what you use to create resources and access <strong>queues</strong>.</p>
<p>Keeping the logical device separate from the physical device is also useful because it allows you to have multiple logical devices, each with their state and resources, for a single physical device. One example of where this would be useful is if you had a Vulkan rendering application that also used a UI Toolkit (also running on Vulkan) that was completely separate. They’d each need their own logical devices to operate, but they’re both using the same physical device.</p>
<p>Logical device creation is also where you create queues.</p>
<h2 id="making-stuff-happen">Making Stuff Happen</h2>
<p><strong><em>Queues, Command Buffers, and Render Passes</em></strong></p>
<p>A queue is a list of commands that the GPU executes.</p>
<p>Each queue can only have certain types of commands (some can have multiple types, others just one), and this is specified when a queue is created.</p>
<p>The four types of queue operations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> —&gt; Drawing the vertices of a model</li>
<li><strong>Compute</strong> —&gt; Ray tracing, cloth simulation</li>
<li><strong>Transfer</strong> —&gt; Loading textures and buffers</li>
<li><strong>Sparse</strong> —&gt; Loading part of a ‘mega-texture’</li>
</ul>
<p>A physical device will give you access to several queues of different <strong>queue families</strong>, and when you create a queue it will be an index to a queue of a matching queue family on the device. Queue families are queues that have the same properties as one another (e.g.&nbsp;perform both graphics and compute operations).</p>
<p>Commands are submitted to queues by first recording a series of commands into a command buffer and then submitting the entire command buffer to a queue with <code>vk::Queue::submit()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: Ideally you should reuse command buffers, but generally you can re-record them every frame without a large performance hit, and it makes some things easier (e.g.&nbsp;sending uniform buffers to shaders).</p>
<p>Also, you can submit multiple command buffers to a single queue. One reason why this is useful is that it <em>can</em> allow you to ensure that one set of commands from a command buffer completes execution before another command buffer in the queue starts (more on this later).</p>
<p>Finally, commands recorded in command buffers can perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> —&gt; draw, dispatch, clear, copy, query operations etc</li>
<li><strong>State setting</strong> —&gt; bind pipelines / buffers, push constants etc</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong> —&gt; set / wait events, pipeline barriers etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Some commands perform just one of these tasks, while others do several. A <strong>render pass</strong> is needed to execute certain commands, including drawing.</p>
<h3 id="render-passes">Render Passes</h3>
<p>A render pass consists of one or more <strong>subpasses</strong>, along with several <strong>framebuffers</strong>. Framebuffers represent a series of memory attachments (e.g.&nbsp;color, depth etc) that each subpass can read from and write to.</p>
<p>A command in a subpass might write to a color buffer, which will allow for later subpasses / render passes to read from it. This allows for techniques like deferred rendering.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/deferred_g_buffer.png" alt=""><figcaption>Color attachments after initial render pass in deferred rendering (LearnOpenGL)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Deferred rendering is a story for another day, but the gist of it is that you can store most of the geometry information in an initial render pass, and <em>defer</em> expensive rendering operations like lighting for later.</p>
<details>
<summary><b> Example code for recording to a command buffer and render pass </b></summary>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>// Create a command buffer</span></span>

<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>cmd.beginRenderPass(vk::RenderPassBeginInfo());</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a><span>// Bind a graphics pipeline (covered later)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a>cmd.bindPipeline(vk::PipelineBindPoint::eGraphics, graphicsPipeline);</span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a><span>// Bind vertex buffers containing info needed to draw vertices</span></span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a href="#cb2-12"></a>cmd.bindVertexBuffers(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, vertexBuffers, offsets);</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a href="#cb2-13"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-14"><a href="#cb2-14"></a><span>// Draw the buffer currently bound to this command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-15"><a href="#cb2-15"></a>cmd.draw(vertices.size(), <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span>);</span>
<span id="cb2-16"><a href="#cb2-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-17"><a href="#cb2-17"></a><span>// Stop recording to the render pass and command buffer</span></span>
<span id="cb2-18"><a href="#cb2-18"></a>cmd.endRenderPass();</span>
<span id="cb2-19"><a href="#cb2-19"></a>cmd.end();</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>Last thing! Some commands that perform actions (e.g.&nbsp;draw vertices) do so based on the current state (e.g.&nbsp;the currently bound array of vertices) set by commands since the start of the command buffer. This means that in the above code example, <code>cmd.draw()</code> will operate on the current state set by <code>cmd.bindVertex()</code> in the previous line. This “synchronization guarantee”, that one command will finish executing before the next one starts, is usually not true.</p>
<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>
<p>GPUs are optimized for operation throughput, and because of this (with a few exceptions) <strong><em>commands are not executed in the order they were recorded in.</em></strong> The first command that performs an action in a command buffer isn’t guaranteed to finish executing before the last action command in that buffer. The first command buffer submitted to a queue won’t necessarily finish any commands before a later command buffer starts. The same thing applies to command buffers submitted on different queues and multiple subpasses.</p>
<p>At places the Vulkan spec is confusing on this topic, but the TL;DR is that this is true unless a <strong>synchronization object</strong> is used (or with state setting commands within a single command buffer).</p>
<p>There are a few different types of synchronization objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fences</strong> (GPU to CPU sync) —&gt; EX: ensure there are only two rendered frames at a time in the swap chain (i.e.&nbsp;double buffering)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semaphores</strong> (GPU to GPU sync across queues) —&gt; EX: wait for frame to finish rendering before presenting it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barriers</strong> (Sync within a command buffer / pipeline) –&gt; EX: start compute shader execution as soon as the vertex shader is finished</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subpass Dependencies</strong> (Sync between subpasses) –&gt; EX: wait for the normal and albedo attachments to complete before starting the lighting rendering subpass.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronization is closely tied to the <strong>graphics pipeline.</strong></p>

        <p>With the unveiling of iOS 14 following WWDC 2020, Apple has again updated its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml?changes=latest_minor">Core ML framework</a> with even richer interfaces for training, running, and fine-tuning machine learning models on users’ devices. Among these improvements, neural network models can now  support <a href="https://lukereichold.com/blog/posts/3d-mnist-swift-for-tensorflow/#3d-convolutional-networks">3D convolutional and pooling layers</a>, which are the backbone of many popular video classification models. Today, we’ll walk through <strong>how to take a pre-trained, off-the-shelf video classification model and get it running on iOS!</strong></p>
<p><em>For an incredibly thorough overview of the other new ML advances for Apple platforms introduced this year, I recommend Matthijs Hollemans’ article,  <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-apple-machine-learning-2020/">Apple machine learning in 2020: What’s new?</a></em>.</p>
<p>Requirements: Xcode 12.0 beta or later</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Follow along with <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=cJdRBFjQRYOJ"><strong>the completed Colab notebook</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit/tree/0.1.0"><strong>Swift package on Github</strong></a>.</strong></p>
<h2 id="-fetching-the-pre-trained-model">⬇ Fetching the pre-trained model</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">Inflated 3D Convnet (or I3D)</a> is an architecture created by DeepMind researchers to perform human action classification for videos. We will use the I3D model that has been pre-trained on DeepMind’s <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/kinetics">Kinetics 400 dataset</a>. That is, given a tensor containing frames of a video, this model will output probabilities that the given video belongs to any one of 400 respective action classes (e.g. “air drumming”, “making tea”, “bench pressing”, etc).</p>
<p>As this is a TensorFlow model, our goal is to convert it to an <code>MLModel</code> that can be consumed natively on Apple platforms. To get started, we’ll open up <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Cr8w_T53bPLHPvLfZteAxHhtjgBS-LH#scrollTo=gTW3l22wUdHD">a new Colab notebook</a> and import <a href="https://github.com/apple/coremltools"><code>coremltools</code></a>, Apple’s Python library for model conversion, editing, and validation.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>!</span>pip install coremltools<span>==</span><span>4.0</span>b1
<span>import</span> coremltools <span>as</span> ct
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll fetch the <code>kinetics-i3d</code> repo and run the included sample evaluation script which loads the pre-rained RGB video classification model, performs an inference on a sample video (so we know that it’s working), and then exports the frozen TensorFlow model as <code>frozen_model.pb</code>.</p>

<span>!</span>python evaluate_sample<span>.</span>py <span>-</span><span>-</span>eval_type rgb
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we’ll grab the class labels from the repo, where each of the 400 strings corresponds to a potential action in a video.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>with</span> open(<span></span><span>"</span><span>data/label_map.txt</span><span>"</span>) <span>as</span> f:
  class_labels <span>=</span> f<span>.</span>read()<span>.</span>splitlines()

  <span>assert</span> len(class_labels) <span>==</span> <span>400</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="-converting-the-frozen-model-to-core-ml">📲 Converting the frozen model to Core ML</h2>
<p>Finally, we’ll use the <code>coremltools</code> package to convert our frozen TensorFlow model to an <code>mlmodel</code> that can be directly consumed by iOS and macOS applications.</p>
<p>The model expects a tensor of shape <code>(1, NUM_FRAMES, 224, 224, 3)</code>, that is, an array of RGB frames, each of size 224 x 224 and – according to the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">model’s original specification</a> — pixel values rescaled to between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>We’d like to make the number of frames dynamic, so that our model works for any video containing between, say, 25 and 300 frames. Therefore, we create a <code>TensorType</code> with a flexible shape that will be passed into the converter.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">range_input <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>TensorType(shape<span>=</span>(<span>1</span>, ct<span>.</span>RangeDim(lower_bound<span>=</span><span>25</span>, upper_bound<span>=</span><span>300</span>, default<span>=</span><span>250</span>), <span>224</span>, <span>224</span>, <span>3</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Also, to make using our classifier model easier to consume, we tell the model about our explicit class labels so that these are explicitly visible within Xcode.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">config <span>=</span> ct<span>.</span>ClassifierConfig(class_labels)

<span># This is where the magic happens:</span>

</code></pre></div><p>We can also choose to add additional metadata to our model:</p>

<h2 id="-consuming-the-model-with-visualactionkit">📦 Consuming the model with VisualActionKit</h2>
<p>As of Swift 5.3, we’re now able to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/bundling_resources_with_a_swift_package">bundle resources with a Swift package</a>, so <a href="https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit"><code>VisualActionKit</code></a> was created to leverage this new functionality by effectively acting as a convenience wrapper around our <code>kinetics_i3d.mlmodel</code>. It offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepts an <code>AVAsset</code> as input</li>
<li>Pre-processes the asset’s data into a format the model expects, including resizing each frame of the video to 224 x 224 pixels using the <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/kinetics-i3d">custom resizing strategy outlined in original I3D model repo</a>.</li>
<li>Builds an <code>MLMultiArray</code> tensor containing the asset data</li>
<li>Feeds the input tensor into our model and asynchronously returns the resulting predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install this package for use in our own apps, we add the following to our app’s <code>Package.swift</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>let</span> package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: <span>"</span><span>https://github.com/lukereichold/VisualActionKit.git</span><span>"</span>, from: <span>"</span><span>0.1.0</span><span>"</span>)
    ],
    ...
)
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can perform action classifications on any provided videos, regardless of the source or input format! Here’s some example usage:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>import</span> <span>VisualActionKit</span>

<span>let</span> url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: <span>"</span><span>writing</span><span>"</span>, withExtension: <span>"</span><span>mp4</span><span>"</span>)
<span>let</span> asset = AVAsset(url: url)

<p><strong>Outside of this specific action classification model, we can use these same steps to convert any arbitrary pre-trained model</strong> to run on Apple platforms by using <code>coremltools v4</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, different than what we did here, if we were interested in <em>training our own action classifier from scratch</em> – without touching any Python or model conversion code – we also have ability to do so now.

July 25, 2020 | https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mindfulnessquest.com/four-noble-truths-buddhism/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The four noble truths in Buddhism forms the core of the Buddha’s teachings. These are explained in the very first sermon delivered by Buddha, known as&nbsp;<em>dhammacakkappavattana sutta</em>, which in English loosely translates to, “Settings the wheel of dhamma or the truth in motion.”</p> <p>Understanding <strong>the four noble truths</strong> is a vast subject that needs a detailed and thorough explanation, and it’s impossible to cover it in a single blog post. However, the information I present here will serve as an introductory text for those who wish to understand Buddha’s teachings.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-3"></span></p><p>What differentiates Buddha’s teachings from others is that he mentions that his teachings should be understood through direct experience rather than simply believing what he says.</p><p>The experiences that he talks about can be verified through different mindfulness practices and meditations. These find mention in the texts (<em>suttas</em>) and practiced by a lot of people all across the world.</p><p>Four noble truths form the foundation of a deep-rooted philosophy that can be applied to daily practical life. The primary focus of his teachings is on the&nbsp;<em>here and now</em>. Although these teaching were delivered sometime around 500 BCE, they have stood the test of time and are still applicable today.</p><p>At first glance, you may find Buddhism to be very pessimistic, as it starts with the concept of dukkha or suffering. Dukkha is a word of the Pali language, which is a combination of two words:&nbsp;<em>du</em>&nbsp;means “hard,” and&nbsp;<em>kkha</em>&nbsp;means “to endure.”<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>Translation of dukkha in English, referred to as the suffering, is a gross oversimplification of the term. Unfortunately, there is no direct equivalent in the English language. It has a much deeper meaning, which we shall explore next.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Noble_Truth_There_is_Suffering_or_Dukkha"></span>The First Noble Truth: There is Suffering or Dukkha<span></span></h2><p>The word dukkha is much more subtle than the English word suffering. It constitutes injury, sickness, old age, mental pain, death, sorrow, grief, anguish, and more. It further includes minor frustrations such as disappointments, dissatisfactions, and irritations encountered in daily life.</p><p>It also includes even the most subtle sources of stress like:</p><ul><li>Having to work for longer hours than usual occasionally.</li><li>Not being appropriately apricated for the efforts put into a piece of work.</li><li>Not being correctly greeted by a friend or a colleague at work.</li><li>Having to give more than you receive in a relationship.</li><li>Being rudely spoken to in a demeaning tone.</li><li>Being made fun of in a covert manner.</li><li>Getting irritated standing and waiting in a queue for a cup of coffee.</li><li>Frustration when the server at the coffee shop hands you a latte instead of the cappuccino you asked.</li></ul><p>I can go on and on, but you get the idea. All of this is dukkha. Now you may argue that this is just a normal part of daily living. How can you call it dukkha or suffering? It happens to all of us, and it’s normal, right?</p><p>You may argue that the real dukkha is passing away of a loved one, or losing a job overnight, or losing all of your income because of the collapse of the economy, or getting a divorce. These are more pressing matters. And yes! You’re right. All of the above are dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But here’s what most people don’t understand. The minor frustrations and dissatisfaction that we encounter in our daily lives have a cumulative adverse effect on our psyche. It grows very slowly in a subtle manner.</p><p>While the death of a loved one hurts a lot initially, the wounds heal with time. The created void may never go, but eventually, much of it is filled up with time. However, the subtle injuries caused to our psyche go undetected in many of the cases.</p><p>Over time, these frustrations get accumulated to such an extent that one resorts to ending one’s life to escape the pain. The problem is that we have normalized ailments like stress, anxiety, and depression, as a part of daily life.</p><p>For example, you might argue that losing a job is much worse than being rudely spoken too. Now, this would depend on your personality.</p><p>But in general, I have observed that people soon forget about the hardships they face during the times of unemployment. But even after years, they still remember the incident where they were ill-treated or rudely spoken too.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Once you get a new job, you forget about the pain of losing your old job. But the incidents of offensive and demeaning behaviors go directly into your subconscious.</p><p>These get accumulated over time and create great mental suffering, and sometimes even manifest as a disease in the physical body.</p><p>Again, you may argue that one cannot escape these unpleasantries of life. And yes! You are right again. But the question is – How much do you intend to suffer these unpleasantries? What we call as ups and downs of life are merely just events. There’s nothing good or bad about them.</p><p>Yet we suffer! And still, continue to suffer.</p><p>Buddha explains that there are three kinds of dukkhas:</p><ol><li>The first is simple to understand suffering, like sickness, injury, old age, death, grief, despair, sorrow, etc. It includes both physical and mental pain. We have already covered this kind of suffering above.</li><li>There is a second kind of suffering that is caused by change. Everything is subject to change and finally comes to an end. There is no such thing as a permanency. However, the mind craves for permanency, and therefore, the suffering arises. For example, expecting secure attachments in relationships, friendships, work, etc.,  results in unhappiness.</li><li>Finally, the third kind of suffering buddha talks about is suffering due to the conditioned states. The word used for this suffering is “<em>Sankara.”</em>&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no parallel English word that can describe it. There are five conditioned states, also known as the five aggregates, or&nbsp;<em>skandhas</em>, where one is physical, and the other four are mental.</li></ol><p>Now here’s something to think. If you notice carefully, there’s a contradiction between the statement of the first noble truth and the fourth noble truth.</p><p>The first noble truth says that all in this world is suffering, while the fourth noble truth says that there is a way out of it. How can both of these statements be true?</p><p>You see, the statement of the first noble truth is not an absolute, because the dukkha is born out of ignorance or&nbsp;<em>avidya</em>. Hence, one perceives this world as dukkha. The understanding of the fourth noble truth enables us to experience the world as it is.</p><p>Now that we know what dukkha is let’s get to the next section: the origin of suffering.</p><h2><span id="The_Second_Noble_Truth_%E2%80%93_The_Origin_of_Suffering"></span>The Second Noble Truth – The Origin of Suffering<span></span></h2><p>The origin of suffering is attachment (or L<em>obha</em>) to three kinds of cravings, also known as Tanha (or Trishna in Sanskrit).</p><h3><span id="The_Kama_Tanha_Craving_for_Sensory_Pleasures"></span>The Kama Tanha: Craving for Sensory Pleasures<span></span></h3><p>This kind of craving or thirst comes with the attachment to sensory pleasures. We always seek things that excite our senses. For example, we get exciting seeing a nice car, and a strong desire to acquire it arises from within. In Buddhism, this is the beginning of dukkha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Anything that satisfies the craving of the five senses: vision, smell, hearing, taste, and touch – is Kama Tanha. The main reason behind this is that these cravings only give temporary satisfaction.</p><p>The moment you set your attention to sensory pleasure objects, that very moment marks the beginning of suffering. The problem with this kind of craving is that it is insatiable. The more you have, the more you want.</p><p>Another example would be eating your favorite food or dessert. Even after you’ve finished eating, you crave more. For some, this craving comes back after a day or two, while for others, it comes back instantly.</p><p>However, the past conditioning of the mind is so intense that we do not see anything wrong with it. A few minutes of compulsive behavior now and then, generally speaking, creates long term health consequences.</p><h3><span id="The_Bhava_Tanha_Sense_of_Wanting_To_Become_Something"></span>The Bhava Tanha: Sense of Wanting To Become Something<span></span></h3><p>Bhava Tanha is the desire to achieve permanence in some way. One example would be the desire to continue in the heavenly realms as consciousness after death. In this case, the attachment to life and existence is so high that the very thought of not existing after death scares people.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-leader-1"></span></p><p>Similarly, becoming a monk with the desire to attain enlightenment is also Bhava Tanha. Practicing meditation, chanting, reciting mantras, performing rituals in the desire to achieve the&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>&nbsp;(the freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth) is again Bhava Tanha.</p><p>It is easy to misunderstand this Tanha. For example, when I started my spiritual practice a couple of years ago, I found myself falling into this trap.</p><p>As I read more into the philosophical aspects of these scriptures, I was so impressed that I immediately started giving sermons to the people around me, even when they didn’t ask for it.</p><p>I had built such strong identifications with these philosophical ideas that I used to get upset when people showed disinterest.</p><p>But my thirst for being the “most knowledgeable” and “all-knowing” had blinded me. I was always keeping a check on how other people perceived me. And I didn’t like it when people disagreed with my ideas.</p><p>What I realized was that I had fallen into the same worldly trap once again. I was indirectly seeking recognition as a spiritual teacher. The desire to be known as the great teacher was deluding me. This desire for being recognized and praised is also Bhava Tanha.<span data-ez-name="mindfulnessquest_com-mobile-leaderboard-2"></span></p><h3><span id="The_Vibhava_Tanha_Desire_To_Get_Rid_of_Things"></span>The Vibhava Tanha: Desire To Get Rid of Things<span></span></h3><p>There is another type of Tanha that is the exact opposite of Bhava Tanha. It is known as Vibhava Tanha, that is the desire to get rid of things.</p><p>This craving generally happens when we fail in our endeavors, such as building a profitable business or attaining spiritual enlightenment. We quickly get disillusioned by the present circumstances and become opposed to it, believing it to be the root cause of our suffering.</p><p>Therefore, we create a desire to get rid of things that leads to unhappiness. For example, it is seen that people who get disillusioned with money and fame turn towards spirituality in search of solace. The problem is that they create another desire to seek peace in …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadavlev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadav Lev</a> is far from your average VP of R&amp;D</strong></h2>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/party.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Nadav, pictured left, with his dev team celebrating an FC Barcelona win in Barcelona on the Axonius company retreat.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>His first “job” writing code was in the elite Israeli military intelligence agency <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit 8200</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in function to the United States NSA, 8200 has been called&nbsp; “the foremost technical intelligence agency in the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every Israeli serves in the military after high school. Only a select few get into 8200.</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8200.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I’ve been working with Nadav for about 15 months. I knew right away he was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His brain moves fast and his speech is efficient – even when speaking with me in English which is his second language. He’s tough like you would expect from a military man. But also warm. After his team had been using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank">LinearB</a> for a few months, he would ask me <em>“do you want this feedback the Israeli way or the American way?”</em> I’m pretty sure he reserves the “Israeli way” for people he trusts so I chose to take it as a compliment 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>His approach to building elite dev teams is different too. He’s not afraid to run his own playbook.</p>







<h3><strong>“Elite” software development team defined&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Before we get into Nadav’s leadership and team building secrets, it helps to understand how he thinks about elite teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Nadav’s top 6 not-so-obvious characteristics of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>The team exhausts themselves to find the best solution to problems, not just any solution</li><li>“Automation-first” is built into the culture and day-to-day decision making of everything</li><li>Important ideas and steps get documented with a high level of quality and reverence&nbsp;</li><li>Discussions are mostly about the future, sometimes about the present, and rarely about past&nbsp;</li><li>When mistakes are made the first instinct is to create new process (not accuse)&nbsp;</li><li>They <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/how-to-introduce-data-driven-culture-to-your-dev-team/" target="_blank">align engineering metrics to business goals</a>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<figure><blockquote><p>His #1 characteristic of a great team: <strong>They make other teams around them better.&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nadav played basketball growing up. He talks about great dev teams the way basketball analysts describe great point guards. <em>“Their play and their leadership make everyone around them better.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pointgaurd.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption><em>Steph, Kemba, and Dame are three of the best.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><em>“It’s also important to look at the elite team through the eyes of the developer.”</em> Nadav said. <em>“Not everyone knows how it feels.” </em>Nadav pointed out some not-so-obvious things that feel differently about being a member of an elite dev team:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>You can be yourself and admit your mistakes freely without fear&nbsp;</li><li>It feels like everyone on the team is smarter than you – in a good way</li><li>Teammates behave the same to each other when the manager is not around</li><li>Teammates are regularly solving problems for you before you know you have one</li><li>Every time CI is not perfectly green, by the time you notice, someone is already fixing it</li></ul>







<h3><strong>Journey from top secret to top start-up</strong></h3>



<figure><p><strong>ALERT: </strong>Nadav’s story and secrets outline an actionable playbook for the following audiences:&nbsp;<br><strong>➜</strong> Developers looking for the path to get <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/" target="_blank">promoted to team lead</a><br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders getting ready to scale up their existing team<br><strong>➜</strong> Engineering leaders coming in to build a new team from scratch<br><strong>➜</strong> Dev teams looking to advance from good to great</p></figure>



<p>Today, Nadav is Vice President of Research &amp; Development for the hot security start-up <a href="https://www.axonius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axonius</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was curious about his journey to get there so I asked him about his first project in 8200. He gave me a wry smile and said <em>“<strong>classified</strong>.”</em> It involved writing code and he was by himself. That’s all he could tell me without killing me 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/folder_video2.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>It must have gone well because after that first project he got to choose what he wanted to work on next and they assigned a second person to help him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It continued like that for a while. He kept impressing his bosses with cool, top secret tech. They kept assigning more people to help him on his next project.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I started almost every team I was on but was never the formal leader. I got offers to be a team lead but I refused. <strong>I was having too much fun doing cool, hands-on shit</strong>.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Why did he keep moving from project to project? If the project went well, why not stay on to maintain it? <em>“<strong>Builders gotta build</strong>.<strong>”</strong></em>  Yes. They surely do 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav stayed with his unit for 6 years – double the required term of 3 years. During that time he met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deansysman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dean Sysman</a>. Later, when Dean was CTO of a security start-up called Cymmetria, he recruited him to join.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“The final project I started in the army eventually had 50 people working on it. I felt great about what I accomplished and I was ready for a different challenge.”</em> It was time to build something new. He joined Cymmetria as senior developer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Early on, I figured out that while we have awesome technologists, probably among the brightest in the world, <strong>no one knew how to manage development, release, and write good code. So I took charge</strong>.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? This time when Nadav was offered the role of team lead he took it. <em>“The change was minimal. I was already documenting all of our sprint processes, leading our ceremonies, our testing approach… doing it de facto.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I asked if he liked being a lead, his eyes lit up and he got closer to the camera.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/chill.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>He liked it. They raised series A funding and he scaled the dev team from 2 to 10. After three years they had built every feature on their wish list and the company was succeeding. Nadav wanted a new project and decided it was time to move on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he got in touch with Dean Sysman again who was now CEO of a new security start-up called Axonius. Dean didn’t want Nadav to be a dev or team lead. He wanted him to be his VP of R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things moved even faster this time. In the 24 months after Nadav joined, Axonius exploded:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The number of people in Axonius grew by 5X</li><li>Nadav scaled the number of people in R&amp;D by 5X</li><li>They won the <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/about/press-releases/axonius-named-most-innovative-startup-at-2019-rsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coveted RSAC most innovative start-up award</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/axonius-nabs-58m-for-its-cybersecurity-focused-network-asset-management-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They raised a whopping $95 million dollars</a> from top-tier investors&nbsp;</li></ul>







<h2><strong>7 secrets from 8200 for building elite dev teams</strong></h2>



<p>Naturally, after hearing this impressive story, I asked Nadav what he learned on the journey. Many of his fundamental beliefs for building and scaling teams trace back to his days in 8200.</p>

<h3><strong>Secret #1: Learn to lead without a mandate or official title&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Leading people without title or authority…&nbsp; Easy to say. Incredibly hard to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I had to learn to get developers to do what I think was right without formal authority over them.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>So how exactly does he do it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains indirect leadership and how it can help you build teams and get promoted.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjI5uUuV6Qw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #2: “If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Part of leading, especially when you don’t have the title, is putting in the work. <em>“Initially, at Cymmetria, I was doing my job plus creating process documents, writing training guides, building automation, helping everyone… It worked for me in the army so I did it again.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Isn’t that a lot of hours? I asked.<strong> </strong><em>“If you can’t stand the heat then don’t get into the kitchen.”</em></p>



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that was Nadav giving it to me the “Israeli way” 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav shares the truth about how much time indirect leadership takes.</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaJcEtRYdVI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #3: The smarter the person, the more “why” matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>According to Nadav <em>“It’s easier to influence average employees. They’re more likely to follow your requests on face value. Your best people are actually harder to manage because they will push back if they don’t understand why you’re asking them to do something.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Nadav explains how to manage highly intelligent people using “why”</em></strong></p>



<iframe width="560" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yH9OBaGysZ4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>







<h3><strong>Secret #4: Become great at every job yourself before you hire anyone&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><em>“I had a boss in the army tell me ‘if you want to be the best leader you can be, you must know the job of every person you work with, better than that person.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I was furious with this because it contradicted every leadership idea I knew of.”</em> I get it. I can think of about eight Harvard Business Review articles I’ve read that might disagree.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time Nadav saw the merit in this approach. Remember, your best employees will push back until they know why 🙂&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadav explains <em>“In order to work with people effectively you have to understand them completely. In order to understand them, you have to understand their job. What are their difficulties? What are they trying to achieve? How are they being measured? How do they perceive you? If you walk a mile in their shoes, you will find that understanding them becomes much easier.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now I understand. It’s not about control. It’s about empathy. It also doesn’t mean you have to DO every job better than the people that work for you. You just have to KNOW every job better. Like a coach of a basketball team. They understand what great looks like even if they never played at a high level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Nadav started at Axonius, he took this idea to the extreme, and started his tenure there in the most contrarian way I can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“My plan was to spend my first few weeks meeting everyone, learning, getting comfortable with the people. However, I realized that if I do that, I won’t have the time then to build all the processes and infrastructure we need. So I discarded my initial plan and put my heart and soul into personally building everything our team needed to succeed.”</em> </p>



<p>In two weeks he:</p>



<ul><li>Wrote 200 pages of code for an end-to-end, automated product testing mechanism</li><li>Integrated coding standard enforcement tools for consistency and shorter reviews.&nbsp;</li><li>Remodeled the Confluence knowledge base to make it easier to find stuff.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a guide instructing how to set up a new environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Configured Jira for maximum ease and transparency.&nbsp;</li><li>Wrote a 20 page training program from scratch.</li></ul>







<p>He literally told the CEO <em>“I’m going to start but please don’t put me in charge of the team yet.”</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that crazy or genius? Nadav argues it was the best thing he could have done.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tr><td>
	<div>
	<p>It's worth discussing <em>how</em> all this works so you understand the 
	challenges that are being overcome here. The ability to run multiple DOS 
	programs at once is a pretty neat trick, given that this software heralds 
	from an era of computing that was <em>just barely</em> ahead of what the 
	Apple ][ was doing in 1978. If you want to skip this, <a href="#Windows_1.0">go ahead</a>.</p>
	<p>The root of the problem is that the IBM PCs basic architecture 
	crystallized a very long time ago, in 1981. In a world where ten kilobytes of RAM counted for 
	about what a gig does now, there was not a lot of room for "overhead" and 
	the idea that you would run two programs simultaneously was generally 
	unrealistic except at the high end of the computing world, which most PC 
	buyers were nowhere near. You needed every bit (<em>ha</em>) of memory you could get, and when 
	memory became more affordable a few years later, it was too late 
	to change anything.</p>
	<p>After just a couple years on the market, MS-DOS had become the 
	unquestioned OS of choice for the PC<a href="#footnote1">*</a> 
	and developed a monumental stable of software, every bit of which<em> </em>
	was essential to someone, somewhere, and could not be easily replaced. Thus 
	began one of the longest tails in technology history, as the PC industry and 
	Microsoft began contorting themselves to try not to 
	break compatibility with old software while still moving forward with advanced 
	functionality.<br>
	<sub><a name="footnote1">*</a>(specifically, since there were MS-DOSes for 
	other architectures, and other OSes for the PC)</sub></p>
	<p>Because DOS was developed under constraints very similar to those 
	in the 
	late '70s that gave us the "bitty boxes" (C64, Apple ][, ZX 
	Spectrum, etc.) it was not built with any kind of "supervision" in mind. In 
	other words, there was no abstraction level above the current running program. 
	DOS was more like a set of tools than what we think 
	of as an operating system now - specifically, it had no "process management"; no concept of "processes" at all, in fact.</p>
	<h2><strong>DOS</strong></h2>
	<p>When the machine booted, the part of DOS that was considered "the OS" - 
	the code for accessing disk drives, writing text to screen, etc. - was copied 
	into memory, and then execution was handed off to the command interpreter, COMMAND.COM, 
	which was an application like any other, at which point you could begin 
	entering commands to use the computer.</p>
		<p>At this point, DOS was no longer "running" in 
	any meaningful way. The code was "resident," meaning it was present in the 
		computer's memory, but 
	the processor wasn't&nbsp; executing any of it. Instead, the CPU was busy executing 
	whatever the current program was - if you were at the command prompt, then 
		all the code the PC was executing was part of COMMAND.COM. When you launched another application, COMMAND.COM was 
	vacated and replaced by that other application.</p>
	<p>In other words, while an application was running, DOS was almost totally out of 
	the picture. The only time execution returned to DOS itself was when the 
	application requested a "service" from DOS, like accessing a disk drive, at 
	which point it would tell the CPU to go execute one of DOS' stored routines 
	for this, and when that routine was done, control would return to the 
	application. This meant that,<em> generally speaking</em>,<em> </em>the current 
	program 
	had absolute control of the PCs execution and it's memory. It could in fact choose to 
	overwrite DOS itself, obliterating it out of memory, and DOS couldn't do a damn thing about it.</p>
	<p>The currently running app also had the option to speak directly to hardware. 
	The 
	whole purpose of DOS was to abstract things like that so programs wouldn't 
	need to know the details of the system they were running on, but since the 
	IBM PC was <em>extremely</em> consistent hardware-wise in its early 
	incarnations, it was entirely 
	optional for developers to take advantage of that, and often 
	there were reasons - of performance, perhaps - to bypass DOS and do things 
	directly.</p>
		<p>DOS provided disk access routines, 
	but the app could blow right by them and shoot commands straight to the 
	floppy drive if it wanted. DOS provided routines for printing text and clearing the 
	screen, but the app could just write directly to video memory. I can't speak to how common this kind of behavior actually was, but it 
	certainly wasn't rare, and it speaks to a larger problem - DOS apps simply 
	expect total control over the system.</p>
		<p>If you run two DOS apps at once, they're 
	going to stomp on each other, because each one thinks it's in charge of the 
		whole machine. The first one would store data in the same spot that the 
		second one stored program code, and thus one would overwrite the other 
		and crash it. So DOS was a single-tasking operating system - you could 
		run one program at a time, and when you wanted to run another, you had 
		to exit, return to the command prompt, and then launch your other app.</p>
		<p>Consequently, if you were working on something 
	in Microsoft Multiplan and wanted to go look up some data in dBase, you had to quit completely 
	out of Multiplan and then start dBase, which would take over the system and totally 
	overwrite the previous app. To get back to where you were you'd have to exit 
		dBase, restart Multiplan, load your document and find your place again - 
		in the process, totally forgetting what you were there to do in the 
		first place, because it's so many steps and takes so long.</p>
	<p>Right from the get-go, PC users wanted to be able to look at one program, then rapidly 
	switch to another. On its face this seems to mean "run two programs at once," 
	which is what we do now, but that's not quite the full story. Let's touch on how 
	that works nowadays, however.</p>
	<h2><strong>Multiprocessing</strong></h2>
	<p>To be clear, you <em>cannot</em> run two programs "at once" on a 
	computer. Some would call this semantics, but it's important in a very real 
	way, <em>especially</em> when talking about 80s-era PCs.</p>
		<p>Modern multicore CPUs get very close to true parallel processing by 
		letting separate programs run on separate cores, but of course, nobody has a CPU so big 
	that they have one core per process. And even if you did, programs still 
		have to share other 
	resources - the system bus, hard drives, and so on. Access to these 
	resources has to be carefully managed so that only one application can use 
		them at a time, and each one has to be cleaned up after before another 
		one can use the same resources. Otherwise, one program could leave the 
		hardware in a state where the commands that the next program sends put 
		it in an unusable state and crash the machine, or corrupt data.</p>
	<p>Even with all our modern pipelined cleverness, you have the 
	fundamental problem that a CPU, and a computer in general, has a limited 
	amount of physical hardware and can't dedicate some to each individual 
	program that's running. When you have more processes running than you have silicon, the only option left is to share 
	resources by dividing up the amount of time that each process gets to use the hardware 
	- this is one of the oldest concepts in computing, and goes back to the late '50s.</p>
	<p>The fundamentals of this process are simple: At 
	any given moment, one program has near-total control of the entire 
	system, to execute its code and use all the resources, and then after it 
	executes for a bit, it goes into a paused state and control is handed off to 
	the next program, which does its work and then hands off to the next. This 
	continues in a round-robin fashion, so that every program gets to use the 
	hardware for a certain portion of every second.</p>
	<p>Modern implementations take this to a fever pitch with all the complex 
	machinations used to make this process efficient, but the fundamentals have 
	never changed; this is how your PC is operating right now.</p>
	<p>One big hurdle to overcome in implementing this is that programs don't just execute 
	instructions in a vacuum. As code is executed, there are side 
	effects. Some are values internal to the CPU, like the&nbsp; status of CPU registers and the current 
	position of the instruction pointer. This is called "CPU state," amd is specific to 
	each running program. When you switch from one program to another, you have to 
	save that information - called "context switching" - and restore it when you 
	come back. Storing this info takes extra time and memory.</p>
		<p>Another hurdle is the state of other hardware. If two programs are 
		talking to the hard drive, you can't let them both just blindly issue 
		commands every time they get control of the CPU. The first process might 
		start a data read that the second process interrupts with a data write, 
		confusing the hard drive controller. So when switching from one process 
		to another, you also have to save the state of these other hardware 
		resources - and possibly even delay switching tasks until those hardware 
		requests are complete.</p>
	<p>If you have enough RAM to store this state, and if your apps don't need too many cycles per second to appear responsive, you can do all this and the user 
	will feel like they're "running multiple programs at 
	once."</p>
	<p>Now, in business applications - the 
	driving force behind the first couple decades of computing - actual 
	"multiprocessing" of this type is not as important as simple usability - users 
	just don't want to have to close one program in order to open another, as they 
	did throughout the DOS days. That, ultimately, is the goal: it 
	doesn't matter if the computer is perfectly speedy, or if programs can run 
	simultaneously, it just matters that 
	users not have to lose all their work in one program simply in order to look 
	at another.</p>
	<h2>Multitasking</h2>
	<p>This desire was of course tremendous right from the start of computing. Who wants to 
	be stuck in one program at a time? So, almost from the 
	earliest days of the IBM PC, software was created to enable task switching 
	with various degrees of success.</p>

When programming for full operating
systems, like any desktop, mobile, or higher-end embedded platforms, the answer is easy—threads.
They're built into the OS, and you typically <em>have</em> to use them to take advantage of features like
multiple CPU cores. Or, when programming for an embedded target, you may reach for a lightweight
<abbr title="Real-Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> like <a href="https://freertos.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FreeRTOS</a>, which gives you full threads without much work.</p>
<p>But what if you have a 16MHz microcontroller with 2 KB of RAM?</p>
<p>The Arduino Uno is known for being ubiquitous, cheap, and easy to program. Although there are more
and more reasons to use competing products, such as the various ARM Cortex-M and Espressif boards
(which I use almost exclusively), the Microchip (formerly Atmel) ATMega series is sometimes still
preferred for low power applications, cutting cents off a <abbr title="Bill of Materials">BOM</abbr>, and its widespread support.</p>
<p>Typically, one checks in a loop repeatedly to see if the task is ready to activate. This can be
checking if there's data in a serial buffer, if a certain time period has passed, or a <abbr title="General-Purpose Input/Output">GPIO</abbr> pin has
toggled. However, I'm going to present an alternative to doing this—<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>Many modern languages are implementing <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. C# was one of the first big languages to do
it, and then Python, JavaScript, Dart, Kotlin quickly followed. The big difference between threads
and <code>async</code> functions is that <code>async</code>hronous code is handled by the program itself, usually
cooperatively, while synchronous operations on threads rely on the OS to do it. The first obvious
reason for it, then, is when threads aren't available—just like what we're about to get into soon.
However, asynchronous code is typically faster than synchronous code because it is able to avoid the
overhead of spawning threads and context switches, as well as the memory overhead, as the amount of
space needed on the stack can be calculated ahead of time.</p>
<p>Internally, the compiler turns the code into a state machine, typically using the language's
generators feature if it has one. Here, every time you write <code>.await</code> and the data is not available
immediately, the compiler inserts a <code>return</code> statement, and adds a parameter that allows you to jump
right back to where it was. Rust uses <code>Pin</code>ning, where it is guaranteed that the generated struct
that holds the stack will always be in the same place in memory at all times. This avoids a problem
where a pointer is taken to a local variable, the function returns and comes back, and is suddenly
pointing to something completely different.</p>

<p>C++20 has similar features to Rust's <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with the <code>co_await</code> keyword, although the
<a href="https://blog.panicsoftware.com/co_awaiting-coroutines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available documentation</a> is <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/02_execution/04_executor.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">not quite as good as Rust's</a>.
However, there's a total of... <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/search?q=%22co_await%22&amp;tab=forum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1 search result</a> on the Arduino forums, <em>and</em> it's
in German with no code. And even if there <em>was</em> code, it would be largely unaccessable as Arduino
ships with an old compiler:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avr-gcc/*/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>GCC<span>)</span> <span>7.3</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2017</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>GCC 7.3.0 ships with <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">"almost full support"</a> for C++17 (although not by default), but a
total of 0 C++20 additions. And if you're on PlatformIO, you'll have even less luck:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❱ ~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-atmelavr/bin/avr-gcc --version
avr-gcc <span>(</span>AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.6.2_1759<span>)</span> <span>5.4</span>.0
Copyright <span>(</span>C<span>)</span> <span>2015</span> Free Software Foundation, Inc.</code></pre></div>
<p>However, Rust has been able to compile <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> code for <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">almost a year now on the <em>stable
compiler build</em></a>. There's been steadily increasing interest in using these
features on embedded platforms with Rust, and many projects have been using it as a result.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-asyncawait">Pseudo-<code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h2>
<p>These libraries actually implement a <em>very</em> similar thing to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> with a state machine,
and jumping to different positions in code based on where it's already been. For example,
<a href="https://github.com/bxparks/AceRoutine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceRoutine</a> has a macro, <code>COROUTINE</code>, that internally converts the function into a state machine
that jumps to different places using <code>goto</code>. This is actually almost identical to how tools like
Babel in the JavaScript world convert <code>async</code> functions to traditional functions that can be used
with old browsers.</p>
<p>However, there are a few very critical problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local variables are not preserved across yields</strong>.</li>
<li>You can't use certain statements in some libraries (not AceRoutine), such as <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>Destructors don't run properly, and will <strong><code>free</code> uninitialized memory</strong> if not done correctly
(due to the first point).</li>
<li>Tasks can't return values.</li>
</ul>
<p>These limitations are because simple preprocessor macros, which is the only option in C/C++, are
only "glorified copy-paste", and have no real computing power. Although <code>async</code> is built into the
Rust compiler, it wasn't before, and a (less-than-ideal, but still usable) macro could implement
most of the feature itself. Hopefully, new C++20 features will lead to more use in the embedded
world.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>It looks like there's a few packages (known as "crates" in the Rust world) to interface with the
hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a>, which only supports the Arduino Uno</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-device</a>, which provides low-level hardware control</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>, which provides higher-level board and <abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr> support, and depends on avr-device</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/avr-rust/ruduino" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ruduino</a> is by the avr-rust team that worked on getting Rust working on AVR, I ultimately
decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avr-hal</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports many more boards, and has a structure that allows it to expand further</li>
<li>
<p>It supports <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a>, which allows us to share code between boards: for example, the
<a href="https://docs.rs/apa102-spi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>apa102_spi</code></a> crate will let us control APA102 LED strips on an Arduino Uno and a Raspberry Pi
running Linux, using the exact same code!</p>
<ul>
<li>embedded-hal also has a bigger focus on nonblocking operations, which is exactly what we're
looking for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has a cleaner and safer API</li>
</ul>
<p>To set that up:</p>
<p><strong>(Update 2020-07-26)</strong>: this is much simpler now with the latest nightly. All that is required:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>rustup <span>install</span> nightly
rustup +nightly component <span>add</span> rust-src</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-and-running">Compiling and Running</h2>
<p>We can compile by running</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>cargo +nightly build -Z build-std<span>=</span>core --release --target avr-atmega328p.json

cargo +nightly build --release</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, to upload it to a device, assuming that you have <code>avrdude</code> installed, run:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>avrdude -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the upload path (<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/serial.elf</code>) to meet what you want
to upload.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-only-have-the-arduino-ide-installed">If you only have the Arduino IDE installed</h2>
<p>Enable "Show verbose output during: upload" in the Arduino IDE. Observe the build logs for an
<code>avrdude</code> command—it should look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:/tmp/arduino_build_721874/Blink.ino.hex:i</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy that command, but delete everything after <code>-Uflash:w:</code>. Then, without spaces, add the path to
your binary. This will typically be <code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf</code>, or
<code>target/avr-atmega328p/release/examples/example_name.elf</code>. Finally, add <code>:e</code>. Your final command
will probably look something like:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/bin/avrdude -C/path/to/.arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/avrdude/6.3.0-arduino17/etc/avrdude.conf -v -patmega328p -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:target/avr-atmega328p/release/project_name.elf:e</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="what-about-converting-to-hex-first">What about converting to hex first?</h3>
<p>Arduino typically converts the compiled binary to raw hex, and many AVR-Rust projects have
<a href="https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal/blob/bfc5dfe67107a68b4a673e54532354af126cb3ba/mkhex.sh#L32" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">followed that pattern</a>. However, there's generally no need to do that, as <code>avrdude</code>
has the ability to upload ELF binaries directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="onto-async-operations">Onto <code>async</code> operations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/0.2.*/embedded_hal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">embedded-hal</a> is implemented in such a way that asynchronous operations is
quite easy. When you attempt to read or write a value, you can get three results:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WouldBlock</code>: I can't complete this operation right now.</li>
<li><code>Ok</code>: The operation succeeded. If reading something, this gives you the read value.</li>
<li><code>Err</code>: An error occurred while performing this operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This maps very nicely to Rust's <code>Future</code> trait, which is used to implement asynchronous code. For
example, reading from a serial port is implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>poll_read</span><span>(</span>
    <span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>:</span> Pin<span>&lt;</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>Self</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>

<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Poll<span>&lt;</span>Result<span>&lt;</span>usize<span>,</span> T<span>::</span>Error<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>match</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>byte<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>*</span>ptr <span>=</span> byte<span>;</span>
                Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span>WouldBlock<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span>Pending<span>,</span>
            <span>Err</span><span>(</span>nb<span>::</span>Error<span>::</span><span>Other</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        Poll<span>::</span><span>Ready</span><span>(</span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although there's a bit of weirdness in terms of checking if the buffer is big enough, for the most
part, this works pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="why-do-i-always-return-1-byte-read">Why do I always return 1 byte read?</h3>
<p>I'm mostly mirroring the <code>AsyncRead</code> and <code>AsyncWrite</code> in the <code>futures</code> crate, which typically is
used on machines with full operating systems. Typically, the overhead of a syscall is somewhat
high, so you might request e.g. 1024 bytes at a time. Obviously, that isn't the case for an 8-bit
<abbr title="Microcontroller">MCU</abbr>. However, I'm keeping that pattern for ease of porting and to allow for networking, e.g. the
Arduino Ethernet shield.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I copied and pasted the <code>AsyncReadExt</code> and <code>AsyncWriteExt</code> traits from the <code>futures</code> crate as
well. The way this is set up is that you just implement the low-level functions, and the <code>Ext</code>
traits take care of the more user-friendly functions. This is done instead of default
implementations to allow the main trait to be small in case it is added to the standard library,
much like how <code>Future</code> is in <code>std</code>/…</p></div></div>

July 25, 2020 | https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://chris124567.github.io/2020-07-25-analysis-commercial-fingerprinting-service/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190503172035/https://www.augur.io/">Augur</a> (2013-2017) was a commercial browser fingerprinting service, offered primarily to AdTech companies.  In this post I will analyze their tracking script and describe how it works and what information it collects.  The original copy of the script (<a href="https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>) is no longer up; however, the Internet Archive still has a copy at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js">https://web.archive.org/web/20170609184536js_/https://cdn.augur.io/augur.min.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deobfuscating">Deobfuscating</h2>
<p>A first glance at the script shows a bunch of seemingly random characters (including emojis).  The was a hint to me that they were probably passing a big string into some deobfuscation function and <code>eval</code>ing it.  Passing the script through <a href="https://beautifier.io/">beautifier.io</a> shows exactly that.  The deobfuscation function has the following contents:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        ...
        if (!''.replace(_(12), String)) {
            var z = {};
            for (i = 0; i &lt; 686; i++) {
                var y = x(i);
                z[y] = r[i] || y
            }
            t = _(15);
            y = function(a) {
                return z[a] || a
            };
            o = o.replace(t, y)
        } else {
            for (j = a[a.length - 1] - 1; j &gt;= 0; j--) {
                (r[j]) ? o = o.replace(new RegExp('\b' + (j &lt; 63 ? c.charAt(j) : c.charAt((j - 63) / 63) + c.charAt((j - 63) % 63)) + '\b', '\x67'), r[j]): 0
            }
        }
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the deobfuscated output, we can just copy the return statement but replace <code>return</code> with <code>console.log</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        console.log(o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\""));
        return o.replace(_(11), "\n").replace(_(16), "\"")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can just run the script in our browsers developer console and copy-paste the large output. The deobfuscated version can be found at <a href="https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu">https://pastebin.com/5Gdgxkxu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fingerprinted-attributes">Fingerprinted Attributes</h2>
<p>We will now look at the attributes collected by the script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>* Cookie enabled status - navigator.cookieEnabled
* User agent - navigator.userAgent
* Emails in input forms - all non-hidden or blurred inputs are checked with a Regex for emails which are then associated with a Device ID
* If the site is using the Facebook SDK (window.FB is defined), call window.FB.api("/me") and return username and email.
* Do Not Track status - navigator.doNotTrack || navigator.msDoNotTrack
* Audio information - Creating a new HTML5 AudioContext and getting its sampleRate, maxChannelCount, numberOfInputs, numberOfOutputs, channelCount, channelCountMode, channelInterpretation
* Timezone - Creating a new Date object and calling getTimezoneOffset()
* Adblock status - Creating a new element with class "adsbox," adding some text to it, appending it to the body, and checking that its height equals 0 (if yes, then an adblocker is enabled)
* Canvas fingerprinting - Creating a new Canvas, drawing "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/" over it in multiple different colors with a rainbow background, then using the toDataURL function to get the base64 PNG representation
* Private Browser Mode detection - Trying to write data using localStorage, indexedDB, or requestFileSystem
* Font detection - Getting the width/height of the browser "fallback" (default) serif, sans-serif, and monospaces fonts, then measuring the width of a bunch of fonts (Augur's list has over 800) and seeing if there is any differences between the tested font and the defaults
* Media devices (speakers, cameras, microphones) enumeration - navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices
* Installed plugins enumeration - navigator.plugins
* Spoofing detection
    * Browser build number (always 20030107 on Chrome/Safari) - navigator.productSub
    * toString length of eval (33 on Chrome, 37 on Firefox/Safari, 39 on Internet Explorer) - eval.toString().length
    * Error toSource support (Firefox only)
* Touch support - navigator.maxTouchPoints || navigator.msMaxTouchPoints || "ontouchstart" in window || attempting to create a TouchEvent
* Local and remote IP addresses with WebRTC STUN

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I was shocked to find that Augur was silently collecting user’s Facebook information and all emails put in forms.  Apparently, this has been reported on <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/18/no-boundaries-for-facebook-data-third-party-trackers-abuse-facebook-login/">before</a>.  Otherwise, their fingerprinting was pretty comprehensive, but did not really feature any innovative or novel techniques.</p>

That would be incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>If Nintendo really wanted to do something EPIC, all it has to do is release a video of Phil Spencer playing <i>Halo: Infinite</i>...on a Switch running xCloud.&nbsp;</p></div><p><b>BOOM!&nbsp;</b></p><p>And the crowd goes wild.</p><h3>Closing thoughts</h3><p>There is always the risk of complacency. Nintendo could decide not to do anything until September, which might be damaging. I expect Sony will release more info about the PlayStation 5 at some point, especially since we don't know the price or launch date. There might be more gameplay footage to come. Microsoft might have a busy August if they announce the Xbox Series S/Project Lockhart then. Nintendo could make a splash by announcing <i>Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 </i>on the Switch or S<i>uper Mario Sunshine Remastered. </i>That would guarantee a lot of interest and pre-orders.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think? Is Nintendo on the right track or should it do more to get everyone talking about the Switch and their games?</p><h2>If you liked reading this post, please check out some of my others</h2>
