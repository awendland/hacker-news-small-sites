<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was reading the Slate Star Codex <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart">review</a> of The Cult of Smart. Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I donâ€™t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p>
<p>I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 âˆ’ 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also werenâ€™t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p>
<p>There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldnâ€™t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldnâ€™t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didnâ€™t realize anything unusual was happening.</p>
<p>Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. Theyâ€™re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p>
<ul><li><p>The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldnâ€™t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p></li><li><p>All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.
Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isnâ€™t surprising. If teachersâ€™ promotions and managementâ€™s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But itâ€™s still sad.</p></li></ul>
<p>Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/â€‹expels a student, thereâ€™s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, donâ€™t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p>
<p>I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasnâ€™t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. Heâ€™s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were â€œI learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazingâ€�. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/â€‹upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friendsâ€™ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what Iâ€™ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what my point here is. I think I have two:</p>
<ul><li><p>Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasnâ€™t also the case in the US.</p></li><li><p>I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. Itâ€™s just good to remember that itâ€™s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p></li></ul>

        <h4>20 Feb 2021</h4>
        <p><a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Tools/">Tools</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Rant/">Rant</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/DevOps/">DevOps</a></p><p>
        TL;DR: Proposal for a way to define multiple-machine systems in a immutable way, without requiring by-hand layouts.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading a lot about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops#nixops">NixOps</a> recently, and although I’m still leaning towards <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> overall as my system configurator of choice (technically <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, but that’s not so relevant for this), I’ve realised there’s a gap in the market for better immutable infrastructure. Note that this is a half-formed proposal, not a plan to do things, as I’ve already got way too many things on my plate, but I felt it was worth sharing the idea with others if anyone feels like picking this up, or doing something derived from it.</p>
<p>The goal is as follows: I want to be able to declare things like “I want X replicas of this service running, on different nodes” and “don’t put too many things on one node so the load gets well shared”, while not having to layout by hand <em>which</em> nodes the services go on, as they’re <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">cattle not pets</a>. We can do this with Kubernetes right now, but at the cost of a system that tends towards being hard to debug when things go wrong, and things can <a href="https://k8s.af/">go very wrong</a>. It also has the limit that you have to containerise everything and isn’t really suited to managing local node setups (i.e. everything you need installed before you run the Kubernetes agent, like say ntp).</p>
<p>Nix OTOH, is absolutely designed for the local node setup, and NixOps would let us then setup multiple machines. However, NixOps is designed towards a “here’s a set of Nix expressions defining a series of specific machines”, and isn’t designed for any of the “choose where stuff goes for me” bits. These machines aren’t full-blown pets as they’re still automatically configured, but they’re not really fully cattle either.</p>
<p>We need a 3rd option: something with the best bits of both. Maybe it can be done with a variant of NixOps that defines a “basic node” config (stuff you want everywhere, like a specific kernel, ntp, maybe some firewall stuff), and then a series of “service” configs, that probably contain <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243920">an actual service config</a> and maybe any other packages/config that service needs, along with some metadata (e.g. replication count, memory/CPU requirements). It does need some sort of thing that decides “where does that particular service go” especially if the node that was carrying it goes down. Maybe we have some little service running on each node with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus</a> to decide what goes where, but all compiling down to Nix configurations for ease of debugging. It would also need to be able to cope with the upgrade case, plausibly by using the consensus system to replace a subset at a time of the services (or maybe some magic with unique names for services so we can run old version + new version at the same time)</p>
<p>Ideally, we also have something that lets us say spit out <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> config for the more infrastructure things (NixOps supports AWS, Hetzner and GCE; Terraform supports <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">basically everything</a> and so it’s just easier that way), and then we can have a single config language that defines everything about our system’s setup other than the source code. And without needing to write <a href="https://octopus.com/blog/introduction-to-hcl-and-hcl-tooling">HCL</a>!</p>
<p>I would also note that I don’t regard Nix as the definitive option on system config languages. I think the immutable infrastructure approach is great, but the Nix language <a href="https://davedellacosta.com/posts/2019-03-29-why-nixos-is-hard-and-how-to-fix.html#what-is-so-hard">is kinda awful</a>. I’m somewhat more fond of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, but I’ve used Nix here as the example as it’s the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla">800-pound gorilla</a> in this space currently. I’m not sure what “better” looks like, other than liking the approach of using an existing language (as Guix does with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Scheme</a>) rather than building half of one along the way like Nix does.</p>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

<p>We are probably all familiar with "555" telephone numbers. The basic idea is
that the 555 exchange code (or NXX in a NANP NXX-XXXX number) is reserved for
use in fiction. Of course, this isn't actually true at all, but that hasn't
stopped basically every work of fiction putting their imaginary telephone
numbers in the 555 exchange.</p>
<p>In reality, the 555 exchange has a somewhat bumpy history, as is the case with
most "special purpose" telephone ranges. Seemingly from the genesis of NANP as
a formal numbering standard, the 555 exchange was reserved for special use by
telcos, and was not to be used for normal subscriber lines. The 555 exchange
accumulated various and sundry uses, but most prominently, starting in the
early '60s it was used for directory service at 555-1212 in nearly all NPAs
(area codes). This was nearly the only successful use of the 555 exchange,
leaving it mostly empty.</p>
<p>Because the 555 exchange was conveniently largely out of use, it became common
for the entertainment industry to use 555 numbers in fiction. Wikipedia makes
the claim that the telephone industry had specifically recommended 555 numbers
for this use in the '60s, and while this is rather thinly sourced, it's not
hard to believe as any odd person in a technical role at a telephone company
might have suggested 555 as an exchange with extremely few assigned numbers.</p>
<p>In any case, the use of 555 numbers for fiction was somewhat informal. This
changed in 1994, when the telephone industry regretted leaving an entire
exchange out of use and formed a working group which allowed 555 numbers to
be assigned to nationwide communications services. The idea was that 555
numbers would have the unusual property of working nationwide when dialed as
only seven digits, somewhat like an early version of SMS short codes.</p>
<p>Because the use of 555 numbers in fiction was longstanding, the working group
explicitly reserved numbers starting 555-01 for use in fiction. This, in 1994,
is when this practice became formalized---but only for those 100 numbers.</p>
<p>In practice the 555 service as imagined was unsuccessful, and in the 2010s the
use was eliminated more or less by handshake agreement. Much like the pre-1994
state, the only valid phone numbers in the 555 exchange are 555-1212 for
directory assistance, and 555-4334. This latter number is apparently still
assigned for a nationwide use but no one specifies <em>what</em> use.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging, and... came up empty. 555-4334 in a number of area
codes turns up nothing from the CNAM service I use. Similar attempts with
a couple of validation/carrier lookup vendors returned different types of
useless results. I haven't found any mention of the number in old newspapers,
with the interesting exception of some newspapers listing their classified
ads with exclusively 555 numbers, including 4334.</p>
<p>It was not an unusual practice at the time for newspapers to provide special
"voice mail box" numbers for classified ads, but to my knowledge the use of 555
was not typical.  The first newspapers to do so were almost all in Utah, which
hints that it may have originated as a choice by a local telco, potentially
Mountain Bell but maybe more likely an independent. I will do some more digging
into this over time. It's interesting in that it suggests a major use of 555
numbers which no document I've seen on the history of the exchange mentions.
This practice doesn't seem to have been eliminated until the 1994 reallocation.</p>
<p>I also learned that in 2009 you could get a rebate of $7,555 or $4,334 on a new
Dodge Nitro. Isn't OCR fun?</p>
<p>Finally, I located an older FCC report (dated 1997) that lists 555-4334 as
allocated to MCI mail, an early e-mail service. MCI mail access was initially
by modem, and so it's possible that 555-4334 was used as an access number,
although an 800 number was also provided for this purpose and 4334 is not
mentioned anywhere I can find as an access number. An interesting feature of
MCI Mail was its ability to forwarded email to postal addresses (by printing and
mailing it) or by fax or teletype, so I speculate that 555-4334 may have been
used as a return number for TTY messages, since the TTY integration was
apparently bidirectional. In any case, another document noted that 555-4334 was
permitted to remain in service until that service ended, which may have been an
allowance due to the fact that MCI was a telephone carrier (and thus had
greater sway over the working group) and that replacing the number may have
been technically difficult.</p>
<p>Today, it remains the case that only 555-01xx is properly allocated for
fictional use. However, the 555 exchange as a whole is as dead (or considering
the use by newspapers, much  more dead) than ever before, so it remains common
to use the entire 555 exchange in fiction.</p>
<p>Oddly, the 555 NPA (rather than exchange) is allocated for similar
applications, but as far as I can tell it is not in use.</p>
<p>The failure of the post-1994 use of 555 for a "short dialing service" reflects
a larger series of telco failures that has left some other special prefixes.
In the '90s, a great deal of attention was directed towards "non-geographic"
dialing. Because the telephone system connected the nation together, why not
have a method of telephone dialing which is independent of geography? Well, as
it turns out, there are several reasons, but this didn't stop anyone from
trying.</p>
<p>Although there were a hodgepodge of other attempts, the first major
non-geographic dialing scheme is contained in the special 700 NPA (area code).
This NPA was allocated as a direct result of the breakup of the Bell system for
use directly by interexchange (long-distance) carriers, since all existing
numbering ranges were allocated to the exchange (local) carriers. The primary
service offered in this range was "EasyReach 700" from AT&amp;T, which was
basically carrier-managed "follow-me."</p>
<p>Follow-me is a common feature of business telephone systems that allows a call
to a given number (extension or DID) to be directed to one or more real
extensions depending on the location of the intended recipient. For example, a
call to a professional might go to their desk or to an assistant depending on
whether they are in the office, while an auto mechanic might have a call to a
general contact number ring at the front desk or in the shop depending on where
they are.</p>
<p>EasyReach 700 moved this same concept from the PABX to the telephone network,
making it possible for follow-me to span the nation and making it accessible to
businesses without an (expensive) PABX. For example, a consumer with two
different homes could get a 700 number and set it to forward to whichever house
they were staying in, while a traveling salesman could set their 700 number
to forward to whichever hotel they were staying in.</p>
<p>EasyReach was a failure. There were several reasons, but the most significant
relates to the billing climate of the time. Today, unlimited long-distance is
so ubiquitous that the issue may not be obvious, or you might naively assume
that AT&amp;T had found a way to resolve the long distance cost issue. They did
not---in fact, they came up with something worse. The owner of a 700 number
could set it up to either bill forward (to the caller) or reverse (to the
callee). This meant that the caller of a 700 number had virtually no way to
determine whether the call would be free or charged at long-distance rate, and
this was a huge deterrent to use of these numbers.</p>
<p>Today, this and other uses of the 700 NPA have all died out, leaving 700
a nearly empty NPA. Like other empty NPAs, 700 is sometimes hijacked for
special uses by non-mainstream carriers and corporate phone systems. If my
hazy memory is correct, the 700 NPA was used by GE's interoffice leased-line
long distance network when I briefly worked for a GE business. Wikipedia
says that WalMart still uses it this way.</p>
<p>Since the 700 NPA was such a success, AT&amp;T naturally decided to do it again.
In 1993, NANP allocated the 500 NPA to Personal Communications Service (PCS),
not to be confused with Personal Communications Service (PCS). In fact, the
same term was allocated to two completely different purposes by two different
telecom organizations within a few years. The latter refers to a set of
services offered by a wireless network, e.g. Sprint PCS, while the former
refers to...  EasyReach 700 all over again, except for now it's called True
Connections.</p>
<p>True Connections failed for the exact same reasons as EasyReach 700, and was
officially eliminated in 2000, but by this point AT&amp;T had already largely
replaced it with a service using 800 numbers which were of course always
reverse billed...  which you and I might think is obviously what they should
have done in the first place, but back in the '90s toll-free and non-geographic
were viewed as being different animals. It seems to have taken AT&amp;T a long time
to catch on to the fact that the realities of long-distance billing required
that they be closely linked.</p>
<p>The concept of PCS (the non-geographic dialing one) did not die out with True
Connections, and additional NPAs were allocated to the same purpose,
generally in the format of 5 followed by the same digit twice, much like 800.
500 numbers continue to be non-geographic and the billing situation remains
odd, but that hasn't stopped the use of 500 for certain uses like modem banks
for ISPs and some calling cards. Very few 500 numbers remain in use today
despite the multiple allocated 500 codes, and due to the billing issues it's
common for outbound calls to 500 numbers to be blocked. Similar to 700, it's
not unusual for 500 to be used for internal purposes, although this is probably
less of a good idea since PCS services in the 500 NPA have not officially been
ended.</p>
<p>500 and related PCS area codes (500 has a surprising number of overlays
considering how obscure its usage is) also see use for other miscellaneous
telco applications. For example, the 588 area code, also assigned to PCS, was
(and may still be) …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section></section><section><p>The <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/">Taiwan Gold Card</a> is a combined visa, re-entry permit, open work permit and residence permit for Taiwan, valid for up to three years. It’s designed to bring skilled professionals into Taiwan, and if you’ve made more than ~$67k USD/year<label for="sn-1"></label><span>All of the prices are denominated in the law in New Taiwan Dollars, and have been converted into USD at October 2020 rates for this post. The threshold for eligibility is that you make more than $160,000 NTD/month.</span> at any point in the past three years you’re trivially eligible.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>There are also trickier ways to apply, such as proving your expertise in one of the eligible fields: Science and Technology, Economy, Education, Culture and Arts, Sports, Finance, Law, or Architecture. However, the bar for proving expertise is quite high (probably similar to an O-1 visa in the United States, depending on the category).</span> There is no lottery, anyone who is eligible can get approved within a couple months. If you’ve met the income requirement, it’s currently one of the easiest ways to get to Taiwan, and the visa it provides you allows you to enter Taiwan regardless of the COVID-19 situation in your country of origin. This post will explain the process for getting a Gold Card, including several tips that aren’t written down in any official documentation.</p><p>The most important tip is this: if you’re applying via your income, you should apply in the “Economy” category, <em>even if you think a different category describes your work better</em>. The other categories (especially Science and Technology) look for proof of income <strong>and</strong> proof of expertise, despite the law stating that only one is necessary. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, unlike the Ministry of Science and Technology, does things by the books and will approve you solely for the income requirement even if you are not an economist.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>As of February 2021, this may be changing — the Ministry of Economic Affairs appears to be rejecting people who work in fields not related to economics. The Ministry of Science and Technology says that they are now accepting people who work at any company related to science/technology and meet the salary requirement, but it’s too early to tell how strict they are about this.</span> Applying via income in a category other than “Economy” may cause your application to be rejected, and will likely incur a delay in processing your Gold Card request.<label for="sn-4"></label><span>If you’ve already applied in a category other than Economy, you have two options: You can either cancel your current application and submit a new one, paying the application fee a second time, or you can wait the month or two until your application is seen by the relevant ministry, and if it is rejected, change categories then by calling <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">Mr.&nbsp;Huang</a> and explaining the situation (which will not incur the extra fee).</span></p><p>In order to apply, you’ll need a picture of your passport with at least 6 months remaining on it before expiration, a copy of your W-2 or other document that shows your income<label for="sn-5"></label><span>Note that your paystubs are not a valid form of proof. If you don’t have a W-2 or similar tax document showing your full income (for instance, if you were only employed for part of the year), you may be able to get by with a document from your work stating what your income is, but I haven’t heard from anyone who’s done this. The guidelines specify a “月薪” which is translated as “monthly salary” — but this does not necessarily match the legal definition of salary as used in the US, which implies an employment relationship and a W-2. Things that are “月薪”: definitely W-2, possibly 1099-MISC. Things that are not 月薪: income reported on 1099-K, such as taking payment through card networks or being an Uber driver.</span>, a passport-style photo of yourself (a selfie taken in front of a white wall is fine), and a credit card or other method of payment to pay the couple hundred USD application fee.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>The application fees vary from ~$108 - $323 USD ($3,100 - $9,260 NTD) depending on your nationality, the duration of your Gold Card, and whether you apply from inside Taiwan or not. You can find how much the fee is for you in <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">this FAQ</a>. I paid $282 USD as an American applying for a 3-year Gold Card from outside of Taiwan.</span> Once you’ve got all that together, go to the <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">application website</a>, click “I want to apply”, then “Self application”, and create an account. Then start a new Gold Card application and fill out the form. It’ll ask for your address in Taiwan, you can leave it blank if you don’t know where you’ll be staying (which you probably don’t, yet).<label for="sn-7"></label><span>Once you do have an address in Taiwan, you should go to the <abbr title="National Immigration Agency">NIA</abbr> within 30 days to get a new copy of your Gold Card with the address on it.</span> It’ll also ask if you want to apply in Taiwan or at a consulate/embassy overseas - you should probably pick whatever consulate you’re closest to, I went with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco. You will also need to pick how long you want the card to be valid for, from 1-3 years. There is very little downside to picking a longer duration — it costs a trivial amount more, and is no harder to get.<label for="sn-8"></label><span>A possible reason to pick 2 years is if you want to reapply for a 3-year gold card in 2 years, using your current year’s salary — if, for instance, you expect to not be making enough for the salary cutoff once you move to Taiwan. I have no idea if this actually works (the Gold Card program is fairly new, so there aren’t many stories of people reapplying), but it’s worth considering, especially seeing as it could get you enough time to be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/152932/">APRC</a>.</span></p><p>Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll need to wait a few weeks for it to be processed — it took mine 25 days, and I think anywhere from 3 weeks to a month is pretty normal. Either you’ll get a message asking you to provide additional documentation (unlikely, if you’re using a W-2 and submitted everything correctly), or you’ll get an email asking you to submit your passport to the application location that you’ve selected.</p><p>Once you get to the passport submission stage, it can be a bit unclear what to do — you can’t visit in person in most places due to COVID-19<label for="sn-9"></label><span>in the United States, at least.</span>, and the SF TECO at least does not answer phone calls or emails<label for="sn-10"></label><span>While the main SF TECO phone number goes unanswered, if you have Gold Card questions, you can call Angela at (415) 364-5632 and she should be able to help. The line is often busy, but if you leave a message she’ll get back to you.</span> (although other TECOs may be better, you should at least try calling your local TECO). What you need to do is pretty simple, however: just mail in the passport submission notice PDF that you can download on the application website (Download → Download Passport Submission Notice), your passport or a notarized copy of your passport, and a self-addressed USPS priority mail return envelope.</p><p>If like me, you don’t want to send in your physical passport, getting a notarized copy is pretty easy.<label for="sn-11"></label><span>In California, at least — laws vary by state, make sure to check your local laws.</span> Make a document with a copy of your passport<label for="sn-12"></label><span>I used a photo that I scaled so the passport was 1:1 with real life when printed, since I don’t have a scanner.</span> (just the first page and signature is fine, no need to include the stamp pages) and the statement “I, &lt;my name&gt;, affirm that the attached is a true and complete copy of the document which it purports to represent.” Then take that document to a notary and have them notarize your signature on it.</p><p>Once the TECO receives your envelope with the passport, you should get an email saying you’re approved, and only waiting on getting the physical Gold Card in the mail. If you need to fly to Taiwan before it arrives, you can print out a form that will allow you to board the plane on the application website, under “Download → Download Resident Authorization.” If you do this, you’ll need to pay a ~$18 USD ($500 NTD) fee to replace the card once you get to Taiwan. About 21 days after you get the email saying you’re approved<label for="sn-13"></label><span>I was told it would be at most 21 days, but it took 25 for me.</span> you should get a call from the TECO asking to schedule an appointment for you to pick up your Gold Card.<label for="sn-14"></label><span>They may say that this is an “interview,” but you’ve already been approved, so you shouldn’t worry too much about that. They asked me what I do for work, what connections I have in Taiwan, when I planned to go, and where I planned to stay.</span></p><p>Note that the start date (and thus the end date) of your Gold Card is determined by the day the passport is approved, so you may want to be a little strategic if you apply for a Gold Card significantly before you want to go to Taiwan — you can get all the way to the passport submission stage, then wait until a month or so before you plan to leave to actually submit your passport. Obviously there’s a tradeoff here — there’s some risk that your passport won’t be processed in time, but it may be worth considering, depending on your situation.</p><p>If you have any problems during this process, you can find a person to call for assistance on <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">this contact page</a>. Dialing Taiwan phone numbers from the United States can be tricky, but the thing that worked for me was dialing +886, then the area code with the leading zero omitted, then the rest of the number. Dialing 011 before the number or leaving on the zero in the area code would cause the call to fail for me, but your carrier may be different.</p><p>You might also want to check out the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=6501F7D3D7CCA8A0">official website</a>, <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">official FAQ</a>, <a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653">thread on the forumosa forum</a>, the <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/">unofficial FAQ</a>, or <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">Tom Fifield’s blog post</a>.</p><p>Enjoy Taiwan!</p><p><i>Thanks to Brandon Liu for providing additional information about valid sources of income.</i></p></section><section><p><a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/">☙</a></p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Modern software controls dependencies because it helps software authors</h2>

	<p><small>February 20, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363196953065099265">I had a hot take</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hot take: Every distribution packager who's saying "you shouldn't
bundle dependencies" is implicitly telling software authors "you
should do more work for us and limit the features (and reliability) of
your software".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was sparked by reading <a href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/">The modern packagerâ€™s security
nightmare</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zb1c4k/modern_packager_s_security_nightmare">via</a>.
I'm not exactly on one side or the other, but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363263921960980485">I do think distributions
should be honest about what they're asking for</a> and I
don't think they're going to get it.)</p>

<p>This hot take is a bit too narrow. What really matters is software
authors and modern software systems restricting the versions of
dependencies (for both maximum and minimum versions). Explicit or
implicit bundling on top of that just makes the problem slightly worse
for distributions.</p>

<p>For software authors, restricting the versions of dependencies that
they work with reduces the amount of work that they have to do,
both to test against a range of versions and to either forever chase
after whatever changes those dependencies like to make or to forever
limit what features of dependencies they use to ones available in
old versions (and sometimes both at once). In theory, both testing
and chasing after changes would be dealt with by <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (if everyone followed it), at least for a
single program. In practice, not only are people fallible but also
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SemverHasLimits">people have a different understanding of what semantic versioning
means</a> because semantic versioning is ultimately
a social thing, not a technical one. Our field's history has shown
(sometimes vividly) that if software authors allow versions of
dependencies to move on them, soon or later things break and the
software author has to fix it.</p>

<p>(There's also the practical issue that not all dependencies even
claim or agree to follow semantic versioning in the first place.)</p>

<p>For distributors, once software authors start restricting versions
the distributor has both an upgrade problem and a distribution
problem. On the upgrade side, dealing with an issue in a program may now
require persuading it to accept a new version of a dependency. On the
distribution side, it's now likely that you'll have multiple programs
that have different version requirements for the same dependency. At the
very least this multiplies the packages involved.</p>

<p>(Many distributions also have package system design problems that
restricts the range of versions of things that they can have installed
at the same time. Even under <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, this is a
problem for the distribution the moment that you have two programs
with conflicting version requirements that can't both be packaged and
installed at the same time.)</p>

<p>However, there's no free lunch here. What distributors want when
they ask for unbundled dependencies without version restrictions is
for software authors to do the work to accept any version of their
dependencies, or at least any version that falls within <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and for dependencies to faithfully follow semver and
also make it possible to package and install different major versions
(at least) at the same time. <strong>Accepting a broad version range of your
dependencies is actual work</strong>, even apart from the limitations it may
impose on what your code and your software can do. Software authors and
the creators of software package ecosystems (like Go and Rust) are not
refusing to do this because they don't like distributions; they are
refusing to do this because they have found, over and over again, that
this doesn't really work and does cause problems for software authors
(and often users of programs) in the long run.</p>

<p>(The software community that's gone through this experience the
most visibly is Go, which started out with intrinsically unversioned
dependencies that were used universally across all your programs
by default and wound up switching to strongly versioned dependencies
after many people had many problems with that initial state. Go
experienced so many problems that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/FallibleSemverAndMVS">they adopted an unusually strict
and software author friendly versioning scheme</a>.)</p>

<p>It's popular for people to argue that software authors should be doing
this work anyway even if the distributions weren't asking for it,
so them actually doing it is no big deal. This is quite convenient
for the people making the argument, but it doesn't make the argument
valid. Software authors don't owe anyone any work what so ever; they
do whatever work serves their needs and is interesting to them. With
limited time and interest, it's both rational and proper for software
authors to optimize for their own development.</p>

<p>PS: Generally distributions also want some combination of all software
to update to the latest version of their dependencies and for
dependencies to explicitly support older versions. This is also extra
work for software authors, especially when the distribution also wants
it to happen for older versions of programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Time has washed up more than some lost films</strong> as regards the life of Fritz Lang. Recent research has cast a new light on Lang’s first marriage and while the private lives of screen personalities rarely interest me, in this case it has already affected how his films are being viewed by at least by one recent biographer. The events concerning his first wife occurred either in the post-production of “Das wandernde Bild” or “Vier um die Frau” or the pre-production of “Der müde Tod,” although even that is a guess.</p><p><strong>Lang’s first wife was named Lisa Rosenthal</strong> although no source is absolutely positive about that and she is described – in some accounts – as a “Russian from Vilnius.” Little else is known about her and it is not her life that is fascinating as much as it is her death. One reference that I found was in Robert A. Armour’s <em>Fritz Lang</em>, published by Twayne Publishers in 1977. Armour wrote, “[Fritz] Lang divorced his first wife and married [Thea] von Harbou.”</p><p><strong>Lang didn’t divorce Lisa Rosenthal.</strong> Rosenthal died of a gunshot wound to the chest and therein hangs a tale that Lang left behind when he fled from Germany in 1933. The story is told in Patrick McGilligan’s <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast </em>and the recap goes something like this: Thea von Harbou was married to actor Rudolf Klien-Rogge and when her affair with Lang – that was no secret to the film community – heated up, she moved out of her home with Klien-Rogge and moved into the same apartment building as Fritz Lang. One day Lisa Rosenthal comes home unexpectedly and finds Lang and Harbou engaged in “violent petting,” as Lang described it later, on the sofa. Shortly thereafter, Rosenthal is found dead in the bathtub from a gunshot to the chest delivered by Lang’s WWI sidearm that he kept as a memento. Phone calls were made but it wasn’t the police that were called immediately and suspicions flew. Harbou and Lang swore that Rosenthal shot herself and there was little the police could do and Lang and Harbou were charged with denial of assistance although that charge was soon dropped.&nbsp;</p><div id="Layer4">
    <p><strong>Suspicion fell on Lang that he had shot Lisa Rosenthal</strong> and émigrés brought that story to Hollywood years later although only in hushed tones and never when Lang was within earshot. No one has ever suggested that Thea von Harbou was in any way involved although obviously, if Lang killed his wife, von Harbou was some sort of accomplice even if only after-the-fact. What’s interesting in all of this is that so little is known about von Harbou. </p>
    <p><strong>There is talk that after “Der müde Tod”</strong> was finished Lang was committed to an insane asylum for a brief stay. Lang would mention in interviews that he visited insane asylums as a part of his research. The truth is lost to time. At this point all that remains is stories and gossip. Patrick McGilligan wrote, “No record of an inquest – no record, even, of Lisa Rosenthal’s death – could be found in the course of research for [<em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>].” Studio executives – including Erich Pommer – showed up at the scene and much like Hollywood moguls they influenced and cajoled the police to protect their star. </p>
    <p><strong>Frederick Ott in <em>The Films of Fritz Lang</em></strong> describes the death of the unnamed Frau Lang as an “apparent” suicide. Lotte Eisner in <em>Fritz Lang </em>states that Lang’s wife “committed suicide” and wrote in her biography <em>Ich hatte einst ein schones Vaterland: Memoiren</em>, published in 1984 and never translated into English: “[Lisa Rosenthal] then went into the bedroom [sic] and shot herself.” </p>
    <p><strong>McGilligan states: “Perhaps suicide</strong> was such a familiar condition in his mind that it leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue unbidden when the police arrived at his apartment on that fateful day, asking him to explain the inexplicable.” McGilligan bases this assumption on the content of Lang’s work stating that: “From the first film to the last, guilt, complicity, false accusation, irredeemable crime, inadvertent killings, and suicide haunt Lang’s work.” All of that is true except for the “guilt” and McGilligan seems to skip over the murders in Lang’s films. What “leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue” implies that something else had occurred and there is only one other possibility. McGilligan then writes: “After the death of Lisa Rosenthal, the litany [of suicides in Lang’s films] is compelling.” McGilligan then lists the suicides in Lang’s films and describes them as “unmistakable thematic statements.” </p>
    <p><strong>According to one study of Weimar films,</strong> the three major themes in the top 25% of the films were guilt [about starting WWI], generational issues and suicide. Suicide was common in the films of Weimar as it would be later in films in France and Asia. It began to wane in the years of the Hays Code in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>To attempt to solve whether Lisa Rosenthal’s death</strong> was murder or suicide by the content of the films Fritz Lang made after the event – especially the Hollywood films where Lang rarely had influence over the script – doesn’t make for a compelling case. Especially since a list of murders in Lang’s films would run even longer than a list of suicides. </p>
    <p><strong>Then again, a pistol being</strong> within grasping range shows up in Lang’s films quite often. McGilligan has produced an excellent biography of Lang and presents research that helps to understand the times that Lang lived. Where the author isn’t as impressive is in his understanding of the films and filmmaking as an art (eg, his description of the ending of “Spione” is inaccurate). There is no Hollywood ending to this story, no convenient set of symbols pointing to a resolution. There is only a dead woman with a gunshot chest wound bleeding in a bathtub and a lot of unanswered questions. That’s the end of the story. </p>

The aeroplane operating flight LGT5504 to New York JFK experienced heavy damage on an engine shortly after take-off. Engine parts (turbine blades) fell in the nearby village of Meerssen resulting in 2 people slightly injured and damage to cars.</strong></p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the South Limburg Safety Region, an explosion has probably occurred in engine number one of the aircraft. Metal parts such as turbine blades have come down around the Limburg town of Meerssen.</p>
<p>Debris hit an elderly woman, who was slightly injured as a result. A child also burned his fingers on a piece of metal.</p>
<p>In Meerssen several houses and cars got damaged by falling debris.</p>
<p>The thirty-year-old plane immediately diverted on three engines to Liège airport, where it landed safely after making a number of laps over the Ardennes to burn fuel and lose weight.</p>

<p>According to aviation expert Joris Melkert, it is a special incident: “<em>I cannot remember a recent case in the Netherlands where parts of an engine fell down.</em>”</p>
<p>The cause of the incident is unknown. The engine may have sucked up something causing the turbine blades to break. This is what the debris looks like, says the airport spokesman.</p>
<p>The police are calling on people to leave the debris behind, in connection with recording the damage.</p>
<p>The Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid (Dutch Safety Board) has started an exploratory investigation.</p>
<p>Spotter Aubrey Verbaere was present at Liège Airport when the Longtail Boeing 747 landed and provided <em>Aviation24.be</em> with the following pictures:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post marks the start of a series of posts about the internals and interesting bits of various Windows based <strong>I</strong>nter-<strong>P</strong>rocess-<strong>C</strong>ommunication (IPC) technology components. Initially this series will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Named Pipes</li>
  <li>LPC</li>
  <li>ALPC</li>
  <li>RPC</li>
</ul>

<p>A few IPC technology components are therefore left out, but I might append this series sometime and include for example some of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Window Messages</li>
  <li>DDE (which is based on Window Messages)</li>
  <li>Windows Sockets</li>
  <li>Mail Slots</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright so let’s get down to it with Named Pipes…</p>

<p>Although the name might sound a bit odd pipes are a very basic and simple technology to enable communication and share data between two processes, where the term <strong>pipe</strong> simply describes a section of shared memory used by these two processes.<br>
To term this correctly right from the beginning, the IPC technology we’re speaking about is called ‘pipes’ and there are two types of pipes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Named Pipes</li>
  <li>Anonymous Pipes</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time when speaking about pipes you’re likely referring to Named Pipes as these offer the full feature set, where anonymous pipes are mostly used for child-parent communications. This also implies: Pipe communication can be between two processes on the same system (with named and anonymous pipes), but can also be made across machine boundaries (only named pipes can talk across machine boundaries). As Named Pipes are most relevant and support the full feature set, this post will focus only on Named Pipes.</p>

<p>To add some historical background for Named Pipes: Named Pipes originated from the OS/2 times. It’s hart to pin down the exact release date named pipes were introduced to Windows, but at least it can be said that it must have been supported in Windows 3.1 in 1992 - as this support is stated in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/win_dos_dev_jrnl_v4n4_apr_93/page/n23/mode/2up?q=Pipes">Windows/DOS Developer’s Journal Volume 4</a>, so it’s fair to assume named pipes have been added to Windows in the early 1990’s.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the Named Pipe internals, please take note that a few code snippets will follow that are taken from my public <a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/tree/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server">Named Pipe Sample Implementation</a>. Whenever you feel you want some more context around the snippets head over to the code repo and review the bigger picture.</p>

<h2 id="named-pipe-messaging">Named Pipe Messaging</h2>

<p>Alright so let’s break things down to get a hold of Named Pipe internals. When you’ve never heard of Named Pipes before imaging this communication technology like a real, steel pipe - you got a hollow bar with two ends and if you shout something into one end a listener will hear your words on the other end. That’s all a Named Pipe does, it transports information from one end to another.<br>
If you’re a Unix user you sure have used pipes before (as this is not a pure Windows technology) with something like this:
<code>cat file.txt | wc -l</code>. A command that outputs the contents of <code>file.txt</code>, but instead of displaying the output to STDOUT (which could be your terminal window) the output is redirected (“piped”) to the input of your second command <code>wc -l</code>, which thereby counts the lines of your file. That’s an example of an anonymous pipe.</p>

<p>A Windows based Named Pipe is as easily understood as the above example. To enable us to use the full feature set of pipes, we’ll move away from Anonymous Pipes and create a Server and a Client that talk to each other.<br>
A Named Pipe simply is an Object, more specifically a <strong>FILE_OBJECT</strong>, that is managed by a special file system, the <strong>Named Pipe File System (NPFS)</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_KernelObject.png" alt="NamedPipe KernelObject"></p>

<p>When you create a Named Pipe, let’s say we call it ‘fpipe’, under the hood you’re creating a FILE_OBJECT with your given name of ‘fpipe’ (hence: <u>named</u> pipe) on a special device drive called ‘pipe’.<br>
Let’s wrap that into a something practical. A named pipe is created by calling the WinAPI function <strong>CreateNamedPipe</strong>, such as with the below [<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeServer/CPP-Basic-PipeServer.cpp#L88">Source</a>]:<br></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HANDLE</span> <span>serverPipe</span> <span>=</span> <span>CreateNamedPipe</span><span>(</span>
    <span>L"</span><span>\\\\</span><span>.</span><span>\\</span><span>pipe</span><span>\\</span><span>fpipe"</span><span>,</span>	<span>// name of our pipe, must be in the form of \\.\pipe\&lt;NAME&gt;</span>
    <span>PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX</span><span>,</span> <span>// open mode, specifying a duplex pipe so server and client can send and receive data</span>
    <span>PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE</span><span>,</span>	<span>// MESSAGE mode to send/receive messages in discrete units (instead of a byte stream)</span>
    <span>1</span><span>,</span>			<span>// number of instanced for this pipe, 1 is enough for our use case</span>
    <span>2048</span><span>,</span>		<span>// output buffer size</span>
    <span>2048</span><span>,</span>		<span>// input buffer size</span>
    <span>0</span><span>,</span>			<span>// default timeout value, equal to 50 milliseconds</span>
    <span>NULL</span>		<span>// use default security attributes</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For now the most interesting part of this call is the <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\fpipe</code>.<br>
C++ requires escaping of slashes, so language independent this is equal to <code>\\.\pipe\fpipe</code>. The leading ‘\.’ refers to your machines global root directory, where the term ‘pipe’ is a symbolic link to the NamedPipe Device.</p>

<p><img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_SymbolicLink.png" alt="NamedPipe SymbolicLink"></p>

<p>Since a Named Pipe Object is a FILE_OBJECT, accessing the named pipe we just created is equal to accessing a “normal” file.<br>
Therefore connecting to a named pipe from a client is therefore as easy as calling <code>CreateFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeClient/CPP-Basic-PipeClient.cpp#L58">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HANDLE</span> <span>hPipeFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>CreateFile</span><span>(</span><span>L"</span><span>\\\\</span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>\\</span><span>pipe</span><span>\\</span><span>fpipe"</span><span>,</span> <span>GENERIC_READ</span> <span>|</span> <span>GENERIC_WRITE</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>OPEN_EXISTING</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once connected reading from a pipe just needs a call to <code>ReadFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeClient/CPP-Basic-PipeClient.cpp#L65">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span><span>hPipeFile</span><span>,</span> <span>pReadBuf</span><span>,</span> <span>MESSAGE_SIZE</span><span>,</span> <span>pdwBytesRead</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before you can read some data off a pipe, you want your server to write some data to it (which you can read.). That is done by calling - who would have guessed it - <code>WriteFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeServer/CPP-Basic-PipeServer.cpp#L110">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WriteFile</span><span>(</span><span>serverPipe</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>messageLenght</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bytesWritten</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But what actually happens when you “write” to a pipe?<br>
Once a client connects to your server pipe, the pipe that you created is no longer in a listening state and data can be written to it. The user land call to <code>WriteFile</code> is dispatched to kernel land, where <code>NtWriteFile</code> is called, which determines all the bits and pieces about the Write-Operation, e.g. which device object is associated with the given file, whether or not the Write-Operation should be made synchronous (see section <a href="#overlapping-pipe-io-blocking-mode--in-out-buffers">Overlapping Pipe I/O, Blocking mode &amp; In-/Out Buffers</a>), the I/O Request Packet (IRP) is set up and eventually <em>NtWriteFile</em> takes care that your data is written to the file. In our case the specified data is not written to an actual file on disk, but to a shared memory section that is referenced by the file handle return from <code>CreateNamedPipe</code>.</p>

<p>Finally - as mentioned in the introduction - Named Pipes can also be used over a network connection across system boundaries.<br>
There are no additional implementations needed to call a remote Named Pipe server, just make sure that your call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> specifies an IP or hostname (as with the example above).<br>
Let’s make a guess: What network protocol will be used when calling a remote pipe server? …. drum rolls … absolutely unsurprising it is <strong>SMB</strong>.<br>
An SMB connection is made to the remote server, which is by default initialized by a negotiation request to determine the network authentication protocol. Unlike with other IPC mechanisms, such as with RPC, you as a server developer can not control the network authentication protocol as this is always negotiated through SMB. Since Kerberos is the preferred authentication scheme since Windows 2000, Kerberos will be negotiated if possible.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> From a client perspective you can effectively choose the authentication protocol by choosing to connect to a hostname or to an IP. Due to the design of Kerberos it cannot handle IPs very well and as such if you choose to connect to an IP address the result of the negotiation will always be NTLM(v2). Whereas when you connect to a hostname you will most likely always end up using Kerberos.</p>

<p>Once the authentication is settled, the actions that client and server want to perform are once again just classic file actions, that are handled by SMB just as any other file operation, e.g. by starting a ‘Create Request File’ request as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_RemoteRead.png" alt="NamedPipe RemoteRead"></p>

<h3 id="data-transfer-modes">Data Transfer Modes</h3>

<p>Named pipes offer two basic communication modes: byte mode and message mode.</p>

<p>In <strong>byte mode</strong>, messages travel as a continuous stream of bytes between the client and the server. This means that a client application and a server application do not know precisely how many bytes are being read from or written to a pipe at any given moment. Therefore a write on one side will not always result in a same-size read on the other. This allows a client and a server to transfer data without caring about the size of the data.</p>

<p>In <strong>message mode</strong>, the client and the server send and receive data in discrete units. Every time a message is sent on the pipe, it must be read as a complete message. If you read from a server pipe in message mode, but your read buffer is too small to hold all of the data then the portion of data that fits in your buffer will be copied over to it, the remaining data stays in the server’s shared memory section and you’ll get an error 234 (0xEA, ERROR_MORE_DATA) to indicate that there is more data to fetch.</p>

<p>A visual comparison of the messages modes is shown below, taken from “Network programming for Microsoft Windows” (1999):
<img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_MessageModes.png" alt="NamedPipe Message Modes"></p>

<h3 id="overlapping-pipe-io-blocking-mode--in-out-buffers">Overlapping Pipe I/O, Blocking mode &amp; In-/Out Buffers</h3>

<p>Overlapping I/O, Blocking mode and In-/Out Buffers are not amazingly important from a security standpoint, but being aware that these exists and what they mean can aid understanding, communication, building and debugging named pipes. Therefore I will add these concepts here briefly.</p>

<p><strong>Overlapping I/O</strong><br>
Several Named Pipe related functions, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-transactnamedpipe">TransactNamedPipe</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-connectnamedpipe">ConnectNamedPipe</a> can …</p></div></div>

<p>There were countless times when I’ve heard something like “I’ll leave this behind” in different forms from different people. Or even as a question: “what are you going to leave behind?”. People say this being serious, they don’t have a clue. This socially-accepted principle, saying that a finite life is okay and aging is a good argument in any controversy and a respectable excuse for virtually anything, is wedged deeply and firmly into their heads. But…<span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p>If you’re not alive, you’re nothing. And the world doesn’t exist for you, too. So does everything (or everybody) you’ve left there, because <strong>you</strong> don’t exist in the first place. You’ll become nothing. Void. Zero. What a null pointer points to.&nbsp;Just try to imagine this. You’re reading this blog post right now, but in a single moment it disappeared. As did a device you’re reading it on, as did a room where you’re doing that, as did a&nbsp;server where it’s hosted, as did the city, as did the country, as did the planet, as did you… <strong>Nothing</strong>. Everything just turned into nothing, including yourself. See that? Great, let’s move on.</p>
<p>This is a main argument when there are no valid arguments left. It is typically used as follows:<br>
— Whenever you’ll have children…<br>
— I’m not going to have any children.<br>
— How come? Are you alright?<br>
— Yes, I’m perfectly fine. I just don’t see any point in that. I’ll better improve myself.<br>
— But wait, you need to procreate.<br>
— For what exactly?<br>
— <strong>Who are you going to leave behind?&nbsp;</strong><span>(this can come in different forms, including “who’s going to bring flowers to your grave”, but the meaning is always identical)</span><br>
That’s all, every following argument is invalid. After this, I usually start reciting the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>If I’m going to cease to exist, it doesn’t matter what would be in a world without me. Because if I’m not going to exist in it, it’s not going to exist for me; that’s like a full-featured end of the world. If I’m not going to cease to exist, there’s also no reason to have children: they’re only needed because of mortality, they require inadequate amounts of time, they add a crapload of new responsibilities and ultimately make a human a slave of circumstances for at least 15 years. For what? For nothing, just because. Don’t seek a rational explanation, you won’t find it. It doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>One another argument that people really like using: “<strong>they’ll do for you everything you want/dream of</strong>“, or even “<strong>children are our immortality</strong>“. And it’s not valid, too. They won’t do for you things you want; they’re separate personalities, not your own helper robots. They’ve got their own life and their own missions in it, and it’s in no way a sequel to any of parents’ lives. It’s like a new branch in a version control system, if you know what I mean. A branch that will develop by itself and, most likely, will never get back to master, no matter how much you’d like to think the opposite. It’s much more useful both for yourself and for the humanity to improve yourself instead of teaching basic things to a brand-new human that’s going to take his own route, and that route likely won’t match yours. So no, children are not our immortality. They are the best way to kill time (and eventually yourself).</p>
<p>— <strong>But evolution…</strong><br>
Seriously? No. It’s no longer needed. Imagine this world as it was 300 years ago. There was&nbsp;no internet and computers, no electricity, no cars, planes, and trains, many of those things we can’t live without today just weren’t invented back then. All of this had been invented or discovered in those last 300 years. Impressive, isn’t it? And the scientific and technical progress isn’t going to stop. Can you remotely guess what new will be introduced in the XXI century? So can’t I. Do you see how fast the humanity is developing? It does so by itself, without any external intervention and without any help from the nature. Natural evolution was intended to adapt species to the environment but it’s not of much help for a modern human because he can adapt to anything himself, and do so a billion times faster and more efficiently. People are going to the space because they’ve invented rockets and space suits, something the natural evolution won’t ever do. We’ve already superseded the evolution, so we don’t actually need it any more.</p>
<p>— <strong>But that’s natural…</strong><br>
Are you living for yourself or for the nature? If the latter, immediately quit your internet, find yourself a partner of the opposite gender and go to an uninhabited island, without any belongings. It’ll be a success if you hit 30 years living there. It’s natural to reach puberty, pass some genetic material along and die, not to read posts in my blog. The nature isn’t our friend. It’s our enemy. Yes, it gave us our lives, it gave us this planet with everything we can find on it. But you also shouldn’t forget that the nature stands behind, among all other things, the most terrible diseases humanity had ever seen, natural disasters and, ultimately, the fact that the human life is finite. If the nature doesn’t care about humans, why should humans care about it?</p>
<p>— <strong>But it’ll be boring to live forever!</strong><br>
You’ve got tired of your life, it became dull and everything around you drives you crazy? Take a nap. Play some video games. Read some reddit. Chat with your friends. Learn a new skill. Go traveling somewhere. But please, don’t say that the life can become boring to the stage where you’ll want to terminate it. Because <strong>you can’t have unsolvable problems as long as you’re alive</strong>, whereas a dead person has exactly one such problem: they have no way to come back to life.&nbsp;So no, it won’t become that boring. Any problems go away as time goes by, except the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>So, you can really come to one conclusion from all of this:</p>
<h2>The meaning of life is to keep on living.</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Getting-started-with-code-coverage-for-Golang.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golang</a>, developed in 2009, is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. At Codecov, it currently sits as the language of choice for over 14% of our open-source repositories, or as the 3rd most widely used language. This blog post will show you how to get a simple Golang project up and running with tests and code coverage with Codecov. You can view the entire source code of this post at our <a href="https://github.com/codecov/example-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example repository</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting started with Goloang</h2>
<p>We will start with a simple calculator app that exposes two functions: <code>Add</code> and <code>Subtract</code>. Both functions accept two integer arguments and return an integer. We can paste the code below into a file called <code>calculator.go</code>.</p>
<p><code>calculator.go</code></p>
<pre><code>package calculator

func Add(x, y int) int {
  return x + y
}

func Subtract(x, y int) int {
  return x - y
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s add a test for our <code>Add</code> function. We can take advantage of Go’s built-in testing libraries to do this. Open a new file called <code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<p><code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<pre><code>package calculator

import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
  if got, want := Add(1, 2), 3; got != want {
    t.Errorf("add method produced wrong result. expected: %d, got: %d", want, got)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The test file will call the <code>Add</code> function and compare its output with our expected value of 3. The test helps ensure that if we change the function later, it will still work as expected.</p>

<h2>Run your tests and get coverage locally</h2>
<p>You can run the test locally by calling <code>go test</code> This should bring up the following successful output.</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; go test
PASS
ok  	{{ SRC_DIRECTORY }}	0.178s
</code></pre>
<p>We can, again, use Golang’s built-in coverage tools to start collecting code coverage</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; go test -race -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.out
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	{{ SRC_DIRECTORY }}	0.160s
</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>covermode</code> and <code>race</code> are not required parameters, they are highly recommended by the Codecov team. <code>coverpofile</code> ensures that we collect coverage, and the metrics will be saved to the file specified, in our case, <code>coverage.out</code>.</p>

<h2>How to upload to Codecov</h2>
<p>Now that we are able to run coverage locally, we can begin uploading these reports to Codecov. We will be taking advantage of Codecov’s <a href="https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bash uploader</a> to do this. We will not go into detail about setting up a pipeline, but Codecov will work with any CI/CD. Below, we show you basic configurations for <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a> and <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CircleCI</a>.</p>
<p><b>GitHub Actions</b></p>
<pre><code>name: Test and coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: '1.14'
      - name: Run coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        run: bash &lt;(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
</code></pre>
<p><b>CircleCI</b></p>
<pre><code>version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/golang:1.15
    steps:

workflow:
  version: 2.1
  build-test:
    jobs:
      - build

<h2>Covering uncovered code</h2>
<p>You will notice that our <code>calculator.go</code> file is only 50% covered which matches with our local coverage. So how can we see what lines aren’t covered? We can click the report from the comment to browse our report</p>

<p>The light green background indicates that all of the above code was added. The darker green bar shows us that that line has been covered by tests, while the red is still uncovered. This makes sense as we only wrote a test for our <code>Add</code> function. The <code>Subtract</code> function still needs a test.</p>
<p>We can add the following code to our test file</p>
<p><code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<pre><code>func TestSubtract(t *testing.T) {
  if got, want := Subtract(3, 2), 1; got != want {
    t.Errorf("Subtract method produced wrong result. expected: %d, got: %d", want, got)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>After committing the above snippet, we see that Codecov shows us that all of our code is covered.</p>

		<p>Posted here on this day Sunday, Dec. 9, 2012 C.E.</p>
		<p>Crafting in MMORPGs is a troublesome, complex issue. The ability for players to create things with which to equip, clothe, and house themselves is difficult for developers to implement, and many companies have tried a variety of ways to try and address this feature. My first real experience with crafting in MMORPGs was in Star Wars: Galaxies, and that has colored my view on crafting ever since. This is not to say that SWG had a perfect system, but it came closest out of all the MMOs I’ve played. This is chiefly due to the following eight factors. This is a fairly long read, so grab a cup of coffee, put on your bunny slippers, and sit back in your favorite chair.</p>
<h2 id="i-item-decay">I: Item Decay</h2>
<p>In early Star Wars: Galaxies, items decayed over time and would eventually become unusable. If an item ever became unusable, it was done - you couldn’t repair it, like in other games since. Even if you repaired items before they became unusable, you were never able to bring it back to full durability. The item’s maximum durability decreased every time you repaired it. The effect this had on the player economy was to keep crafters in business perpetually. There was always a demand for things like weapons and armor, because those players who engaged in combat were always wearing out their gear. Vehicles, after they were added to the game, similarly decayed and could be outright destroyed. I remember distinctly being very upset whenever I lost a swoop, since that meant a long walk back to town and around 20,000 credits spent to replace it. This system of item decay has never been replicated in any other game.</p>
<h2 id="ii-customization">II: Customization</h2>
<p>When crafting an item in SWG, you were able to choose its final appearance in a few ways. Clothing was the most customizable, with a variety of colors available. Weapons could have different models with different barrels (in the case of blasters). Armor, similarly, could have multiple colors. The skill level of the crafter determined to what degree the item could be customized. This meant that high-level crafters were in high demand for those players who cared about appearances, and could charge more for their services. Oddly enough, item customization as far as appearance goes has never been done very well in MMORPGs. That crown goes to Blacklight: Retribution, a free-to-play online FPS with excellent weapon customization. The game lets you change barrels, stocks, triggers, bodies, accessories, and colors of all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="iii-experimentation">III: Experimentation</h2>
<p>Part of the crafting process in Star Wars: Galaxies allowed you to improve the quality of a crafted item before finishing it. You could choose multiple areas to try and improve; in the case of blasters, for example, you could experiment on increasing damage, range, or accuracy. Depending on the crafter’s skill and the materials used to create the item, experimentation could greatly enhance, marginalize, or utterly wreck a crafted item’s stats. No other game since has implemented an item-modification system quite like this.</p>
<h2 id="iv-resource-variation">IV: Resource Variation</h2>
<p>Every resource in Star Wars: Galaxies had a unique set of statistics. Different kinds of item recipes used different sets of these statistics to determine the item’s qualities. Additionally, resource spawns in the game universe varied by planet and were in limited areas and densities. Every week, a new set of resources would spawn throughout the universe, and the old spawn areas were gone forever. This meant no resource would ever appear more than once, and really good resources thus became very precious. Because of this system, harvesting itself became a lucrative business. Some players devoted multiple accounts just to collecting the best resources and selling them to other players. Some games have come close to this kind of variation. Oddly, the one that has nearly replicated SWG’s resource variation is an MMOFPS rather than an MMORPG - Firefall. Like SWG, Firefall’s resources appear for a limited time, have multiple statistics that are randomly generated, and never appear twice.</p>
<h2 id="v-automated-harvesting">V: Automated Harvesting</h2>
<p>This feature made a world of difference to the crafting economy. Players could craft automated harvesters and place them in the world. Then, the player that placed the harvester chose one of the resources available in that area from the harvester’s command panel, and it would steadily recover a certain amount of that resource every minute or so. Harvesters required fuel to operate, which itself was a resource that could be harvested. Harvesters could be experimented on and improved in multiple areas, just like other items, and so a niche market existed just for harvesters. Harvesters had an administration list that allowed the owner to designate other players as being able to turn on, fuel, and change the target resource for them. Since every character only had 10 plots, and each harvester took 1 plot, in order to field large numbers of harvesters a player would need to either have multiple accounts or engage the services of other players. This further supported a niche market for harvesting. No other game has ever had automated harvesting, although the idea of harvesting as a lucrative in-game “profession” has been done also by EVE Online.</p>
<h2 id="vi-mass-production">VI: Mass Production</h2>
<p>In addition to automated harvesters, players could craft and place factories. These buildings took power and maintenance credits like harvesters. They also had a hopper of limited space for ingredients and for generated items. At the end of the crafting process, players had the option of creating a blueprint instead of a finished item. They could take that blueprint, and stacks of the ingredients used to produce the item, and place them in a factory. Once the factory was turned on, it would generate copies of that item until it ran out of power, maintenance credits, ingredients, or available space in the output hopper. Not only was this a godsend for crafters looking to mass produce items for sale, it also was a requirement to create certain items. Many of the higher-end crafted items required “identical” components - that is, stacks of items created by a factory from a blueprint. No other game has ever done this. While not a requirement for a good crafting system, it’s necessary to support sandbox games that rely on player crafted items, since small populations can still create large numbers of items.</p>
<h2 id="vii-loot-sucks">VII: Loot Sucks</h2>
<p>Players that chose to engage in PvE gameplay in SWG relied heavily on the crafters. Items looted from humanoid NPCs were never very good, and creatures had no loot at all until later in SWG’s life. This meant that player-crafted gear was the only option for combatants, and required players to work together in order to play the game. Lone wolves rarely did well. No MMORPG other than early SWG has ever done this again. Even SWG itself later did away with this, preferring to give players vendor trash, crafting components, and crafting blueprints.</p>
<h2 id="viii-non-instanced-housing">VIII: Non-Instanced Housing</h2>
<p>Non-instanced housing itself is not particularly relevant to crafting. However, the way it was implemented in SWG makes it vital to that ecosystem. All player-owned buildings were player-crafted. Harvesters, factories, houses, guild halls, city halls, shuttleports, med centers, and taverns were all created by players. And they were very expensive to build, at least at first. When player cities were first added to the game, I was my guild’s Architect (an in-game profession dedicated solely to crafting buildings). Leading up to the release of player cities, we stockpiled large quantities of the resources needed to build the various city buildings. As soon as the update went live, I sat at my structure crafting station and put together a city hall deed, and we rushed to be one of the player cities on our planet. At the time, only ten cities could be established on any given planet. We were too late to be one of the cities on Corellia, so we hurriedly traveled to its moon, Tarus, and set down roots a kilometer northwest of the Imperial outpost there. In order to craft that city hall, and any high-end items, I need a personal crafting station of the appropriate type for the item. Public crafting stations couldn’t stand in for them. Personal crafting stations needed to be placed in a player house, and they took a number of advanced components. They had a direct impact on the final quality of items, so all serious crafters absolutely had to have access to a house with all the different types of personal crafting stations. This led to most guilds having dedicated “crafting houses” that were so equipped, with backpacks placed in them with large quantities of the various resources needed for crafting. No other game has ever had non-instanced housing with such a rich connection to player crafting - both in the building and usage of them. That brings me to the end of my list. I wish I could find a game that had all of these features. SOE may be bringing all of this back with EQ Next, but until we get a science-fiction MMORPG that has all of the above, I don’t think we’ll ever come close to what Star Wars: Galaxies had. Here’s to hoping, though!</p>

                    <p>The book is exciting and the story is funny. In fact, I'm learning something new. So much so, that I keep writing down my ideas and shuffling their implications. And suddenly, I realize something. In the past 15-minutes, I've only managed to cover three pages and I'm already thinking about next things I'm supposed to do. Cleaning, picking-up the groceries, doing my excercises, writing a couple of lines of code, watching a movie... </p><p>Is this supposed to be my Saturday off work?</p><p>So I stop and think. When was the last moment that took longer than 10 seconds, where I didn't have an urge to check an app on my phone, see if I got new email, or impulsively do something else?</p><p>By now, where I live, it's been many months of nightly curfews and limitations on travel and social life. I consider myself a very fortunate person to have suffered a relatively small impact from the global pandemic. Nonetheless, I can't stop but think about why my mind feels so exhausted while at the same time requiring a constant stream of stimulus that results in overbearing distraction. </p><p>It was already before the pandemic that I heard my colleagues talking about "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_detox"><em>digital detox</em></a>" and discussing their efforts to break out of being constantly connected while trying to regain their energy and allowing for some rest. Thus, I surely know that I'm not alone with these thoughts. </p><p>Finally, after subscribing to <a href="https://amzn.to/3alEC3u">Audible</a> last summer, there only remains little time in my day when I am not stimulating my brain in one way or another. It was some sort of a panic that hit me when I realized that I am no longer able to enjoy a thing that I've always enjoyed so much, reading a great book at length. </p><p>Today I called with a good friend of mine and he said: </p><p><em>"Yeah right! It's like we must constantly be multitasking or something... Even when I get to playing a Playstation game and it starts to load, I just all the time have to unlock my phone and check what is going on..."</em></p><h2 id="to-observe-and-reflect">To observe and reflect</h2><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/notes/the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant-by-eric-jorgenson/amp/">a book where Naval describes</a> what meditation means for him, and I cannot help but agree with his way of putting it. </p><p>One only needs to stop and observe his thoughts in a calm state. Your mind is like a monkey in a room, misbehaving and throwing feces all over the walls. It is fascinating how you realize this while trying to focus on your breath and not let your thoughts wander. In a matter of seconds, however, you already catch yourself thinking about entirely something different. When practicing to focus your attention and letting your thoughts pass, this inner monkey seems to eventually calm down and let you achieve a little peace of mind. It is not so easy. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-drawing-LBS-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>One year into the global pandemic - SL 2020 (LBS)</figcaption></figure><p>After so many months of being limited with our social interactions, it feels like the scariest thing out there is to be left by ourselves. Especially us young people tend to handle this quite badly. Without typical distractions and mental stimulus available throughout our days, our mind starts to seek for something to occupy itself resulting in raised anxiety levels and stress. We are today forced to confront our inner selves like never before. </p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>Billions of dollars are invested and brightest specialists are hired each year to engineer new distractions. They fight for every second of our limited attention spans, leading us further astray without us even noticing it. </p><p>When shortest breaks require distraction and only the rarest moments, such as taking a shower, offer a refuge from our electronic devices, how are we supposed to work towards our long-term goals? The type of goals that can only be achieved when managing to work in a state of sustained attention? Rarely do great things in life come in a form of neatly packaged gratification to which we are getting more and more accustomed to. </p><p>Reading reports and hearing on the radio that the general feeling and wellbeing in our societies during these challenging times is again on decline, constant distractions might truly be the enemy that stands in our way of what we ought to achieve.</p><h2 id="fighting-back">Fighting back</h2><p>At some point I read that <a href="https://qz.com/1476157/overworked-south-koreans-are-finding-solace-in-a-fake-prison/">South Koreans already pay to live in a hotel-like "prison"</a> to relieve themselves from digital devices. I'm not quite ready to go that far just yet. </p><p>Admittedly, a cottage in the middle of nowhere in Finland would be the way to go anyways.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-mikkeli-LBS.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Late autumn lakeside view - Year 2016, Finland</figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time before the pandemic I saw a colleague of mine use his phone as we were picking up lunch, and I couldn't help but ask why was the screen black and white? He told me he does it intentionally to make his handset less attractive, resulting in less tapping around. That struck me as bizarre. How odd, do we really need to resort to such approaches? </p><p>So what were some of the smaller changes I did to improve my wellbeing? </p><p>Unlike South Koreans with their voluntary confinement, or my friend with his greyscale screen, I started with some less drastic measures. These small changes proved enormously helpful. </p><p>First of all, I opened the screen-time function on my phone and looked through apps that sent me most notifications, proceeding to drastically dial them back. Today, most phones have a feature to limit the screen-time of apps, locking you out after a certain amount of time has passed. This function is plain useless for me or my friends whom I've seen to just enter their pin every single time they wanted to do something. What I did instead was that I just plain and simply uninstalled Instagram. </p><p>I had contemplated to delete it for a long time and almost did it, but instead always settled to just disable the notifications. When I finally did this however, two interesting realizations struck me. </p><p>First thing was that during the initial couple of weeks without the app I was totally surprised at how little I missed it. It literally had never provided me with anything of value, and I only used it to post an occasional update. Why didn't I uninstall it earlier? There was no feeling of missing out. Wow, this realization echoed a feeling that I had after uninstalling 9GAG many years earlier. </p><p>Second, I didn't even notice how those colorful icons on the home-screen invited me to tap on their respective apps as soon as I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. I understood this in a particularly strong way after hiding another app, LinkedIn. Being an important tool for my work, all I did in addition to hiding it from the homescreen was to disable the last types of notifications I ever received from them. Lo' and behold, I now use this application significantly less and it makes a whole world of a difference. </p><p>Simple, easy and fast. Your life will be better for it, just try! Exponential returns of joy are expected if you have apps like Tiktok, Clubhouse, Snapchat, or other such platforms installed or bookmarked, that you can easily subject to the same fate and never look back.</p><p>So far, I'm mostly talking about my precious free time. But what could be some simple and small things that I could do when I'm working on my projects? </p><h2 id="focus-operate-and-enjoy-the-results">Focus, operate and enjoy the results</h2><p>I've written about doing <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/why-to-do-lists-often-stink-and-how-do-the-truly-successful-people-maintain-their-productivity/">an experiment and turning myself into a productivity monster</a> back in 2017, and I've recently re-read the post and carefully re-implemented some of my learnings this year. But then again, it's not about going radical, but rather focusing on some small things that are easy to implement. </p><p>Kill the unnecessary Slack and Teams notifications now! Adjust the surprisingly good defaults that Slack provides and make sure none of them, except for the most important notifications, hit your phone after your working hours are over. </p><p>Use effective time-blocking techniques like <a href="https://alphaefficiency.com/20-minutes-pomodoro-weekly-experiment/">Pomodoro</a> for the less pleasant and repetitive, but still important tasks. This, like many other things, I've also learned from one of my colleagues using it in an effective manner.</p><p>Oh, and of course make sure to consider the following crazy important golden rule of life and the universe:<strong> </strong>don't do anything else while having a one-on-one interaction with someone. Just never do this. </p><p>I catch myself with this one sometimes and no matter how small of a signal, it can still tell something to my counterpart. Such mistakes during limited and valuable interactions in these pandemic-ridden times can eat away from our important professional relationships. When having conversations, focus on them fully and wholeheartedly. Multitask when the time is right. </p><p>Oh, and try drinking less coffee in the mornings while cutting alcohol in the evenings, but you've heard this a million times before. Additionally, to all of you who have small kids at home, I truly salute your efforts and patience getting through with this! </p><h2 id="the-most-desired-skill-of-the-future">The most desired skill of the future</h2><p>What if the most sought after and desired skill of the future will be the ability to best manage our constant distractions and maintain a sustained state of productive focus? </p><p>If we can't manage to control our whims, we won't be able to work effectively towards our long-term goals. I guess it's just that simple. </p><p>The first step is to stop and observe. </p><p>Reflection and brutal honesty with oneself while trying to understand what is happening is critical before driving corrections and adjustments into one's behavior. As our society adjusts to challenges posed by global pandemics, there is a chance for us to walk out of this stronger than before. This is a chance for us to learn more about ourselves than would've otherwise been possible, right? </p><p>I'm only trying to think about something positive in these pandemic-ridden times.</p><p>Now let's get back to work...</p><hr><p><em>Author's comment:</em></p><div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, consider subscribing for an occasional update.

Most people are living in either side of the spectrum, in bitterness of what we experienced or in the fear of what could happen. Time, if approached inaccurately, can rob us of itself.&nbsp;</p><p>No wonder productivity books are so trendy these days, everyone wants to figure out a way to do more and be more, as if by doing so, our lives will have more meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>What if you can be 100% focused on the tasks at hand? What if the work you’re trying to finish is the only thing that you’ll ever do? What if it was the last thing you’ll ever do?&nbsp;</p><p>This sense of urgency is key to keep yourself rooted in the present, the reality that you only have this present moment to live and do things, the past is never coming back and the future does not even exist.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>To meditate on</strong></h3><p>“At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice - giving yourself a break fro all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes if possible to live an abundant and devout life.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5&nbsp;</p><p>“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past of the future, for how ca someone be deprived of what’s not theirs” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t let you reflection on the whole sweep of life crush you. Don’t fill your mind with all the bad things that might still happen. Stay focused on the present situation and ask yourself why it’s so unbearable and can’t be survived.” - Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 8.36</p><p>“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” - Matthew 6:34&nbsp;</p><p>“So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.“ - 2 Corinthians 4:16&nbsp;</p><p>“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.” - 2 Timothy 1:7&nbsp;</p><p>“Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.“ - Ephesians 5:15-16</p><p>“Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.” - James 4:14</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

                    <p>Docker on MacOS will always be slower than on Linux (well, unless Apple Silicon ends up panning out, which it looks like it might!), but it doesn't have to be as <em>infuriatingly slow</em> as it is by default. &nbsp;In fact, you can get it pretty close to native speed and it's not even all that difficult. &nbsp;It turns out that developing with Docker on MacOS can actually be a really enjoyable experience, not just a compromise you make in order to have a portable development environment.</p><p>The problem is that the default file sync strategy that Docker on MacOS uses is <em>garbage.</em> &nbsp;Sure, it's consistent and compatible, but it's just about the slowest possible option you could go with. &nbsp;As your Docker app runs, it reads and changes files across that sync, which means that every file access slows down your application a little bit more. &nbsp;Compounded, that means that even your average runs are <em>bitterly slow</em>.</p><p>Enter Mutagen. &nbsp;Mutagen does a lot of things and is a very interesting technology in general, but what we're primarily interested in is how it can perform lightning-quick syncs between your local computer and a Docker volume. &nbsp;How fast is it? &nbsp;Well, the title of this article isn't hyperbole, in fact, it's underselling things. &nbsp;My Jest test suite went from taking 73.5 seconds to run to only taking 22.9 seconds (on average).</p><p>So now that we know what the problem is and what the solution is, let's fix Docker on MacOS.</p><p>First, you have to install Mutagen, and as of the writing of this article, you need to install a beta release. &nbsp;We need version 0.12.0 or higher, since that's the version that starts supporting <code>mutagen compose</code> (which we'll get to in a minute). &nbsp;There should be fairly low risk from this, though, since Mutagen's own website says:</p><blockquote><a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/introduction/installation#development-channels">Beta channel releases are fairly stable and can be thought of as something akin to release candidates.</a></blockquote><p>To install Mutagen and start the sync daemon, first, make sure you have <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, and then:</p><pre><code>$ brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-beta
$ mutagen daemon start</code></pre><p>Next, you'll need to modify your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to define the sync that Mutagen will spin up. &nbsp;Assume your current <code>volumes</code> entry for a container looks like:</p><pre><code>    volumes:
      - .:/code</code></pre><p>You'll want to create a new section at the bottom of your file with an <code>x-mutagen</code> configuration. &nbsp;<code>mutagen compose</code> will read that and build your sync from the options you set there:</p><pre><code>x-mutagen:
  sync:
    defaults:
      ignore:
        vcs: true
      mode: "two-way-resolved"

    mount-code:
      alpha: "."
      beta: "volume://mount-code"</code></pre><p><code>alpha</code> is where you're syncing <em>from</em>, and <code>beta</code> is the sync mount point that Mutagen will create. &nbsp;Also of note is the <code>two-way-resolve</code> sync mode we're using. &nbsp;<a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/synchronization#modes">Mutagen has great documentation on how its synchronization modes work</a>, but in short, we're using the mode that prioritizes host files. &nbsp;Since this is development and the files on the host system are the canonical ones anyway, this is safe and prevents conflicts that have to be manually resolved.</p><p>Finally, we have to update our <code>volumes</code> entry to use the new mount point:</p><pre><code>    volumes:
      - mount-code:/code</code></pre><p>And that's it! &nbsp;Well, that's <em>nearly</em> it. &nbsp;<code>docker-compose</code> doesn't know how to read an <code>x-mutagen</code> entry, so instead we now run this file with the <code>mutagen compose</code> command, which is essentially a pass-through to <code>docker-compose</code> after having performed the various sync setup steps you've defined.</p><p>The first time you run this will be longer than before, as Mutagen will need to create the sync mount and perform the initial synchronization, but then it will run as a daemon and keep changes automatically in sync. &nbsp;I have found that occasionally it will run wild with the CPU for a couple dozen seconds as it updates its index (or something), but it hasn't significantly affected my development, especially not when compared against the <em>incredible</em> speed upgrades it provides.</p><h2 id="using-mutagen-in-nodewood">Using Mutagen in Nodewood</h2><p>Now that you have an idea how Mutagen works and how to set it up for your average project, I wanted to provide explicit steps for using it in your Nodewood projects.</p><p>(If you've arrived at this article from another site, you might not know what <a href="https://nodewood.com/">Nodewood</a> is. &nbsp;Nodewood is a JavaScript SaaS starter kit designed to save weeks or months of time when building your next web app. &nbsp;It comes with user authentication &amp; management, subscriptions, and a Docker development environment that is both easy to set up, and – thanks to Mutagen – lightning-fast to use. &nbsp;Interested in using Nodewood to build your next SaaS app? &nbsp;<a href="https://nodewood.com/">Read more here</a>.)</p><p>There are two steps to using Mutagen in Nodewood: 1) Using an application-specific <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and modifying your <code>.nodewood.js</code> configuration file to use Mutagen. &nbsp;(Of course, you'll need to make sure you've already installed Mutagen according to the instructions above.)</p><h3 id="1-set-up-an-app-specific-docker-compose-yml-file">1) Set up an app-specific docker-compose.yml file</h3><p>Nodewood will use a file in the <code>app</code> folder before it will use a file in the <code>wood</code> folder, and this applies to your Docker files as well. &nbsp;Create a file in <code>app/docker/docker-compose.yml</code>, and paste the following:</p><pre><code>version: '3'

      beta: "volume://nodewood-code"
</code></pre><p>This will set up your Mutagen sync mount, and ensure that you're continuing to use the Dockerfiles for Nginx and Postgres that live in the <code>wood/docker</code> folder.</p><h3 id="2-modify-your-nodewood-configuration-file">2) Modify your Nodewood configuration file</h3><p>In your project root, you'll find a file called <code>.nodewood.js</code>. &nbsp;This file contains your Nodewood project information, including your keys that are used to authenticate with the Nodewood server when updating the library code. &nbsp;All you need to do is add the following two lines to the <code>exports</code> object:</p><pre><code>  composeCommand: 'mutagen',
  composeArgs: ['compose'],</code></pre><p>This will instruct the Nodewood CLI to use <code>mutagen compose</code> instead of <code>docker-compose</code> when starting your project for development or tests.</p><p><strong>NOTE: You will need to have v0.13.2 or later of the Nodewood CLI tool installed.</strong> &nbsp;You can update with <code>yarn global add @nodewood/cli</code>.</p><p>That's it! &nbsp;Some simple copy and paste, and your Nodewood development experience should be <em>dramatically</em> improved!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>After a public relations fiasco, Coca-Cola has effectively conceded that some of its employees participated in a public LinkedIn Learning seminar that advocated that some of its employees be “less white.”</p>
<p>The training curriculum was first exposed on Friday by Dr. Karlyn Borysenko, an organizational psychologist who is working to end the racially divisive ideology of ‘critical race theory.’</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨🚨 BREAKING: Coca-Cola is forcing employees to complete online training telling them to "try to be less white." </p>
<p>These images are from an internal whistleblower: <a href="https://t.co/gRi4N20esZ">pic.twitter.com/gRi4N20esZ</a></p>

<p>Since then, mainstream media and left-wing outlets had largely avoided the hot topic. However, Blaze Public Relations’ Chris Pandolfo obtained a statement from Coca-Cola that concedes its employees were told to take the seminar in question.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement from <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a>: <a href="https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz">https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz</a> <a href="https://t.co/DBIpsj5706">pic.twitter.com/DBIpsj5706</a></p>
<p>— Chris Pandolfo (@ChrisCPandolfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCPandolfo/status/1362969629543522307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“The video circulating on social media is from a publicly available LinkedIn Learning series and is not a focus of our company’s curriculum,” Coca-Cola responded.</p>
<p>“Our Better Together global learning curriculum is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace.”</p>
<p>“It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long. The training includes access to LinkedIn Learning on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will continue to refine this curriculum.”</p>
<p>It is important to note this wording concedes it <em>happened</em>. Furthermore, it is not “inclusive” to attack particular individuals’ racial background; that is, by definition, “exclusive.”</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Learning class, called “Confronting Racism, with Robin DiAngelo,” is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/confronting-racism-with-robin-diangelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">administered online.</a> DiAngelo, who has become famous for her infamous book “White Fragility,” has become somewhat of a celebrity by holding corporate struggle sessions on critical race theory. This has entailed charging <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to $40,000</a> for half-day indoctrination courses to lecture audiences on the imagined perils of “whiteness” and “white fragility.<em>“</em></p>
<p>The prior description of the course included language that instructed people to be “less white.” We are not talking about a bug, but a feature of the lecture.</p>
<div>
<p>The course description said it will cover <em>“</em>understanding what it means to be white,” and “challenging what it means to be racist.” Students were instructed “to be less white is to: be less oppressive; be less arrogant; be less certain; be less defensive; be less ignorant; be more humble; listen; believe; break with apathy;” and “break with white solidarity.”</p>
<p>Author and pundit Candace Owens reacted to the revelation:</p>
</div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people how to “be less black”, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow. </p>
<p>I genuinely hope these employees sue <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a> for blatant racism and discrimination. <a href="https://t.co/07OPZouEcV">https://t.co/07OPZouEcV</a></p>
<p>— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1362862767481446406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people to ‘be less black’, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow,” Owens tweeted. “I genuinely hope these employees sue Coca-Cola for blatant racism and discrimination.”</p>
<p>“Your job at Coca-Cola should not depend on whether or not you buy into the idea of being less white,” Borysenko remarked. “It should depend on whether or not you can go in and do your job.” The organizational psychologist also walked viewers through what it all means on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWfS0SmNqw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Youtube video</a>.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is undoubtedly not the only company that has tapped DiAngelo and similar speakers, such as Ta-Nehisi Coates, to lead such trainings. Corporate social re-engineering efforts like diversity trainings are themselves big business. As the Free Beacon <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/">noted</a>, “the Diversity and Inclusion business was thought to be worth <a href="https://time.com/5696943/diversity-business/">$8 billion</a>&nbsp;as of 2003; by 2005,&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/an2018.pdf">65 percent</a> of big companies offered diversity training.”</p>
<p>Even more strikingly, the Free Beacon points out, there is little-to-no evidence that anti-bias trainings work:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5186d08fe4b065e39b45b91e/t/51e3234ce4b0c8784c9e4aae/1373840204345/Paluck_Green_AnnRev_2009.pdf">A review</a>&nbsp;of nearly 1,000 studies of anti-bias tools found little evidence that they have any impact. In fact, recent studies suggest anti-bias training’s primary effect may be to encourage discrimination: Firms with diversity training&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail">end up with</a>&nbsp;fewer minorities in management, and field research&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/dobbin_-_aatraining_clean.pdf#page=11">finds</a>&nbsp;that training both reinforces stereotypes and increases animosity against minority groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be that these “inclusion” seminars actually work the opposite of how they are intended: Instead of bringing people together, they raise awareness of our superficial differences and drive us further apart.</p>

February 20, 2021 | https://www.redahmeid.com/blog/just-say-no-to-versioning | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.redahmeid.com/blog/just-say-no-to-versioning">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-1dc2839754afdb686fff"><div><p>I don’t think it is giving away too much to say that I believe we should never version our APIs. I also know that as a concept, non-versioning is controversial. Interestingly, the disagreement in approaches usually, in my experience, is due to a fundamental core principle agreed upon by all. And that is, producers of APIs should not break consumers of APIs through change.</p><p>I think that is an excellent basis to start a conversation. My approach to debates is to find common ground as early into the discussion as possible and build from there. Therefore, let’s define that principle again more clearly.</p><blockquote><p><strong>API consumers expect never to be broken by a change in the API they consume.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I am sure that readers will in no way be surprised to learn that I am not the first to push the idea of no versioning. The concept has been around for many years. And yet, it’s still controversial. Roy Fielding, the man who wrote a thesis describing RESTFul APIs and introduced to the world the concept of HATEOAS (though the thesis never uses the weird acronym), is exact on the subject.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612171787005_4817"><div><p>Fielding talks about this in the context of REST APIs with a be damned if you go for non-REST attitude. In my opinion, REST is an elegant architectural style that does make building evolvable APIs easy, without succumbing to versioning. This post isn’t a place for detailing REST; there are plenty of better resources out there for that. But suffice to say using RESTFul principles for API design is probably a strong starting position.</p><p>However, REST is not the only solution, and good API design can overcome versioning. </p><p>Producers of APIs have broadly taken two approaches to not breaking consumers. The most common practice, and the one that is mostly considered the standard, is to version their APIs, usually deprecating the older versions and encouraging consumers to migrate. There are multiple ways taken of describing the version in the request. The most visible (and probably the one most organisations default to) is in the URL. Others will pass the version via the Accept header in the request. You will likely come across several resources that suggest this is best practice.&nbsp;</p><p>API versioning has downsides, irrespective of the patterns used. For one thing, supporting one version of anything is a pain. Finding a bug in one version necessitates affirmation that it doesn’t exist in other versions. If it does, there are a couple of options. Fix it in all versions, proportionally increasing the amount of testing needed. Or fix it in the latest version only and inform consumers that they need to move versions. And if it only exists in one place, should consumers move to a version without the bug (say the latest), or does a superseded version need fixing?</p><p>Some patterns minimise the pain of versioning. Advocates will argue that the concerns I raise are resolvable. And they are. And they have been resolved—however, it is fixing a self-inflicted issue. No versioning removes those worries. And for the consumer of your APIs, they benefit equally; they don’t need to change, are not broken by changes to the API, always have the latest functionality, and the documentation they need to read is minimal.</p><p>Let me backtrack slightly from my first sentence in this post. I believe versioning is unnecessary as I have yet to come across a situation in API design and development that needed versioning. I have yet to be convinced in practice that versioning is a necessity or even preferable. Below is the sort of conversation I have when suggesting we shouldn’t version.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What if we need to add a new mandatory field in the request?</strong></p><p>If it really is a “mandatory” field, why do you have a version of the API that doesn’t require it?</p><p><strong>We need it to carry out some new business logic?</strong></p><p>OK, a few things are going on here that we should talk through.</p><p>Again, this should not be described as a mandatory field or mandatory new business logic. If you support a version of the API that doesn’t need it, you support business functionality that doesn’t need it. At best, this is an optional field that may change the path your code goes down. Or if it is truly mandatory, why support a version that doesn’t include it?</p><p>Make the API contract as simple as possible by only requiring inputs that you have no way of working out yourselves. Make the internal workings of the API do the complex stuff, not forcing the consumer to do it. That way the contract can remain simple and your business logic and API avoid the brittleness caused by mandatory change.</p><p><strong>We made a spelling mistake in the field name, or we’re changing the style of fields. If we change the field names, it will break the consumers.</strong></p><p>So don’t change the field name. Consumers are using it fine. A colleague once pointed me in the direction of the HTTP header Referer. This is misspelt. There has been no suggestion that this should be corrected, as it was already in use. The same with API fields. If it is not harming, leave it.</p><p>However, if you really want to change the spelling, support both spellings. Maybe only document the new one but don’t break if the old spelling was used. Add a fitness function that indicates the trend in use of the old spelling vs the new. If the usage of the old spelling drops to a certain level, maybe then make a concerted effort to move the remaining clients across but highighting that you’ll stop supporting the old spelling.</p><p>But I go back to my first advice. Don’t bother changing the spelling. </p><p><strong>We want to change the structure of our response.</strong></p><p>This is an interesting one which I would usually dig a little deeper into. But I would start with why do you need to change the structure? I am sure you do but articulating why may help in designing it in a non-breaking way.</p><p>If necessary, consider content negotiation, where a consumer includes in the Accept header the media type they expect. If the structure is significantly different, maybe it isn’t a new version of the API, just a new representation of the resource that the API returns. </p><p>As with the above, handle the change internally, not force consumers to change.</p><p><strong>It’s not just a different structure, the response looks very different</strong></p><p>Roy Fielding points out during his discussions on versioning that if the API is so different that you need to version, maybe it isn’t a different version of the API -maybe it is a completely different API.</p><p><strong>Github version their APIs</strong></p><p>I think Github do APIs really well. If you used them as your exemplar, you wouldn’t go far wrong. Github is on version 4 of their APIs. How do I reconcile the two views (i.e. GitHub are good, don’t do versioning)?</p><p>I could start by restating that phrase. Github is <span>only</span> on version 4 of their APIs after 13 years. That is one new version every 3 (and a bit) years. But still, it is a new version.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to note is that they versioned all their APIs at the same time. Not individual versioning. And there is a reason for that. The move from version 3 to version 4 was a move from REST APIs to GraphQL. They didn’t version the APIs. They versioned their architectural style.</p><p>While I am not privy to the thinking behind this, if you visit the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en">Github docs home page</a> they do not talk about version 3 and version 4 of their APIs, but the REST APIs and GraphQL APIs. I’d suggest this is further evidence they see this as a change of architectural style. Maybe, and now I am guessing, the version number is an easy way to differentiate in the URL or indicates the direction of travel they intend to take. Either way, I would strongly suggest they don’t version APIs but simply architecture. And if there were a valid reason to use versioning, this is it.</p></blockquote><p>The above is a sanitised conversation, and readers will likely identify other scenarios requiring versioning, which I would love to hear about in the comments.  I’m even happy to work with people on the design. I don’t want this to seem like a straight forward thing to do, especially if you do not start from a solid API design base. When you consider versioning as an option, take into account the following:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Make all changes to response or request optional rather than mandatory.</p></li><li><p>If they are mandatory changes, why do you support a version that doesn’t have those changes? </p></li><li><p>Keep the API contract as simple as possible. Limit the number of input requirements to what is absolutely necessary to make the system work. Any business logic inputs should be retrieved from internal sources as much as possible. By making the API do the work, changes to the contract will be rare.</p></li><li><p>Would the change to the API benefit every consumer? If not, think about how impactful the change is for consumers who don’t need it?</p></li><li><p>Would you support every version forever? Or will you start to decommission versions and force consumers to move across?</p></li><li><p>Is the change due to new business logic? If so, will the new business logic be part of every version?</p></li><li><p>If the change is due to new business logic, should that even be a concern for your consumers?</p></li><li><p>Does a new version make things easier or more challenging for the consumers of your APIs?</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, ask yourself one question if the case for versioning seems strong; “does the benefit of this change justify the time, effort and impact of supporting multiple versions, to our consumers and us?”. The success of your APIs is in making them easy to consume. That should include not forcing the consumer to change. Rethink the approach to anything that makes API consumption more difficult. Do the hard work at the design stage, and hopefully, you’ll have easy to use, evolvable APIs that will be maintainable and keeps everyone happy.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Chemical recycling, in contrast, involves breaking down the long polymer chains of plastic with heat or solvents to retrieve the material's initial monomer components.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the obstacles to developing chemical-recycling technology is also a reason why plastic is a useful material: the strong carbon-carbon bonds in its molecular structure. Polyethylene, the most common kind of plastic, requires at least 600 degrees Celsius to break those bonds to retrieve the monomers, and is chemically recycled at a rate lower than 10%.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œStability of the hydrocarbon chains is rather a problem in that case,â€� said Stefan Mecking, the lead author of the study and the department chair of chemical materials science at the University of Konstanz in Germany. â€œTo really break them down into small molecules needs high temperatures and is energy intensive, and also the yields are not that good.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The plastic compounds created by Mecking and his colleagues had chemical bonds that could be more easily broken so chemically recycling them would be more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">Chemically recycling the two materials, which were forms of polyester and polycarbonate, required placing them in ethanol or methanol with a catalyst at only 120 degrees Celsius, or 150 degrees without the catalyst. The researchers then cooled and recrystallized the plastic before filtering it out. In the case of the polycarbonate, 96% of the initial material was recovered.</p><p dir="ltr">As demand in the recycling industry stalls and recyclable materials pile up in warehouses and landfills, chemical recycling has been offered as part of a solution to reduce plastic waste. The industry group American Chemistry Council has <a href="https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/what-is-advanced-recycling/">praised</a> the emerging technology for the significant role it could play in a circular economy by reducing plastic waste and repurposing it into new products.</p><p>Yet the method is not without pushback. A <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/CR-Technical-Assessment_June-2020.pdf">2020 report</a> by the environmental organization Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives criticized a lack of research and reporting in current chemical-recycling technologies and said the process is energy-intensive and may emit hazardous chemicals. Chemical recycling also distracts from efforts to limit plastic production to reduce waste, the organization said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the new research, the chemists found that the recycling process worked when the plastic contained dye or fillers such as carbon fibers, both of which cause challenges in mechanical recycling. The plastics were also successfully recovered when pieces of other plastics were included in the alcohol solvent.</p><p dir="ltr">Plant oils were chosen as starting materials for synthesizing the plastics primarily because of their useful long chains. They are also more sustainably sourced than the crude oil and other fossil fuels used to produce most of the worldâ€™s plastic material.</p><p dir="ltr">The new plastics were very similar to high-density polyethylene, the widely used plastic labeled as recycling number . Testing by the chemists found that the three materials had comparable properties such as structure, elasticity and molecular weights â€” though the polycarbonate and polyester had lower melting and crystallization points.</p><p dir="ltr">They were also better suited for 3D printing than polyethylene, and they retained their properties after recycling and reuse.</p><p dir="ltr">The one disadvantage of the new materials Mecking identified was their cost. Ethylene is the â€œcheapest building block of the chemical industry,â€� he said, so, "Competing with conventional polyethylene at the current market and legal framework conditions is very difficult.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Mecking and his colleagues are conducting ongoing research into using their new plastics for 3D printing, an initial application he said would be exciting for further developing the material and eventually scaling up its production.</p><p dir="ltr">These new plastics may also biodegrade in nature more quickly than common polymers because of their engineered break points, a line of inquiry that also interests the German chemist.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The article, â€œClosed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials,â€� was published Feb. 17 in Nature.Â&nbsp;</em><em>The authors of the study were Manuel , Marcel Eck, Dario Rothauer and Stefan Mecking, University of Konstanz.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<p>For those who don't follow Swift's development, ABI stability has been one of its most ambitious projects and possibly it's defining feature, <a href="https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-more/">and it finally shipped in Swift 5</a>. The result is something I find endlessly fascinating, because I think Swift has pushed the notion of ABI stability farther than any language without much compromise.</p>
<p>So I decided to write up a bunch of the interesting high-level details of Swift's ABI. This <strong>is not</strong> a complete reference for Swift's ABI, but rather an abstract look at its implementation strategy. If you really want to know exactly how it allocates registers or mangles names, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>Also for context on why I'm writing this, I'm just naturally inclined to compare the design of Swift to Rust, because those are the two languages I have helped develop. Also some folks like to complain that Rust doesn't bother with ABI stability, and I think looking at how Swift <em>does</em> helps elucidate why that is.</p>
<p>This article is broken up into two sections: background and details. Feel free to skip to the details if you're very comfortable with the problems inherent to producing a robust dynamically linked system interface.</p>
<p>If you aren't comfortable with the basic concepts of type layouts, ABIs, and calling conventions, I recommend reading the article I wrote on <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/">the basic concepts of type layout and ABI as they pertain to Rust</a>.</p>
<p>Also huge thanks to the Swift devs for answering all of the questions I had and correcting my misunderstandings!</p>

<p>I know a lot of people don't really follow Swift, and it can be hard to understand what they've really accomplished without some context of what the language is like, so here's a TL;DR of the language's shape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exists to replace Objective-C on Apple's platforms, oriented at application development
<ul>
<li>natively interoperates with Objective-C</li>
<li>has actual classes and inheritance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At a distance, very similar to Rust (but "higher-level")
<ul>
<li>interfaces, generics, closures, enums with payloads, unsafe escape hatch</li>
<li>no lifetimes; Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) used for complex cases</li>
<li>simple function-scoped mutable borrows (inout)</li>
<li>Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on "value semantics"
<ul>
<li>structs/primitives ("values") are "mutable xor shared", stored inline</li>
<li>collections implement value semantics by being Copy-On-Write (CoW) (using ARC)</li>
<li>classes are mutably shared and boxed (using ARC), undermining value semantics (can even cause data races)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on things Just Working
<ul>
<li>language may freely allocate to make things Work</li>
<li>generic code may be polymorphically compiled</li>
<li>fields may secretly be getter-setter pairs</li>
<li>ARC and CoW can easily result in surprising performance cliffs</li>
<li>tons of overloading and syntactic sugar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry about fully understanding all of these, we'll dig into the really important ones and their implications as we go on.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking"><a href="#what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking">1.2 What Is ABI Stability and Dynamic Linking</a></h2>
<p>When the Swift developers talk about "ABI Stability" they have exactly one thing in mind: they want native system APIs for MacOS and iOS to be written in Swift, and for you to dynamically link to them. This includes dynamically linking to a single system-wide copy of the Swift Standard Library.</p>
<p>Ok so what's dynamic linking? For our purposes it's a system where you can compile an application against some abstract <em>description</em> of an interface without providing an actual implementation of it. This produces an application that on its own will not work properly, as part of its implementation is missing.</p>
<p>To run properly, it must tell the system's <em>dynamic linker</em> about all of the interfaces it needs implementations for, which we call <em>dynamic libraries</em> (dylibs). Assuming everything goes right, those implementations get hooked up to the application and everything Just Works.</p>
<p>Dynamic linking is very important to system APIs because it's what allows the system's implementation to be updated without also rebuilding all the applications that run on it. The applications don't care about what implementation they get, as long as it conforms to the interface they were built against.</p>
<p>It can also significantly reduce a system's memory footprint by making every application share the same implementation of a library (Apple cares about this a lot on its mobile devices).</p>
<p>Since Swift is AOT compiled, the application and the dylib both have to make a bunch of assumptions on how to communicate with the other side long before they're linked together. These assumptions are what we call ABI (an Application's <em>Binary</em> Interface), and since it needs to be consistent over a long period of time, that ABI better be stable.</p>
<p>So dynamic linking is our goal, and ABI stability is just a means to that end.</p>
<p>For our purposes, an ABI can be regarded as 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#layout">The layout of types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#calling-conventions">The calling convention of functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">The names of symbols</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can define these details and never break them, you have a stable ABI, and dynamic linking can be performed. (Ignoring trivial cases where both the dylib and application were built together and ABI stability is irrelevant.)</p>
<p>Now to be clear, ABI stability isn't technically a property of a programming language. It's really a property of a system and its toolchain. To understand this, let's look at history's greatest champion of ABI stability and dynamic linking: C.</p>
<p>All the major OSes make use of C for their dynamically linked system APIs. From this we can conclude that C "has" a stable ABI. But here's the catch: if you compile some C code for dynamic linking on Ubuntu, that compiled artifact won't work on MacOS or Windows. Heck, even if you compile it for 64-bit Windows it won't work on 32-bit Windows!</p>
<p>Why? Because ABI is something defined by the <em>platform</em>. It's not even something that necessarily needs to be documented. The platform vendor can just require you to use a particular compiler toolchain that happens to implement their stable ABI.</p>
<p>(As it turns out, this is actually the reality of Swift's Stabilized ABIs on Apple platforms. They're not actually properly documented, xcode just implements it and the devs will do their best not to break it. They're not opposed to documenting it, it's just a lot of work and shipping was understandably higher-priority. Thankfully I don't really care about the details, or the difference between the ABIs on MacOS and iOS, or implementations other than Apple's, so I can keep saying "Swift's ABI" and it won't be a problem.)</p>
<p>But if that's the case, why don't platform vendors provide stable ABIs for lots of other languages? Well it turns out that the language isn't completely irrelevant here. Although ABI isn't "part" of C itself, it <em>is</em> relatively friendly to the concept. Many other languages aren't.</p>
<p>To understand why C is friendly to ABI stability, let's look at its much less friendly big brother, C++.</p>
<p>Templated C++ functions cannot have their implementations dynamically linked. If I provide you with a system header that provides the following declaration, you simply can't use it:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
bool process(T value);
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <em>it has no symbol</em>. C++ templates are monomorphically compiled, which is a fancy way of saying that the way to use them is to copy-paste the implementation with all the templates replaced with a particular value.</p>
<p>So if I want to call <code>process&lt;int&gt;(0)</code>, I need to have the implementation available to copy-paste it with <code>int</code> replacing <code>T</code>. Needing to have the implementation available at compile-time completely undermines the concept of dynamic linking.</p>
<p>Now perhaps the platform could make a promise that it has precompiled several monomorphic instances, so say symbols for <code>process&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>process&lt;bool&gt;</code> are available. You could make that work, but then the function wouldn't really be meaningfully templated anymore, as only those two explicitly blessed substitutions would be valid.</p>
<p>There would be little difference from simply providing a header containing:</p>
<pre><code>bool process(int value);
bool process(bool value);
</code></pre>
<p>Now a header <em>could</em> just include the template's implementation, but what that would really be guaranteeing is that that particular implementation will <em>always</em> be valid. Future versions of the header could introduce new implementations, but a robust system would have to assume applications could using either, or perhaps even both at the same time.</p>
<p>This is no different from a C macro or <code>inline</code> function, but I think it's fair to say that templates are a little more important in C++.</p>
<p>For comparison, most platforms provide a dynamically linked version of the C standard library, and everyone uses it. On the other hand, C++'s standard library isn't very useful to dynamically link to; it's literally called the Standard <em>Template</em> Library!</p>
<p>In spite of this issue (and many others), C++ <em>can</em> be dynamically linked and used in an ABI-stable way! It's just that it ends up looking a lot more like a C interface due to the limitations.</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust is similarly hostile to dynamic linking (it also uses monomorphization), and so an ABI-stable Rust would also end up only really supporting C-like interfaces. Rust has largely just embraced that fact, focusing its attention on other concerns.</p>

<p>I have now made some seemingly contradictory claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swift has similar features to Rust</li>
<li>Rust's features make it hostile to dynamic linking</li>
<li>Swift is great at dynamic linking</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret lies in where the two languages diverge: dynamism. Rust is a <em>very</em> static and explicit language, reflecting the sensibilities of its developers and early adopters. Swift's developers preferred a much more dynamic and implicit design, and so that's what they made.</p>
<p>As it turns out, hiding implementation details and doing more work at runtime is <em>really</em> friendly to dynamic linking. Who'd've …</p></div></div>

<p>The scores that matter will be the ones you’ve created, that measure your progress to your own goals.</p>



<p>For example, I ran a <a href="https://www.cubcamp.org/">Cub Scout day camp</a> for four years. Wanting to have maximum positive effect on the community, I have a “go big or go home” approach to Scouting. I rated myself in part on how well the camp recruited participants. That is a score I made for myself. It helped us set new records.</p>

<h2>Focus for success</h2>



<p>If website scores end up being good, that’s fine! But make sure those great scores are merely incidental. They should not be your goal.</p>



<p>Focus on scores that matter. They will be the ones you created. They will help you know your path to your goals.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the second in a three-part series about
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>.
In the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">first post</a>, I
described the context around Cranelift and our project to replace its
backend code-generation infrastructure, and detailed the
instruction-selection problem and how we solve it. The remaining two
posts will be deep-dives into some interesting engineering problems.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to dive into the <em>compiler performance</em> aspect of
our work more deeply. (In the next post we’ll explore correctness.)
There are many interesting aspects of compilation speed I could talk
about, but one particularly difficult problem is the handling of
<em>control flow</em>: how do we translate structured control flow at the
Wasm level into control-flow graphs at the IR level, and finally to
branches in a linear stream of instructions at the machine-code level?</p>

<p>Doing this translation efficiently requires careful attention to the
overall pass structure, with the largest wins coming when one can
completely eliminate a category of work. We’ll see this in how we
combine several passes in a traditional lowering design (critical-edge
splitting, block ordering, redundant-block elimination, branch
relaxation, branch target resolution) into <em>inline transforms</em> that
happen during other passes (lowering of the CLIF, or Cranelift IR,
into machine-specific IR; and later, binary emission).</p>

<p>This post basically describes the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/buffer.rs"><code>MachBuffer</code></a>,
a “smart machine-code buffer” that knows about branches and edits them
on-the-fly as we emit them, and the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/blockorder.rs"><code>BlockLoweringOrder</code></a>,
which allows us to lower code in final basic-block order, with split
critical edges inserted implicitly, by traversing a never-materialized
implicit graph. The work was done mostly in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1718">Cranelift PR
#1718</a>, which
resulted in a ~10% compile-time improvement and a ~25%
compile+run-time improvement on a CPU-intensive benchmark (<code>bz2</code>).</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-graphs">Control-Flow Graphs</h2>

<p>Before we discuss any of that, we need to review control-flow graphs
(CFGs)! The CFG is a fundamental data structure used in almost all
modern compilers. In brief, it represents how execution (i.e., program
control) may flow through instructions, using graph nodes to represent
linear sequences of instructions and graph edges to represent all
possible control-flow transfers at branch instructions.</p>

<p>At the end of the instruction selection process, which we learned
about in the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">previous post</a>, we have a function body lowered into VCode that consists of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"><em>basic blocks</em></a>. A basic
block is a contiguous sequence of instructions that has no outbound
branches except at the end, and has no inbound branches except at the
beginning. In other words, it is “straight-line” code: execution
always starts at the top and proceeds to the end. An example
control-flow graph (CFG) consisting of four basic blocks is shown
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-10-08-cfg-web.svg" alt="Figure: Control-flow graph with four basic blocks in a diamond"></p>

<p>Control-flow graphs are excellent data structures for compilers to
use. By making the flow of execution explicit as graph edges, rather
than reasoning about instructions in order in memory as the processor
sees them, many analyses can be performed more easily. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow analysis</a>
problems can be solved easily because the CFG makes traversal of
possible control-flow transfers easy. Graph-based representations of
the program also allow easier <em>moving and insertion of code</em>: it is
less error-prone to manipulate an explicit graph than to reason about
implicit control-flow (e.g. fallthrough from a not-taken conditional
branch). Finally, the graph representation factors out the question of
<em>block ordering</em>, which can be important for performance; we can
address this problem separately by choosing how we serialize the graph
nodes (blocks). For these reasons, most compiler IRs, including
Cranelift’s CLIF and <code>VCode</code>, are CFG-based.</p>

<p>(Historical note: control-flow graphs were invented by the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Allen">Frances Allen</a>, who
largely established the algorithmic foundations that modern compilers
use. Her paper <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp512/Lectures/Papers/1971-allen-catalog.pdf">A catalogue of optimizing
transformations</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
covers essentially all of the important optimizations used today and
is well worth a read.)</p>

<h2 id="cpus-and-branch-instructions">CPUs and Branch Instructions</h2>

<p>To represent a CFG’s end-of-block branches at the instruction level,
we can use <em>two-way branches</em>: these are instructions that branch
either to one basic-block target if some condition is true, or another
if the condition is false. (Basic blocks can also end in simple
unconditional single-target branches.) We wrote such a branch as <code>if
r0, L1, L2</code> above; this means that the block <code>L0</code> will be followed in
execution either by <code>L1</code> or <code>L2</code>, depending on the value in <code>r0</code>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="branches-with-fallthrough">Branches with Fallthrough</h3>

<p>However, CPUs rarely have such two-way branch instructions. Instead,
conditional control-flow in common ISAs is almost always provided with
a <em>conditional branch with fallthrough</em>. This is an instruction that,
if some condition is true, branches to another location; otherwise,
does nothing, and allows execution to continue sequentially. This is a
better fit for a hardware implementation for a number of reasons: it’s
easier to encode one target than two (the destination of the jump
might be quite far away for some branches, and instructions have
limited bits available), and it’s usually the case that the compiler
can place one of the successor blocks immediately afterward anyway.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t much of a problem if we just want a working compiler;
instead of a two-way branch</p>



<p>We can write a sequence of branches</p>



<p>where <code>br_if</code> branches to <code>L1</code> or falls through to the unconditional
<code>goto</code>. But this is not so efficient in many cases. Consider what
would happen if we laid out basic blocks in the order <code>L0</code>, <code>L2</code>,
<code>L1</code>, <code>L3</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      goto L2
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      goto L3
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two redundant unconditional branches (<code>goto</code> instructions),
each of which uselessly branches to the following instruction. We can
remove both of them with no ill effects, taking advantage instead of
<em>fallthrough</em>, or allowing execution to proceed directly from the end
of one block to the start of the next one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      // ** Otherwise, fall through to L2 **
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      // ** Always fall through to L3 **
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems like an easy enough problem to solve: we just need to
recognize when a branch is redundant and remove it, right? Well, yes,
but we can do much better than that in some cases; we’ll dig into this
problem in significantly more depth below!</p>

<h3 id="machine-code-encoding-branch-offsets">Machine-code Encoding: Branch Offsets</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve written our machine instructions in a way that humans
can read, using <em>labels</em> to refer to locations in the instruction
stream. At the hardware level, however, these labels do not exist;
instead, the machine code branches contain target <em>addresses</em> (usually
encoded as relative <em>offsets</em> from the branch instruction). In other
words, we do not see <code>goto L3</code>, but rather <code>goto +32</code>.</p>

<p>This gives rise to several complications when emitting machine code
from a list of instruction <code>struct</code>s.  At the most basic level, we
have to resolve labels to offsets and then patch the branches
appropriately. This is analogous to (but at a lower level than) the
job of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a>:
we resolve symbols to concrete values after deciding placement, and
then edit the code according to <em>relocations</em> to refer to those
symbols. In other words, whenever we emit a branch, we make a note (a
relocation, or “label use” in our <code>MachBackend</code>) to go back later and
patch it with the resolved label offset.</p>

<p>The second, and more interesting, problem arises because not all
branch instructions can necessarily refer to all possible labels! As a
concrete example, on AArch64, conditional branches have a ±1 MB range,
and unconditional branches have a ±128 MB range. This arises out of
instruction-encoding considerations: particularly in
fixed-instruction-size ISAs (such as ARM, MIPS, and RISC V), less than
a full machine word of bits are available for the immediate jump
offset that is embedded in the instruction word. (The instruction
itself is always a machine-word wide, and we need some bits for the
opcode and condition code too!) On x86, we have limits for a different
reason: the variable-width encoding allows either a one-byte offset
(allowing a ±128 byte range) or four-byte offset (allowing a ±2 GB
range).</p>

<p>To make a branch to a far-off label, then, on some machines we need to
either use a different sort of branch than the default choice for the
instruction selector, or we need to use a form of <em>indirection</em>, by
targetting the original branch to <em>another branch</em>, the latter in a
special form. The former is tricky because we do not know whether a
target will be in-range until all code is lowered and placement is
computed; so we need to either optimistically or pessimistically lower
branches to the shortest or longest form (respectively) and possibly
switch later. To make matters worse, as we edit branches to use a
shorter or longer form, their length may change, moving <em>other</em>
targets into or out of range; in the most general solution, this is a
“fixpoint problem”, where we iterate until no more changes occur.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-lowering-cfgs-to-machine-code">Challenges in Lowering CFGs to Machine Code</h2>

<p>So far, we have a way to produce <em>correct</em> machine code. To emit the
final code for a two-target branch, we can emit a conditional-
followed by unconditional-branch machine instruction. To resolve
branch targets correctly, we can assume that any target could be
anywhere in memory, and always use the long form of a branch; then we
just need to come back in one final pass and fill in the offsets when
we know them.</p>

<p>We can do much better than this, though! Below I’ll describe four
problems and the ways that they are traditionally solved.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-efficient-use-of-fallthroughs">Problem 1: Efficient use of Fallthroughs</h3>

<p>We described above how <em>branch fallthroughs</em> allow us to omit some
some unconditional branches once we know for sure the order that basic
blocks will appear in the final binary. In …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<section id="full_content">
    <p><strong>Microsoft</strong> founder Bill Gates just slammed cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. He <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-interview-advice-quotes-decisions-11613654671">said</a>, “It’d be good to get rid of that” while highlighting how cryptocurrency “allows for certain criminal activities” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>With this, Gates joined the legendary investors and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> CEO Warren Buffett — who has publicly expressed his hatred for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past. Before I discuss why the cryptocurrency market is extremely risky for small investors with a low-risk appetite, let’s explore what Gates and Buffett have to say about it.</p>
<h2>Bill Gates slams Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Gates is currently the world’s third wealthiest person. Bloomberg billionaires index estimates his net wealth to be around US$137 billion. In another <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1362405700878614532">interview</a> with CNBC on Thursday, Gates revealed neither he doesn’t have any Bitcoin position — long or short. Last year, Buffett also criticized cryptocurrency calling it worthless. Back then, he clarified that he would never invest in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In his latest interview, Gates showered prases on <strong>Tesla</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-tsla-tesla-motors/737/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:TSLA)</a> CEO Elon Musk. He <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/bill-gates-says-we-need-more-elon-musks-to-tackle-climate-change.html">believes</a> “What Elon’s done with Tesla is fantastic,” calling it “…the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are part of how we solve climate change,” adding, “We need a lot of Elon Musks” and “he should be very proud of what he’s done.”</p>
<h2>Tesla’s big Bitcoin bets</h2>
<p>Tesla and its latest annual filing last week revealed that it <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-bitcoin-is-dogecoin-next-for-elon-musk/">invested US$1.5 billion in Bitcoin</a>. The company also plans to start accepting Bitcoin as payment for its products soon. Tesla — which is now a part of the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> — made its surprising Bitcoin purchase in January. As a result, investors who now own Tesla stock or S&amp;P 500 funds indirectly have stakes in the cryptocurrency market — whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>After Tesla’s big bets on Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market has recently seen a massive jump in its trade volume. Not many small investors know that the extremely volatile cryptocurrency market can ruin their years of saving in no time. The fact is you don’t need to buy Bitcoin to multiply your savings in the long term. You can do it the way Warren Buffett does it without taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<h2>Invest money the Warren Buffett way</h2>
<p>Buffett has made money consistently for decades from the stock market. He simply believes in buying good cheap stocks for the long-term to grow money. Buffett also prefers to invest his money in industries that have good future growth potential.</p>
<p>The demand for electric cars has surged in the last few years. Industry experts predict the 2020s to be the decade of electric and autonomous cars. That’s the reason even big tech companies like <strong>Apple</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-aapl-apple/82/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:AAPL)</a> are ready to jump into the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker has secretly been working on its car project for years. It has poached many engineers and auto industry experts from many companies — including Tesla — lately. So, it shouldn’t surprise you if you see Apple launching its branded electric and autonomous car in the coming years.</p>
<h2>One great EV stock to buy today</h2>
<p>That’s why I expect businesses focused on electric and autonomous car technology to witness a massive growth in the coming years. For example, <strong>BlackBerry</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-bb-blackberry/174/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:BB)</a><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-bb-blackberry/176/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:BB)</a> has been my favorite Canadian tech company with its increasing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicle-related technology.</p>
<p>The company recently partnered with <strong>Amazon</strong> Web services to develop its integrated vehicle data platform. The platform would allow automakers to access and utilize vehicle sensor data in real-time. BlackBerry is also expanding its market share in China — the world’s largest car market. The company’s QNX Neutrino operating system — in partnership with <strong>Baidu</strong> — will soon be used in mass-produced EVs in the country.</p>
<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market — at first — may look like an easy way to get rich. However, most retail investors with a small risk appetite tend to lose their money in cryptocurrency trading. That’s why it’s better to follow Buffett and stick to cheap high-growth stocks to multiply your hard-earned money.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
	The trillion-dollar market value has a new member: bitcoin. The total number of bitcoins trading are now collectively worth more than US$1 trillion.</p>
<p>
	That's because the price of a bitcoin hit a number of new all-time highs Friday. One bitcoin currently costs nearly $53,400 -- and there are about 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation according to Coinbase. (The total number of bitcoin eventually available is capped at 21 million.)</p>
<p>
	Of course, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison to look at bitcoin versus big firms with sky-high valuations like Apple. But for what it's worth, only four companies in the United States currently are worth more than bitcoin: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google owner Alphabet.</p>
<p>
	Bitcoin currently is worth about $225 billion more than Tesla, the company that is most responsible for the most recent surge in the cryptocurrency's price.</p>
<p>
	The Elon Musk-led electric car juggernaut announced earlier this month that it now owns $1.5 billion's worth of bitcoin in its corporate coffers. Tesla also said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.</p>
<p>
	That news has sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrncies to their balance sheets, since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash.</p>
<p>
	Corporate America is validating bitcoin. Payments giants Square and PayPal let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa and Mastercard are also embracing cryprocurrencies.</p>
<p>
	And a top strategist at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said on CNBC this week that the company has "started to dabble" in bitcoin as an investment.</p>
<p>
	All this has helped spark a wave of buying by average investors. Consumer research firm Piplsay wrote in a report Thursday that half of the more than 30,000 consumers it surveyed this week about bitcoin said they felt it was "safe" to invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>
	Bitcoin prices have surged more than 80% so far this year, and investors are enthusiastically scooping up other cryptocurrencies as well. Ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency with a total value of about $220 billion, has more than doubled this year.</p>
<p>
	And the price of dogecoin, a currency that originally started as a dog meme-based joke, also has skyrocketed this year following several bullish tweets about it by Musk and support from traders on Reddit.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo is a search engine that gives us the chance to recapture our privacy. Yes, DuckDuckGo does not store or share any information on its user data which extends to search history, cookies, and IP addresses. Whenever we think about search engines, the first thing that comes to our mind is Google and we have a more powerful Google suite to make our life easy, but Google takes a lot of information from us. And they utilize it in a variety of different ways! As the privacy issue gets bigger and bigger; we could see government policies take control in the current situation. &nbsp;Therefore, the DuckDuckGo could be able to see its popularity spiral up now. DuckDuckGo was founded in 2008, and they had approximately 23.7 billion search queries on their platform in 2020, based on their <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traffic page</a>.</p>



<p>Due to the privacy policy, they do not have a record of the number of users those who are using the search engine, however as per CEO &amp; Founder at DuckDuckGo.com, “Since we do not track users, it’s impossible for us to know exactly how many users visit our site every month”, and yet according to their estimated guess the total comes to nearly 25 million people.</p>



<h2>What catches the privacy user with DuckDuckGo?</h2>



<ol><li>DuckDuckGo does not track you.</li><li>Not any search history backed up.</li><li>No Ads based on the user searches.</li><li>Cookies are not used by default.</li><li>Provides reasonable enough search results.</li><li>Well encrypted.</li></ol>



<h2>DuckDuckGo Versus Google</h2>



<figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png" alt="DuckDuckGo vs Google" srcset="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png 1024w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-300x169.png 300w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png 1024w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-300x169.png 300w, https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea-768x432.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.getbasicidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DuckDuckGo-GetBasicIdea.png"><figcaption>Comparison of DuckDuckGo and Google</figcaption></figure>



<h3>1. DuckDuckGo does not track you.</h3>



<p>As mentioned above Google traces everyone’s browsing history to offer more customized content. As a result, when a user goes to a website with Google’s advertising services, it sends information such as website URL, device’s IP address to Google and in return, Google provides the best results. On the other hand, <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> does not track users browsing at all. The browser also does not store any of the user data to serve them personally.</p>



<h3>2. Not any search history backed up.</h3>



<p>Google has a “Search History” option, which you can clear but it will be there, as evidence of what sites you visited. While DuckDuckGo search is anonymous, and as mentioned it does not track you, so each time you search something, your search history is not backed up anywhere.</p>



<h3>3. No Ads based on the user searches.</h3>



<p>When we search for something on Google, the first thing we come across is full of ads. However, this is not the same on DuckDuckGo. The search engine offers the least possible ads, and they are not providing ads based on your search, which will not on your profile or search history.</p>



<h3>4. Cookies are not used by default.</h3>



<p>Websites depend on cookies to keep users signed in. When you Fireproof a site, cookies will not be wiped out and you will remain signed in, even after using the fire button. DuckDuckGo does not save your data and it also has a feature that deletes all the data such as the recently visited site. However, this does not mean you will have to log in each time you open a website like Facebook in DuckDuckGo. It has a fireproof feature, in which the browser saves the login data of that site.</p>



<p>In Google, if you clear all the site data, you will get signed out from all the sites and there is no option to do that for a specific website.</p>



<h3>5. Provides reasonable enough search results.</h3>



<p>There might be a few disadvantages to completely cutting Google out of your life such as, Google search results are smarter than DuckDuckGo. and Google has it 91% market share under the most used search engine category. Still learning how to get the best search results can help you find what you want on the Internet without giving up personal information.</p>



<h3>6. Well encrypted.</h3>



<p>DuckDuckGo protects you from things like data breaches. The browser also has a feature described as "Smarter Encryption", which certifies more of your browsing will use encrypted connections (HTTPS). The way it works is they frequently maintain a list of sites that support encryption&nbsp; Google does not have any such feature and it shows all types of websites.</p>



<p>To sum up, the future of DuckDuckGo looks bright. They are always working on adding new features and opportunities to let their search engine users feel the quality of searching, at the same time protecting their privacy. They may have had a slow start, but when we think about their competition, they are getting ready for the battle and have set their brilliant goals already. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We can't take it anymore, raged Sonja Ultsch in a video on Facebook last week. "We've already let them slap us on the left cheek for Ischgl, now we have to turn our right cheek, too!" It was a reference to the Austrian ski town that was responsible for one of the biggest outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in Europe during the first wave last year.</p>


<div>
<p>As if in a commercial for pleasant skiing holidays, the hotelier filmed herself against a sunlit Alpine backdrop, railing against the Austrian government's efforts to seal off Tyrol because of a major outbreak of the South African B.1.351 virus mutant in the region. "I’ve had it, let them lock us in!” Ultsch railed, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses along with pink lipstick and light blond hair. "But then we’re going to open everything here!”</p><p>The defiant video went viral, and Ultsch certainly spoke from the heart of many a Tyrolean. And not only them. There is probably no country in the world where people aren’t fed up with the lockdown, which has transformed from an emergency measure to an entire new way of being. The frustration and suffering is growing louder because of the pandemic’s depressing and seemingly nonstop reign.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And ever since the virus mutants began spreading around the globe, even the last motivation for bravery is fading: the hope that the nightmare will soon end thanks to vaccination. Because as incredibly fast as it was possible to find and produce vaccines, the mutants were faster. And they are still faster.</p><p>For physicist and mathematician Michael Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig, one thing is clear: "Vaccination isn’t going to help us slow down the momentum of infections until the younger population has been immunized.” And what about higher temperatures in the spring and summer? It might help a bit, Meyer-Hermann thinks, when people start spending more time outside. "But that alone will in no way suffice.”</p>
</div>

<p>Meaning that the virus could continue to run rampant until enough people have been vaccinated.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p>In addition, the South African and Brazilian variants have some particularly nasty characteristics. For one, it’s likely they can re-infect people who have already suffered from an infection with the original coronavirus. And the vaccines also appear to be weaker against the new strains.</p><p>It’s like a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/can-germany-stop-the-new-supervirus-a-e9ffc207-0015-4330-8361-b306f6053e15" data-link-flag="english">whole new pandemic</a> has begun with the mutants. Things had been looking pretty good in Germany: The incidence rate was falling and continues to fall, and the measures seem to be working. But now, still invisible in the mountain of case numbers, the highly contagious mutants are spreading, most notably B.1.1.7, the virus variant that overran the United Kingdom in a matter orfweeks and led Portugal to have the highest incidence levels in the world. It will inevitably dominate infection trends in Germany, as well. The question is no longer whether the dangerous mutants will run rampant, only when.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This puts politicians in a bind. They are being forced to position themselves somewhere between two extremes, with one just as nightmarish as the other. On the one hand, you have the eternal lockdown, from which it is only ever possible to briefly emerge. On the other, by loosening up the measures, you risk giving the mutants free rein, which could push the case numbers in this country into the tens of thousands every day with many fatalities, including younger victims, people with long-term symptoms and constant series of new virus mutants.</p><p>Because this is also clear: High infection rates and increased numbers of people available for the virus to attack mean the virus can multiply freely. And with each replication, the likelihood increases of new mutations emerging. In most cases, more harmless, but also some more dangerous ones or even variations that are resistant to vaccines.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>What, then, is the country facing? It’s as if the pandemic has transported us into a weird state of limbo where people who are already pandemic-weary, frustrated and angry are granted a brief respite in which everything now depends on how they behave and decide to act.</p><p>It is possible to stop the mutant through a hard lockdown, as we are currently seeing in the UK and Ireland. But it is not possible to sustain that lockdown until a larger proportion of the population finally gets vaccinated in the summer or autumn. How much opening, then, is possible without the situation spinning out of control again? Scientists and politicians around the world are currently wrestling with that question. Last Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governors of the country’s 16 states debated the issue.</p><p>The federal government and the governors decided to extend the current lockdown until early March, with restrictions placed on social contacts, social distancing and bars. Restaurants have been ordered to stay closed until at least March 7. The only rule to be loosened is that hairdressers can open their doors to customers again at the beginning of March. The German states will decide on their own when to reopen schools.</p><p>Ultimately, the politicians had to yield, at least in part, to the findings of scientists worldwide who are rushing to do research on the new mutants. The calculations of epidemiologists, in particular, predict a disaster if a relaxation of rules were to take place now, even if it were at primary schools.</p><p>Still, that didn’t prevent individual governors from causing the usual local chaos in loosening the lockdown rules the day after the federal and state decisions were made. Just an example: On Saturday, flower shops were allowed to reopen in Lower Saxony. They were allowed to open in Bavaria on Sunday, too, but only because it was Valentine’s Day. On March 1, the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will allow garden centers, zoos and nail studios to reopen.</p><p>"The current measures aren’t even sufficient for stopping the exponential spread of the new variant,” says Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research. The physicist plugged all the basic assumptions available about the new variants into his models and calculated how they would affect the development of infections.</p><p>What he’s saying is that a third wave is coming.</p><p>Beyond Meyer-Hermann’s models, the figures from neighboring countries also show what will happen in Germany. British researchers have created an animation showing Britain divided into counties. It shows how B.1.1.7 starts in the south, soaking the country in a pale pink all the way up to the north until it becomes deep violet at lightning speed in the disease's march to victory.</p><p>The UK example also shows how hard the lockdown has to be in order to stop the mutant’s spread. And in Israel, we are currently seeing how the virus can evade even an aggressive vaccination strategy. It appears that it then just starts infecting more children - another unpleasant finding.</p><p>The numbers illustrating the success the B.1.1.7 mutant has had are quickly outdated. The week before last, the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s center for disease control, reported that the share of the British variant in Germany was just under 5.6 percent. By last Thursday, though, that figure had doubled to 11.2 percent. Less than a week later, it had almost doubled again to over 20 percent.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the city of Düsseldorf announced that B.1.1.7 had been detected in every fifth infected person there. An outbreak had occurred in a homeless shelter, among other places. In the northern German town of Flensburg, about one in three infections with SARS-CoV-2 was an infection with the British variant. And in the northern Bavarian regions of Hof, Wunsiedel and Tirschenreuth, the proportion of new mutants in the positive tests is already at 40 to 70 percent.</p><p>In Cologne, too, at the initiative of Florian Klein, director of the Institute of Virology at the city’s university hospital, all positive coronavirus samples are currently being examined for the new variants using a special PCR test. Right now, B.1.1.7 accounts for around 15 percent of all cases and the South African mutant for around 5 percent.</p><p>But the increase didn’t surprise the virologist. "There is no reason to assume that developments in Germany should be fundamentally different from those in other countries,” says Klein.</p><p>The latest figures indicate that the mutant from the UK currently has a reproduction number of 1.3, meaning that 10 infected people spread the disease to 13 others. "Then the number of cases doubles about every one to two weeks,” calculates physicist Viola Priesemann. If it were to stay that way, there would be more than 30,000 new infections a day in Germany again after Easter, despite the extension of the lockdown.</p><p>"According to our predictions, if you were to relax the (lockdown) rules now, then one would expect that B.1.1.7 would be dominant sometime in March,” says modeler Meyer-Hermann. Dominant means that the mutant would account for half of all infections.</p><p>It's still not clear exactly why B.1.1.7, but also the South African and Brazilian variants, manage to infect so many people so easily. However, virologists have identified the mutation that enables the pathogen to do so: It’s called N501Y and it affects the binding of the virus to host cells. According to the initial findings, it helps the pathogen infect a human being in a significantly shorter amount of time. As such, the definition of what can be described as a close contact may have to be changed.</p><p>Initially, it appeared that the new variants were killing disproportionately more than the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus simply because they were infecting so many more people. More recent data, however, has led to the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>This is part of my <a href="http://stewiewrites.com/letters-to-my-20-year-old-self/">Letters To My 20-Year-Old Self</a>.</em></p>

<p>Every day, you see so many things you want. Books. Computer equipment.  Knick knacks. Ingredients for a new recipe. Materials for an outdoor project.  Used furniture bargains.  Random exercise equipment. So many garage sales—so little time!</p>

<p>Your natural impulse is to buy it all. Empty your bank account and embrace your heap of stuff.  And then get a bigger home to hold your horde. And then a storage unit.  Or two. Maybe three? Start with a 5x5 but graduate to 10x10.  And 10x20.  Then a warehouse in the industrial district.</p>

<p>You’ll need a truck to haul your stuff around.  A small pickup, at first. Then a full-size truck and flatbed trailer.  Eventually, you’ll buy a 26 foot used UHaul…</p>

<p>This. Is. Bonkers. Don’t go down this road. Or the stuff you own will own you.  Also, you’ll end up divorced, bankrupt, and miserable.</p>

<p>So what’s the alternative?</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to just not buy anything.  Cut up your credit cards and stash your debit card in a block of ice. But this isn’t reasonable.  You actually need some of what you buy.  And some purchases improve your quality of life.</p>

<p>But how do you suss out things you really need? How can you tell which bargains will boost your overall happiness?</p>

<p>The solution is to create a “Stuff I want” list.  Whenever you want something, add it to the list and wait 48 hours.  95% of the time, your interest in the item will fizzle. Some new must-have thing will capture your attention. And you’ll be better off because you didn’t shell out your hard-earned money for something you didn’t actually want.</p>

<p>Also, when you want something that costs $100 or more, wait seven days.  (I know, this feels like an eternity!)  But add expensive items to your 7-day list, and 90% of the time, your interest will wither away.  You can do this.</p>

<p>You cannot fathom how much money you will save! More money in the bank means more options and freedom to do what you want.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s dive deeper</strong></p>

<p>Growing up, no one ever told you the dirty little secret of a consumerist society: there’s always <em>more</em> to want, no matter what you have.  Craving never ceases.  So keep your cash and save it for things you really want in the long run.</p>

<p>People also never told you how limited your time is.  In your mind, there’s time to try all the recipes in those $5 French and Italian cookbooks you grabbed at a yardsale. There’s time to use all that exercise equipment, rebuild all those computers, and read all those classic novels.  But reality is another matter.  You have 16-waking hours each day and far less free time. You can’t do all the things you imagined doing.  Or even 10% of them.</p>

<p>Accept that your time is scarce—more scarce than money! You’ll let go of the notion that you can do everything.  Accept that opening the door to one hobby means shutting the door to ten others. You’ll let go of the feeling that you could do more or should do more.</p>

<p>This line of thinking, this perspective, will innoculate you against consumerism’s wiles. It creates a protective shield against the army of advertisements that blare, “Pleasure is just one purchase away.” This way of seeing the world transforms advertisements into mere distractions, like a cloud of gnats you swat away when it buzzes too close.</p>

<p>One last thing: don’t watch advertisements. Don’t let their bright colors, upbeat tempos, and attractive actors mesmerize you.  They seem benign, but they all have one purpose: to change your behavior. They’re not entertainment, and they’re not your friend.  Block them with browser AdBlock extensions. And watch TV shows without the ads.</p>

<p>This probably sounds extreme, but I urge you to try it out. You’ll see how ads, with their song of “You’re incomplete because you don’t have this!” is a monstrous weight on your soul.  Try it out, and you’ll discover peace and quiet within yourself.  Lastly, try it out and reclaim your emotional energy to pursue your short-term goals and long-term dreams.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Rust is an incredible language. It is fast, strongly-typed, and its developer experience and community are some of the best. Rust is also one of the few languages that can compile to WebAssembly (WASM), which means we can write Rust code that runs in modern browsers! This opens up the possibility of a front end framework written in Rust.</p>
<h2>Why do we want a Rust front-end framework?</h2>
<p>A Rust front-end framework brings the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness thanks to strong typing</li>
<li>Ability to share code with Rust backend</li>
<li>Performance (if done right)</li>
<li>Ability to run it in a separate thread/worker to prevent blocking the UI thread</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework could be platform agnostic, achieving the holy grail of "write once run anywhere" that Java so heavily touted in the 1990s. Personally, this is the biggest reason, as people spend countless hours rewriting UIs for a different platform.</p>
<p>There are disadvantages to a Rust front-end framework, mostly due to the limitations of WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a simple binary instruction format, so the file size tends to be bigger than JavaScript files, which means they take longer to download. Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">WebAssembly Interface Types specification</a> is not finalized, which means we can only communicate with JavaScript via binary at the moment.</p>
<h2>What makes a Rust front-end framework hard</h2>
<h3>Rust ownership and graphs</h3>
<p>Rust has a unique concept known as ownership, which allows safe concurrent code by ensuring that there is only one owner for a reference at any point in time. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Rust Book's explanation on ownership</a> goes much deeper into the subject.</p>
<p>As a result of this ownership constraint, data ownership structures in Rust are typically trees. Data structures like doubly-linked lists and graphs where there isn't a clear owner are much harder to write. They require the knowledge and usage of interior mutability or unsafe Rust.</p>
<p>Existing front-end frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seed-rs/seed">Seed</a> adopt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">The Elm Architecture (TEA)</a>, which is a top-to-bottom, tree-like way of managing components and state. For those more familiar with JavaScript, TEA was the inspiration for Redux.</p>
<p>This tree-like structure is what Rust prefers, with the trade-off that the state must flow from the top-to-bottom. Each time, subtrees must diff the state to avoid re-rendering, which means that the state diffing logic takes O(log n) time. As the application grows bigger, state management becomes more cumbersome and less efficient. The more recent sentiment in the JavaScript community is that Redux should not be in charge of all states. TEA goes against this as there is no concept of local state.</p>
<p>If we want to achieve the most efficient O(1) way of diffing state, we would require a reactivity system similar to the ones used by Vue and Svelte. Unfortunately for us, reactivity systems are graphs. A reactivity system comprises of state and effects. Effects need references to state to do some computation, and state needs references to effects to inform them to re-compute.</p>
<p>This is the biggest hurdle. In order to introduce an ergonomic reactivity system, it seems we would need a special memory allocator, like a slab allocator with garbage collection to avoid Rust's ownership issues.</p>
<h3>Rust ergonomics</h3>
<p>Although Rust is an amazing language for many things, it does have some warts of its own. One of the most common parts of writing front-end code is passing down props to a child component. In Rust, there isn't a way to ignore optional properties.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Component</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyButton</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Button</span> <span>{</span>
            textContent<span>:</span> <span>"Click Me"</span><span>,</span>
            style<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            class<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onClick<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onHover<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onBlur<span>:</span> <span>None</span>
            
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Due to this limitation, Rust libraries resort to either the builder pattern or macros. The builder pattern allows auto-completion but results in code bloat due to all the extra function definitions. Using macros, on the other hand, is terser but prevents auto-completion from working.</p>
<p>Another limitation is Rust's inability to share common properties between structs, deferring the responsibility to traits instead. While it works well for most programming, component-based architecture requires components to pass down properties to their child components.</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ButtonProps</span> <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    onClick<span>:</span> <span>OnClickHandler</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>ButtonContainer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>..</span><span>ButtonProps</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h3>Rust's code bloat</h3>
<p>While Rust is very well suited for system programming, its foray into embedded systems has only just started. As a result of earlier design choices, Rust has a rather big standard library.</p>
<p>When we try to compile Rust to WebAssembly file formats (.wasm), just the "hello world" example's size is in the tens of kilobytes. The most popular Rust front-end framework, Yew, results in wasm files that start from 300kB onwards. This may look acceptably small, but compared to JavaScript front-end libraries like <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> (17kB) and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> (4kB), it is gigantic.</p>
<p>On the optimistic side, Rust is still a young language, and many of these code bloat issues are currently being tackled by the embedded working group:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/41">Panic handler binary size bloat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/18"><code>core::fmt</code> machinery optimized for size</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the issues that are preventing an easy-to-use Rust front-end framework from being written. However, the Rust and WebAssembly scenes are burgeoning, and given enough time, improvements will come. But don't wait, now is the perfect time to start learning Rust and WebAssembly before it becomes the next big thing!</p>

<p>Published: <span data-test-id="date-time"><time datetime="2021-02-19T04:25:21Z">February 19, 2021 at 05.25</time></span><br><strong>Updated: </strong><strong><span data-test-id="date-time"><time datetime="2021-02-19T09:47:01Z">February 19, 2021 at 10.47</time></span></strong></p>
<p data-test-tag="@spp/ui-lead-text">Most countries in Europe have been hit much harder by the pandemic than Sweden, according to a recent compilation of excess mortality. But in the Nordic countries, Sweden is by far the highest. The pattern is reminiscent of previous pandemics.</p>
<p>– There are myths circulating that Sweden would be among the worst affected by covid-19 in Europe. That was true to some extent at the end of the first wave in May, and it seems to be the image that has stuck to the retina of many. But now you see that Sweden is one of the more mildly affected countries in Europe, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, historian at Stockholm University and author of the book “Corona – the pandemic of our time in a historical perspective”.</p>
<p>– About two thirds of the countries in Europe have a significantly higher excess mortality rate than Sweden. But in the Nordic region, Sweden is still by far the highest. So far, I must say, because the situation in Denmark is now deteriorating at the beginning of the year, he adds.</p>
<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Robust dimensions</h2>
<p>Excess mortality is calculated by comparing how many people have died during the year compared with the previous four years, and is one of the more accurate ways of examining how a society is affected by, for example, a pandemic. According to Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, it is a basic tool, as he analyzes the consequences of famine, plagues and other historical events.</p>
<p>– It is a robust measure, which makes it possible to compare different countries with similar demographics. Starting from the countries’ own reporting of infection and deaths in covid-19 is in principle meaningless, because testing and criteria vary so much. In addition, doing it week by week at the beginning of a pandemic is almost bland, as the situation changes drastically the longer the infection lasts. We already know this from pandemics, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>
<p>By compiling the latest available data on excess mortality in Europe in 2020, he has seen patterns that are largely reminiscent of how previous pandemics have affected Europe.</p>
<p>– A typical phenomenon is that the countries that are slightly affected during the first wave get a much harder blow during the next wave. Areas such as Central and Eastern Europe coped well with the first wave, but were hit hard during the second wave of autumn and winter. Now after the New Year, the pandemic has also hit Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia and Latvia hard, which were previously quite spared, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Nordic pattern</h2>
<p>Another interesting pattern can be seen in the Nordic countries, he points out. During the recent major outbreaks of disease – the Asian (1957), the Hong Kong flu (1968) and the severe flu in 1976 – Sweden, together with Denmark, has mostly been hit harder than Norway, Iceland and Finland. Nobody has been able to fully explain what this is due to. According to Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, possible causes could be Sweden’s and Denmark’s much larger and cohesive urban areas and closer contact with the continent.</p>
<p>– Most say that Norway, Finland and Iceland will have the lowest death rates in the Nordic countries and in fact in all of Europe when the pandemic is over, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>
<p>TT: Could it not be that fewer people die from, for example, influenza and winter vomiting due to all the pandemic restrictions, so that the mortality rate in covid-19 is actually higher than the calculated excess mortality rate?</p>
<p>– Yes, it can be. But it is the same pattern in all European countries, so it does not matter for the comparison, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Historical unusualness</h2>
<p>Severe pandemics have been a relatively common condition throughout history, affecting humanity at approximately 30-year intervals in recent centuries. Against this background, Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist thinks that it is actually a historical unusual that this pandemic lasted so long.</p>
<p>– There is a reason why many are so unprepared today. Our view of illness and death has also changed dramatically. We see it as something that can usually be avoided, so we are not used to so many people getting seriously ill or dying in a short time.</p>
<p>A seemingly paradoxical effect of all medical advances, he adds, is that even less serious viruses can have more severe consequences today, as the proportion of the elderly and vulnerable has increased sharply.</p>
<p>– It is basically something very positive. But it can also be more difficult for society to deal with such a disease, and the habit of pandemics can cause great anxiety and panic. Then it is easy to lose the holistic perspective, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

There's dozens of different overlay network implementations that combine a stateful IPv4 address allocator with VXLAN as a transport layer. IPv4 overlay networks have a number of well-documented drawbacks, which contributes to Kubernetes' reputation as difficult to operate beyond small cluster sizes (~10,000 machines).</p><p>This page describes an overlay network based on stateless IPv6 tunnels, which have better reliability and scalability characteristics than stateful IPv4 overlays.

It was originally designed as part of the IPv6 migration strategy, allowing isolated IPv6-only networks to use existing internet infrastructure. The protocol is extremely simple – the IPv6 packet is treated as an IPv4 payload, using protocol number 41.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling">Teredo</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380">RFC 4380</a>) extends 6to4 by adding a layer of UDP encapsulation, which can improve compatibility with intermediate network devices that have compatibility issues with non-TCP/UDP protocols. This page assumes use of Teredo, but if the underlying network allows 6to4 (protocol 41) then the UDP encap can be turned off to save 8 bytes per packet.</p><p>The Linux kernel has built-in support for creating 6to4 tunnels in the <tt>sit</tt> driver. Such tunnels can optionally use the Teredo protocol by enabling the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/614348/">Foo Over UDP</a> (FOU) mode, which is a setting for Linux tunnel drivers that encapsulates packets in UDP. FOU computes synthetic source ports for outbound packets based on the encapsulated packet's connection tuple, thus allowing intermediate routers to distinguish underlying streams (e.g. for link aggregation or flow control).</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Pod address allocation</h2><p>The 6to4 wire protocol describes how to encapsulate IPv6 packets, but doesn't mandate how IPv6 addresses should be assigned or how a router should calculate the IPv4 address of the destination<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.

				<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>My VLSI tools take a chip from conception through testing. Perhaps 500 lines of source code. Cadence, Mentor Graphics do the same, more or less. With how much source/object code?</span></span></span></span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://www.colorforth.com/1percent.html">Chuck Moore</a>, the inventor of Forth</em></p>
<p>This is a personal account of my experience implementing and using the Forth programming language and the stack machine architecture. "Implementing and using" – in that order, pretty much; a somewhat typical order, as will become apparent.</p>
<p>It will also become clear why, having defined the instruction set of a processor designed to run Forth that went into production, I don't consider myself a competent Forth programmer (now is the time to warn that my understanding of Forth is just that – my own understanding; wouldn't count on it too much.)</p>
<p>Why the epigraph about Chuck Moore's VLSI tools? Because Forth is very radical. Black Square kind of radical. An approach to programming seemingly leaving out most if not all of programming:</p>
<blockquote><p>…Forth does it differently. There is no syntax, no redundancy, no typing. There are no errors that can be detected. …there are no parentheses. No indentation. No hooks, no compatibility. …No files. No operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/black-square.jpg" alt="Black Square by Kazimir Malevich" width="220" height="218"></p>
<p>I've never been a huge fan of suprematism or modernism in general. However, a particular modernist can easily get my attention if he's a genius in a traditional sense, with superpowers. Say, he memorizes note sheets upon the first brief glance like Shostakovich did.</p>
<p>Now, I've seen chip design tools by the likes of Cadence and Mentor Graphics. Astronomically costly licenses. Geological run times. And nobody quite knows what they do. To me, VLSI tools in 500 lines qualify as a superpower, enough to grab my attention.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was intrigued with Forth ever since I read about it in Bruce Eckel's book on C++, a 198-something edition; he said there that "extensibility got a bad reputation due to languages like Forth, where a programmer could change everything and effectively create a programming language of his own". WANT!</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I looked for info on the net, which seemed somewhat scarce. An unusually looking language. Parameters and results passed implicitly on a stack. 2 3 + instead of 2+3. Case-insensitive. Nothing about the extensibility business though.</p>
<p>I thought of nothing better than to dive into the source of an implementation, <a title="Portable Forth in 'C'. Why do Forth programmers put C in quotes?" href="http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/">pForth</a> – and I didn't need anything better, as my mind was immediately blown away by the following passage right at the top of <a href="http://pforth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fth/system.fth">system.fth</a>, the part of pForth implemented in Forth on top of the C interpreter:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>: (   41 word drop ; immediate
( That was the definition for the comment word. )
( Now we can add comments to what we are doing! )</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now. we. can. add. comments. to. what. we. are. doing.</p>
<p>What this does is define a word (Forth's name for a function) called "(". "(" is executed at compile time (as directed by IMMEDIATE). It tells the compiler to read bytes from the source file (that's what the word called, um, WORD is doing), until a ")" – ASCII 41 – is found. Those bytes are then ignored (the pointer to them is removed from the stack with DROP). So effectively, everything inside "( … )" becomes a comment.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em> Yeah, you definitely can't do that in C++. (You <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/CLHS/Body/f_set_ma.htm#set-macro-character">can</a> in Lisp but they don't teach you those parts at school. They teach the pure functional parts, where you <em>can't</em> do things that you <em>can</em> in C++. Bastards.)</p>
<p>Read some more and…</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><em> conditional primitives</em>
: IF     <em>( -- f orig )</em>  ?comp compile 0branch  conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate
: THEN   <em>( f orig -- )</em>  swap ?condition  &gt;resolve   ; immediate
: BEGIN  <em>( -- f dest )</em>  ?comp conditional_key &lt;mark   ; immediate
: AGAIN  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile branch  swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: UNTIL  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile 0branch swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: AHEAD  <em>( -- f orig )</em>  compile branch   conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Conditional <em>primitives</em>?! Looks like conditional primitives aren't – they <em>define</em> them here. This COMPILE BRANCH business modifies the code of a function that uses IF or THEN, at compile time. THEN – one part of the conditional – writes (RESOLVEs) a branch offset to a point in code saved (MARKed) by IF, the other part of the conditional.</p>
<p>It's as if a conventional program modified the assembly instructions generated from it at compile time. What? How? Who? How do I wrap my mind around this?</p>
<p>Shocked, I read the source of pForth.</p>
<p>Sort of understood how Forth code was represented and interpreted. Code is this array of "execution tokens" – function pointers, numbers and a few built-ins like branches, basically. A Forth interpreter keeps an instruction pointer into this array (ip), a data stack (ds), and a return stack (rs), and does this:</p>
<pre><strong>while</strong>(<strong>true</strong>) {
 <strong>switch</strong>(*ip) {
  <em>//arithmetics (+,-,*...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>PLUS: ds.push(ds.pop() + ds.pop()); ++ip;
  <em>//stack manipulation (drop,swap,rot...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>DROP: ds.pop(); ++ip;
  <em>//literal numbers (1,2,3...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>LITERAL: ds.push(ip[1]); ip+=2;
  <em>//control flow:</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>COND_BRANCH: <strong>if</strong>(!ds.pop()) ip+=ip[1]; <strong>else </strong>ip+=2;
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>RETURN: ip = rs.pop();
  <em>//user-defined words: save return address &amp; jump</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>default</strong>: rs.push(ip+1); ip = *ip;
 }
}</pre>
<p>That's it, pretty much. Similar, say, to the virtual stack machine used to implement Java. One difference is that compiling a Forth program is basically writing to the code array in a WYSIWYG fashion. COMPILE SOMETHING simply appends the address of the word SOMETHING to the end of the code array. So does plain SOMETHING when Forth is compiling rather than interpreting, as it is between a colon and a semicolon, that is, when a word is defined.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE 2DUP UP RIGHT DOWN LEFT ;</pre>
<p>simply appends {&amp;2dup,&amp;up,&amp;right,&amp;down,&amp;left,RETURN} to the code array. Very straightforward. There are no parameters or declaration/expression syntax as in…</p>
<pre><strong>void </strong>drawRectangle(<strong>int </strong>width, <strong>int </strong>height) {
  up(height);
  right(width);
  down(height);
  left(width);
}</pre>
<p>…to make it less than absolutely clear how the source code maps to executable code. "C maps straightforwardly to assembly"? Ha! <em>Forth</em> maps straightforwardly to assembly. Well, to the assembly language of a virtual stack machine, but still. So one can understand how self-modifying code like IF and THEN works.</p>
<p>On the other hand, compared to drawRectangle, it is somewhat unclear what DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>does</em>. What are those 2 values on the top of the stack that 2DUP duplicates before meaningful English names appear in DRAW-RECTANGLE's definition? This is supposed to be ameliorated by stack comments:</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>( width height -- )</em> ... ;</pre>
<p>…tells us that DRAW-RECTANGLE expects to find height at the top of the stack, and width right below it.</p>
<p>I went on to sort of understand CREATE/DOES&gt; – a further extension of this compile-time self-modifying code business that you use to "define defining words" (say, CONSTANT, VARIABLE, or CLASS). The CREATE part says what should be done when words (say, class names) are defined by your new defining word. The DOES&gt; part says what should be done when those words are used. For example:</p>
<pre>: CONSTANT
  &nbsp;CREATE ,
  &nbsp;DOES&gt; @
;
<em>\ usage example:</em>
7 CONSTANT DAYS-IN-WEEK
DAYS-IN-WEEK 2 + . <em>\ should print 9</em></pre>
<p>CREATE means that every time CONSTANT is called, a name is read from the source file (similarly to what WORD would have done). Then a new word is created with that name (as a colon would have done). This word records the value of HERE – something like sbrk(0), a pointer past the last allocated data item. When the word is executed, it pushes the saved address onto the data stack, then calls the code after DOES&gt;. The code after CREATE can put some data after HERE, making it available later to the DOES&gt; part.</p>
<p>With CONSTANT, the CREATE part just saves its input (in our example, 7) – the comma word does this: *HERE++ = ds.pop(); The DOES&gt; part then fetches the saved number – the @ sign is the fetch word: ds.push( *ds.pop() );</p>
<p>CONSTANT works somewhat similarly to a class, CREATE defining its constructor and DOES&gt; its single method:</p>
<pre>class Constant
  def initialize(x) @x=x end
  def does() @x end
end
daysInWeek = Constant.new(7)
print daysInWeek.does() + 2</pre>
<p>…But it's much more compact on all levels.</p>
<p>Another example is defining C-like structs. Stripped down to their bare essentials (and in Forth things tend to be stripped down to their bare essentials), you can say that:</p>
<pre><strong>struct </strong>Rectangle {
  <strong>int </strong>width;
  <strong>int </strong>height;
};</pre>
<p>…simply gives 8 (the structure size) a new name Rectangle, and gives 0 and 4 (the members' offsets) new names, width and height. Here's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Forth_Lesson_18">one way to implement structs in Forth</a>:</p>
<pre>struct
  cell field width
  cell field height
constant rectangle

<em>\ usage example:</em>
<em>\ here CREATE is used just for allocation</em>
create r1 rectangle allot <em>\ r1=HERE; HERE+=8</em>
2 r1 width !
3 r1 height !
: area dup width @ swap height @ * ;
r1 area . <em>\ should print 6</em></pre>
<p>CELL is the size of a word; we could say "4 field width" instead of "cell field width" on 32b machines. Here's the definition of FIELD:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;: field <em>( struct-size field-size -- new-struct-size )</em>
    create over , +
    does&gt; @ +
&nbsp;;</pre>
<p>Again, pretty compact. The CREATE part stores the offset, a.k.a current struct size (OVER does ds.push(ds[1]), comma does *HERE++=ds.pop()), then adds the field size to the struct size, updating it for the next call to FIELD. The DOES&gt; part fetches the offset, and adds it to the top of the stack, supposedly containing the object base pointer, so that "rect width" or "rect height" compute &amp;rect.width or &amp;rect.height, respectively. Then you can access this address with @ or ! (fetch/store). STRUCT simply pushes 0 to the top of the data stack (initial size value), and at the end, CONSTANT consumes the struct size:</p>
<pre>struct <em>\ data stack: 0</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 0 4 )</em> field width  <em>( ds: 4 )</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 4 4 )</em> field height <em>( ds: 8 )</em>
constant rectangle <em>( ds: as before STRUCT )</em></pre>
<p>You can further extend this to support polymorphic methods – METHOD would work similarly to FIELD, fetching a function pointer ("execution token") through a …</p></div></div>

February 20, 2021 | https://healeycodes.com/webassembly-search-tools-for-static-websites/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://healeycodes.com/webassembly-search-tools-for-static-websites/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The challenge of searching static websites is effectively a solved problem with brilliant, yet widely unadopted, solutions.</p>
<p>These projects scan and index your content at build time and ship it to the browser with the rest of your static files. No out-of-your-control external service required. A small library in JavaScript (sometimes accompanied by WebAssembly) loads the index and allows instant searching and works just fine offline. Searching the complete Federalist Papers for multiple keywords takes less than 100µs in my Wasm <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search">tech demo</a> (I’ll get to that later on).</p>
<p>The most popular libraries are written in JavaScript like <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/krisk/Fuse">Fuse</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch">FlexSearch</a>. They provide pre-compiled indexes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching">fuzzy</a>, wildcard, and boolean searches. They have good documentation and are ready for production usage.</p>
<p>But I’m more interested in how the up-and-coming Wasm-powered projects work. Browser search is a space where Wasm can really find an edge. Wasm runs faster, loads quicker, and ships smaller binaries (in theory, in practice it takes some work to get there).</p>
<p>The two projects I looked at both use Rust as a backend language:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch">tinysearch</a> generates a small, self-contained Wasm module (with an embedded index). It aims for a small memory footprint by using Bloom filters — a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that results in a negligible amount of false positives. Read more in <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch">A Tiny, Static, Full-Text Search Engine using Rust and WebAssembly</a> by the creator, Matthias Endler.</li>
<li><a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork</a> focuses more on the developer experience with rich documentation and examples. Stork also pays keen attention to the user experience by providing a progress bar for loading the index, excerpts for the results (keywords highlighted), theme support, and more (see <a href="https://stork-search.net/docs/interface">Embedding the Interface</a>). Learn about how it came to life in <a href="https://jameslittle.me/blog/2020/one-year-of-stork/">Stork Turns One: Building a search tool for static sites with Rust and WebAssembly</a> by the creator, James Little.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stork is more interesting to me because it focuses on the human experience — of the person who builds with it, and the person who searches. See the thin, quick, configurable UI below.</p>
<p><img src="https://healeycodes.com/bc9b4462651559eaacdb0d1bd4d4f766/stork.gif" alt="The Stork instant search in-action"></p>
<p>In order to understand how these search tools work, and the design problems involved, I built a technical demo in Go, compiled to Wasm.</p>
<h2 id="technical-demo"><a href="#technical-demo" aria-label="technical demo permalink"></a>Technical Demo</h2>
<p>My technical demo is inspired by Stork and uses a near-identical configuration file setup. So it had to be named after a bird 🐦 too — <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search">healeycodes/crane-search</a>.</p>
<p>Crane is two programs. The first program scans a group of documents and builds an efficient index. 1MB of text and metadata is turned into a 25KB index (14KB gzipped). The second program is a Wasm module that is sent to the browser along with a little bit of JavaScript glue code and the index. The result is an instant search engine that helps users find web pages as they type.</p>
<p>The full-text search engine is powered in part with code from Artem Krylysov’s blog post <a href="https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2020/07/28/lets-build-a-full-text-search-engine/">Let’s build a Full-Text Search engine</a>.</p>
<p>The core data-structure is an inverted index. It maps words to document IDs. This means we can check very quickly (i.e. 100µs within Wasm) which documents a word can be found in. At build time, we loop over the document files and add to the inverted index. We also create a list of results so we can relate a document ID to a document’s metadata (defined in the configuration file). The metadata includes the title and URL so that we can display a list of search results in the browser.</p>
<p>We can return results for multiple keywords by looking at the common document IDs for each keyword. This takes linear time as the IDs are inserted into the index in order.</p>
<p>During the build stage, we perform normalization to make the search engine more helpful and accurate. For example, if you search for <code>fish</code> you probably want to match <code>Fishing</code>. Words are turned into lowercase, common words are dropped, and words are reduced into their root form (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> — Krylysov’s example code uses <a href="https://github.com/kljensen/snowball">Snowball</a> as a stemmer).</p>
<p>The document <code>"Alice likes to go fishing"</code> becomes <code>["alice", "go", "fish"]</code>. The search term <code>"Fishing"</code> is also turned into a token, at search-time it becomes <code>"fish"</code>.</p>
<p>To handle the document metadata, Crane’s build program is passed the location of the configuration file. This tells it where to find the documents to index on disk, where they can be found on the static website, and what the search result should be titled.</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>input</span><span>]</span>
<span>files</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>path</span> <span>=</span> <span>"docs/essays/essay01.txt"</span><span>,</span>

<span>]</span>

<span>[</span><span>output</span><span>]</span>
<span>filename</span> <span>=</span> <span>"dist/federalist.crane"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The index and result data is combined into a single struct called a store. It’s encoded using <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/">encoding/gob</a>, a binary encoding that is faster and smaller than JSON (<a href="https://gist.github.com/evalphobia/a2ba2636acbc112f68dcd89e8b81d349">one</a>, <a href="http://ugorji.net/blog/benchmarking-serialization-in-go">two</a>).</p>
<div data-language="go"><pre><code>file<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> os<span>.</span><span>Create</span><span>(</span>config<span>.</span>Output<span>.</span>Filename<span>)</span>

<span>check</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second part of Crane is the program that’s compiled into Wasm and sent to the browser. It uses the Go standard library package <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Package js gives access to the WebAssembly host environment when using the js/wasm architecture. Its API is based on JavaScript semantics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our browser program makes two functions available in the global JavaScript scope. A new goroutine is spawned when they’re called.</p>

<p>Here’s a high-level view of how everything fits together.</p>

<p>A JavaScript support file, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/7be8358f70ff858f28b9aefe11986da25f1762bc/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js">wasm_exec.js</a>, provides a Go class that connects JavaScript ⟷ Go. The Wasm module is loaded with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiateStreaming">WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming</a> (<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b2fcfc1a50fbd46556f7075f7f1fbf600b5c9e5d/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.html#L17-L22">polyfill available</a>) and is passed to the Go instance. The store is downloaded via the Fetch API and is passed to the running Wasm module where the gob-encoded binary is decoded.</p>
<p>I wrote a ~50 line <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search/blob/main/dist/crane.js">class</a> that abstracts away most of this to make the project easier for a developer to interact with.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> crane <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Crane</span><span>(</span><span>"crane.wasm"</span><span>,</span> <span>"federalist.crane"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>results<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result is, well, it’s no Stork. But it works and it’s fast. If there’s one way to get a developer to respect the complexity of your project, have them build a technical demo of it with 1/50th of the features.</p>
<p><img src="https://healeycodes.com/13369abd9f26ba2ad6d7025a52373e11/crane.gif" alt="Searching for keywords with Crane from the same dataset as Stork"></p>
<p>The binary is too large at around 3MB (but I didn’t optimize for this). The solution for this is to read <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#reducing-the-size-of-wasm-files">Reducing the size of Wasm files</a> from the Go GitHub or read any of the blogs that come up when you search <code>shrink go wasm binary</code>. The best advice I found is to use <a href="https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo">TinyGo</a> to generate the Wasm (the “Hello world” example is 575 bytes) and to limit the number of libraries you include. TinyGo actually artificially limits the libraries that you can use because it implements a subset of Go — which means the encoding/gob package is out (encoding/json too).</p>
<h2 id="design-problems"><a href="#design-problems" aria-label="design problems permalink"></a>Design Problems</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing I learned, it’s that search is a reasonably solved problem. It’s easy to get started; stand on the shoulders of algorithms and away you go. The key problem in this space is the developer experience. Configuring the build process of a static site can be tricky when things beyond the standard content (e.g. posts, images) need to be generated. In order to return metadata about each result, these types of search tools require a config (usually TOML or JSON) and generating these files adds complexity.</p>
<p>Setting up a search bar with any features beyond the basics (e.g. auto-complete, full keyboard support, highlighted excerpts) is non-trivial too, especially when you want it to feel good and always react fast.</p>
<p>It’s also hard to build a solution that solves all use cases. Every time a feature is added (e.g. zero tolerance for false positives, fuzzy search, excerpts, partial matching) the index size grows by an order of magnitude. One rather esoteric idea that I toyed around with was building a search solution that split the index depending on the letters the user entered. Having an index for all the words that start with <code>a</code> and one for <code>b</code> and so on. However, English letter frequency is weighted towards things like <code>th</code> (see <a href="https://norvig.com/mayzner.html">English Letter Frequency Counts:
Mayzner Revisited</a>).</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of getting people to contribute to your project. Wasm is a reasonably young technology and building, testing, and debugging your code feels harder than it should be. Building a full-stack Wasm project always feels like it requires one-too-many steps. (For Go, it’s worth calling out <a href="https://github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest">wasmbrowsertest</a> that automates in-browser testing.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">Introduction to WebAssembly</a>, the best low-level introduction to the technology I’ve seen, Rasmus Andersson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web is an amazing concept that is currently falling short carrying a heavy legacy from the past. In order to bring truly great experiences to the web and blur the lines of what is and what isn’t a “native” experience, WebAssembly—or something else like it—needs to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A search tool for static sites is a good fit for Wasm, and I hope to see projects in this space continue to evolve. It’s a noble goal to build a project which actually has <strong>four</strong> design areas when you think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-end (build process)</li>
<li>Back-of-the-front-end (search algorithm/Wasm)</li>
<li>Front-of-the-front-end (results UI)</li>
<li>Developer integration …</li></ul></section></div>

<p>This article is about building actors with Tokio directly, without using any
actor libraries such as Actix. This turns out to be rather easy to do, however
there are some details you should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where to put the <code>tokio::spawn</code> call.</li>
<li>Struct with <code>run</code> method vs bare function.</li>
<li>Handles to the actor.</li>
<li>Backpressure and bounded channels.</li>
<li>Graceful shutdown.</li>
</ol>
<p>The techniques outlined in this article should work with any executor, but for
simplicity we will only talk about Tokio.  There is some overlap with the
<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning">spawning</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels">channel chapters</a> from the Tokio tutorial, and I recommend also
reading those chapters.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Before we can talk about how to write an actor, we need to know what an actor
is. The basic idea behind an actor is to spawn a self-contained task that
performs some job independently of other parts of the program. Typically these
actors communicate with the rest of the program through the use of message
passing channels. Since each actor runs independently, programs designed using
them are naturally parallel.</p>
<p>A common use-case of actors is to assign the actor exclusive ownership of some
resource you want to share, and then let other tasks access this resource
indirectly by talking to the actor. For example, if you are implementing a chat
server, you may spawn a task for each connection, and a master task that routes
chat messages between the other tasks. This is useful because the master task
can avoid having to deal with network IO, and the connection tasks can focus
exclusively on dealing with network IO.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2>
<p>An actor is split into two parts: the task and the handle. The task is the
independently spawned Tokio task that actually performs the duties of the actor,
and the handle is a struct that allows you to communicate with the task.</p>
<p>Let's consider a simple actor. The actor internally stores a counter that is
used to obtain some sort of unique id. The basic structure of the actor would be
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use </span><span>tokio::sync::{oneshot, mpsc};

</span><span>struct </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>receiver</span><span>: mpsc::Receiver&lt;ActorMessage&gt;,
    </span><span>next_id</span><span>: </span><span>u32</span><span>,
}
</span><span>enum </span><span>ActorMessage {
    GetUniqueId {
        respond_to: oneshot::Sender&lt;</span><span>u32</span><span>&gt;,
    },
}

</span><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>receiver</span><span>: mpsc::Receiver&lt;ActorMessage&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Self </span><span>{
        MyActor {
            receiver,
            next_id: </span><span>0</span><span>,
        }
    }
    </span><span>fn </span><span>handle_message</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>msg</span><span>: ActorMessage) {
        </span><span>match</span><span> msg {
            ActorMessage::GetUniqueId { respond_to } =&gt; {
                </span><span>self</span><span>.next_id += </span><span>1</span><span>;

                </span><span>// The `let _ =` ignores any errors when sending.
                //
                // This can happen if the `select!` macro is used
                // to cancel waiting for the response.
                </span><span>let </span><span>_ = respond_to.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.next_id);
            },
        }
    }
}

async </span><span>fn </span><span>run_my_actor</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>actor</span><span>: MyActor) {
    </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = actor.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
        actor.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the actor itself, we also need a handle to the actor. A handle
is an object that other pieces of code can use to talk to the actor, and is also
what keeps the actor alive.</p>
<p>The handle will look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=1e60fb476843fb130db9034e8ead210c">full example</a></p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the different pieces in this example.</p>
<p><strong><code>ActorMessage.</code></strong> The <code>ActorMessage</code> enum defines the kind of messages we can
send to the actor. By using an enum, we can have many different message types,
and each message type can have its own set of arguments. We return a value to
the sender by using an <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/sync/oneshot/index.html"><code>oneshot</code></a> channel, which is a message passing channel
that allows sending exactly one message.</p>
<p>In the example above, we match on the enum inside a <code>handle_message</code> method on
the actor struct, but that isn't the only way to structure this. One could also
match on the enum in the <code>run_my_actor</code> function. Each branch in this match
could then call various methods such as <code>get_unique_id</code> on the actor object.</p>
<p><strong>Errors when sending messages.</strong> When dealing with channels, not all errors are
fatal.  Because of this, the example sometimes uses <code>let _ =</code> to ignore errors.
Generally a <code>send</code> operation on a channel fails if the receiver has been
dropped.</p>
<p>The first instance of this in our example is the line in the actor where we
respond to the message we were sent. This can happen if the receiver is no
longer interested in the result of the operation, e.g. the task might that sent
the message might have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>Shutdown of actor.</strong> We can detect when the actor should shut down by looking
at failures to receive messages. In our example, this happens in the following
while loop:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = actor.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
    actor.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>When all senders to the <code>receiver</code> have been dropped, we know that we will never
receive another message and can therefore shut down the actor. When this
happens, the call to <code>.recv()</code> returns <code>None</code>, and since it does not match the
pattern <code>Some(msg)</code>, the while loop exits and the function returns.</p>
<p><strong><code>#[derive(Clone)]</code></strong> The <code>MyActorHandle</code> struct derives the <code>Clone</code> trait. It
can do this because <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/sync/mpsc/index.html"><code>mpsc</code></a> means that it is a multiple-producer,
single-consumer channel. Since the channel allows multiple producers, we can
freely clone our handle to the actor, allowing us to talk to it from multiple
places.</p>
<h2 id="a-run-method-on-a-struct">A run method on a struct</h2>
<p>The example I gave above uses a top-level function that isn't defined on any
struct as the thing we spawn as a Tokio task, however many people find it more
natural to define a <code>run</code> method directly on the <code>MyActor</code> struct and spawn
that. This certainly works too, but the reason I give an example that uses a
top-level function is that it more naturally leads you towards the approach that
doesn't give you lots of lifetime issues.</p>
<p>To understand why, I have prepared an example of what people unfamiliar with the
pattern often come up with.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        tokio::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
            </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = </span><span>self</span><span>.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
                </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
            }
        });
    }

    </span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>get_unique_id</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>u32 </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(send, recv) = oneshot::channel();
        </span><span>let</span><span> msg = ActorMessage::GetUniqueId {
            respond_to: send,
        };

        </span><span>// Ignore send errors. If this send fails, so does the
        // recv.await below. There's no reason to check for the
        // same failure twice.
        </span><span>let </span><span>_ = </span><span>self</span><span>.sender.</span><span>send</span><span>(msg).await;
        recv.await.</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Actor task has been killed</span><span>")
    }
}

... and no separate MyActorHandle
</span></code></pre>
<p>The two sources of trouble in this example are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>tokio::spawn</code> call is inside <code>run</code>.</li>
<li>The actor and the handle are the same struct.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first issue causes problems because the <code>tokio::spawn</code> function requires the
argument to be <code>'static</code>. This means that the new task must own everything
inside it, which is a problem because the method borrows <code>self</code>, meaning that it
is not able to give away ownership of <code>self</code> to the new task.</p>
<p>The second issue causes problems because Rust enforces the single-ownership
principle. If you combine both the actor and the handle into a single struct,
you are (at least from the compiler's perspective) giving every handle access to
the fields owned by the actor's task. E.g. the <code>next_id</code> integer should be owned
only by the actor's task, and should not be directly accessible from any of the
handles.</p>
<p>That said, there is a version that works. By fixing the two above problems, you
end up with the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    async </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = </span><span>self</span><span>.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
        }
    }
}

</span><span>impl </span><span>MyActorHandle {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>new</span><span>() -&gt; </span><span>Self </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(</span><span>8</span><span>);
        </span><span>let</span><span> actor = MyActor::new(receiver);
        tokio::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{ actor.</span><span>run</span><span>().await });

        </span><span>Self </span><span>{ sender }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works identically to the top-level function. Note that, strictly speaking,
it is possible to write a version where the <code>tokio::spawn</code> is inside <code>run</code>, but
I don't recommend that approach.</p>
<h2 id="variations-on-the-theme">Variations on the theme</h2>
<p>The actor I used as an example in this article uses the request-response
paradigm for the messages, but you don't have to do it this way. In this section
I will give some inspiration to how you can change the idea.</p>
<h3 id="no-responses-to-messages">No responses to messages</h3>
<p>The example I used to introduce the concept includes a response to the messages
sent over a <code>oneshot</code> channel, but you don't always need a response at all. In
these cases there's nothing wrong with just not including the <code>oneshot</code> channel
in the message enum. When there's space in the channel, this will even allow you
to return from sending before the message has been processed.</p>
<p>You should still make sure to use a bounded channel so that the number of
messages waiting in the channel don't grow without bound. In some cases this
will mean that sending still needs to be an async function to handle the cases
where the <code>send</code> operation needs to wait for more space in the channel.</p>
<p>However there is an alternative to making <code>send</code> an async method. You can use
the <code>try_send</code> method, and handle sending failures by simply killing the actor.
This can be useful in cases where the actor is managing a <code>TcpStream</code>,</p></article></main></div></div>

	<p><small>January 27, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've been using Unix for long enough that 'find | xargs' is a reflex.
When I started and for a long time afterward, <code>xargs</code> was your only
choice for efficiently executing a command over a bunch of <code>find</code>
results. If you didn't want to run one <code>grep</code> or <code>rm</code> or whatever
per file (which was generally reasonably slow in those days), you
reached for '<code>find ... -print | xargs ...</code>'. There were <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/XargsTwoGotchas">some
gotchas in traditional <code>xargs</code> usage</a>, and one of
them was why GNU <code>xargs</code>, GNU <code>find</code>, and various other things start
growing options to use the null byte as an argument terminator
instead of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/XargsTwoGotchas">the usual (and surprising) definition</a>.
Over time I adopted to these and soon was mostly using '<code>find ...
-print0 | xargs -0 ...</code>'.</p>

<p>For usage with <code>find</code>, all of this is unnecessary on a modern Unix
and has been for some time, because <code>find</code> folded this into itself.
Modern versions of <code>find</code> don't have just the traditional '<code>-exec</code>',
which runs one command per file, but also an augmented version of
it which aggregates the arguments together like <code>xargs</code> does. This
augmented version is used by ending the '-exec' with '+' instead
of ';', like so:</p>


<blockquote><pre>find . ... -exec grep -H whatever '{}' +
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(I'm giving <code>grep</code> the -H argument for reasons covered <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/GrepDevNull">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Although I sometimes still reflexively use 'find | xargs', more
and more I'm trying to use the simple form of just <code>find</code> with
this augmented -exec. My reflexes can learn new tricks, eventually.</p>

<p>This augmented form of -exec is in the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html">Single Unix Specification
for <code>find</code></a>, so
unsurprisingly it's not just in GNU Find but also <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/find.1">OpenBSD</a>, <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?find(1)">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/find.1">NetBSD</a>, and <a href="https://illumos.org/man/1/find">Illumos</a>. I haven't tried to look up a
<code>find</code> manpage in whatever commercial Unixes are left (probably at
least macOS and AIX).
Based on the rationale section of <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html">the SUS <code>find</code></a>,
this very convenient <code>find</code> feature was introduced in System V R4.
The Single Unix Specification also explains why they didn't adopt
the arguably more Unixy option of '-print0' for null-terminated
output.</p>

<p>(In practice everyone has adopted -print0 as well, even OpenBSD and
Illumos. I assume without checking that they also all have '<code>xargs -0</code>',
because it doesn't make much sense to adopt one without the other.)</p>

<p>PS: Unfortunately this feature is not quite as flexible as it looks.
Both the specification and actual <code>find</code> implementations require
the '{}' to be at the end of the command, instead of anywhere in
it. This means you can't do something like 'find ... -exec mv {}
/some/dir +'. This makes life slightly simpler for <code>find</code>'s code
and probably only rarely matters for actual usage.</p>

<p>Some of the most popular posts I’ve written over the past couple of years were the two that focused on just how rare outsized returns for an individual deal are in venture capital. You can see the original posts <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2019/09/the-markets-are-great-but-venture-outcomes-havent-changed-much.html">here</a>. In those posts I was analyzing data from Correlation Ventures that showed just how skewed venture returns are, specifically that <strong>65% of investment rounds fail to return 1x capital and only 4% return greater than 10x capital</strong>.</p>

<p>Ian Hathaway, who recently co-authored the second edition of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1119617650/ref=asc_df_1119617650/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459726176530&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9536524533228269419&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001941&amp;hvtargid=pla-930155281111&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a> with my partner, Brad, sent me the chart below, which highlights how that translates to returns in venture capital as an asset class. I’ve seen versions of this chart before, and while it’s not surprising it is always jarring to see it laid out like this. Specifically, the difference between the best performing and average performing firms are incredibly wide. Venture is a hits business and if you think about a typical venture fund of almost any size having somewhere between 25 – 40 investments, the chances of any one of those investments being a true outlier and returning a multiple of the fund are quite small. In order to have a successful fund, it’s almost a requirement that you have an outlier return for at least one of your investments (see below the chart for the math).</p>

<p>Some quick math highlights why this is the case. For example, assume a $100M fund with 30 investments. That’s a little over $3M per investment, and while there is some dispersion from the average across companies in a fund, it’s not a bad way to model it. But from the outcomes chart above (the first one) we know that on average only 1 (actually just fewer than 1) company in that group of 30 will return between 10x and 20x. And less than 1 will return 20x or greater (I’m using the company averages, the dollar averages are on a per round basis, which would make these numbers even worse). A 20x returner for a fund that on average invests $3-$3.5M in a company doesn’t return that fund. Taking the most aggressive end of these numbers would still only have this one company returning 70% of the fund’s capital. If you were going to have several of these, of course, that would work out for your fund. IRR will depend on the timing of cash flows but as a quick rule of thumb, venture funds look to return at least 3 times the invested capital – after fees, so more like 3.5x on a gross basis. That’s pretty hard to do without a true outlier return (50x+) and/or consistency of 10x+ returns that is simply hard to generate. And here’s where the dispersion comes in. The best funds do have multiple companies that return in that range. Or higher. But that means the median fund doesn’t have any. And that is why the average venture fund isn’t actually a particularly good investment and also why so many venture funds fail to return capital.</p>



<p>I thought about this a couple of years ago when <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2018/04/whats-the-optimal-portfolio-strategy-for-a-venture-fund.html">I wrote about the optimal venture fund strategy</a> and my conclusion was that venture firms should place more bets and have more exposure across a larger set of businesses. Obviously, those inside the industry argue that managers who are good at picking businesses would do better to own more of fewer businesses if they can show that they have the aptitude to invest in those that become true outliers. But given how rare they are, I wonder if that is arguably the optimal strategy. As David Cohen replied once years ago when I asked him what the key to being a successful venture capitalist was: “Luck”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				












<h2>Background</h2>



<p>You would think that starting or sustaining at anything is hard enough, right? But once you do start and once you do keep doing it, assuming that there’s an actual end to it, you’d expect it to be easy, no? Since you overcame the static friction and (hopefully) managed to do it for long enough to bring it to closure, finalizing the thing (whatever the thing is) should be a no brainer, right?</p>



<p>WRONG! </p>



<p>I can tell you, firsthand, that you are so damn wrong. Doubly so if you are somewhere high on the perfectionist spectrum.</p>



<p>Finishing a task, finalizing a project or wrapping up your bachelor thesis – they all come with specific set of issues. And this article is all about tackling them.</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>I finished all my exams and was discussing with my mentor which subject to tackle for my thesis work. Everything run by so fast and I just felt like I never gave my 100%. I did pretty good overall but I just felt like I never demonstrated my best. This was a time to make up for that.</p>



<p>“How much time do I actually have to submit this thesis?”. It was around late February.</p>



<p>“Well, the latest you have is by October, but I’d strongly suggest you to aim for June. No need to drag it any further than that”.</p>



<p>Almost eight months in worst case. Hell, even if I wrote half a page a day, I could tackle this in three months. EASILY.</p>



<p>Now, you have to understand that, by being a perfectionist and if you’re reading this – you probably are one, <span>you tend to categorize tasks in two categories — ULTRA IMPORTANT or NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL</span>. The latter ones are fine – you probably don’t need this article to have those tackled. But the ones that you categorize as ULTRA IMPORTANT, well hell’s bells, <span>unless you apply some tools of the trade, those tasks are doomed to last FOREVER</span>.</p>



<p>Needless to say in which category did my thesis end up, right? It was my personal work of art, expressed by letters being grouped into words. Every chapter would be a mind blowing one. Every comma had a pure holistic reasoning behind it. It was my terrestrial legacy to all of the readers and all future generations to come.</p>



<p>Two months and, I kid you not, all I had was a title. Well, a rather good one I should say – “Using audio-fingerprinting technique for the purpose of identification and categorization of an audio sample”. But still, it’s ALL I had in TWO months. And it wasn’t even written in a required format, but rather hanging in my notes app. At least it ticked all of my shitboxes – it sounded holistic and I’m sure the academia would fall over it’s butt once I released it to wilderness …</p>



<p>“Okay”, I thought, “at least I have a month to wrap it up. I can do two pages a day or so and I’ll be good to go”. What a dumb-ass thinking it was …</p>



<p>I’d like to say that it took me a month to finish, but that’d be a lie. It took me seven months and twenty eight days of randomly writing thoughts here and there, widening and narrowing down all the topics that I’d love to cover … And the clock was actively working against me. The paranoia started kicking in. Frankly, I probably would never even have finished it if it wasn’t for my professor who contacted me in late September to tell me that I have two days to deliver a finished and printed version. He loved the progress and he approved everything that I covered so far, but he needed it finished. F*ck!</p>



<p>Not only did I finish the whole thesis in 48 hours (I was literally writing the day and night; the only time when I wasn’t writing was during the 8 hours when I had work to attend to), but it turned out pretty good! Probably not how I envisioned it, but regardless. And I liked it.</p>



<p>Now, I would love to say that I learned my lesson here and that my master thesis took a different course. Not exactly. However, I’ve learned a trick – <span>I wrote the intro and conclusion before I wrote the middle part</span>. Combined with a fixed deadline, it actually did wonders. And I’ll elaborate on that now …</p>



<h2>The “Life’s Work” problem</h2>



<p>You know, I’m not exactly sure if this is just my problem or a rather generic one. I would bet on the latter.</p>



<p><span>Be it a thesis, a short-term task or a whole project that you are working on, we tend to believe that it just has to be perfect. Good enough is not good enough</span>. But, why so?</p>



<p>I can’t speak for everyone, but when it comes to me, I actually think that I’m afraid of being judged. Especially for something that I do care about. I’m afraid that someone is going to look at what I did and just be like “meh, it’s okay”, or “meh, it could have been better”. The sheer thought of that scares the living shit out of me.</p>



<p>Obviously, the only way of preventing someone from judging you (yes, YOU!) is to make it your life’s work. Pour all time and energy into it, trying to make it perfect.</p>



<p>And you know what’s the problem with “life’s work”? You either drop dead before you’re finished, or you give up on it. But one thing is guaranteed – they take shitload of time and you probably miss bunch of other opportunities in the process. Worst of all? <span>Once you do do finish (assuming that you do so), and once the initial excitement wears of, you realize that it wasn’t even that important in the first place</span>. It becomes yet another “meh, it’s okay” on your shelf. And you move on, determined not to repeat the same mistake again.</p>



<h2>Deadline as a medium of creative drive</h2>



<p>You know, I’m a programmer. And I’ve been so my whole life. And <span>if there is ONE thing that is guaranteed to trigger my vomit reflex it has to be the mention of a “deadline”</span>. Seriously.</p>



<p>Yet, <span>I would lie if I told you that there’s been anything remotely more efficient than having a fixed deadline</span>. The date when you have to have your project finished, or the date when you have to turn your homework or thesis in.</p>



<p>You would assume that NOT having a deadline is a proper way to fire up your creative juices, right? Because, putting a TIMELINE on a creative work beats the purpose of creativity, right? </p>



<p>Wrong. Partially, at least.</p>



<p>If you haven’t done so already, I’d strongly suggest you go and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=UIM1mGMSpj&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creativity, Inc</a>. It’s written by Ed Catmull, a guy who happens to be a brain behind 3D graphics and many of the Pixar’s cartoons. He also happens to be a President of Disney’s animation studio. </p>



<p>He argues that the deadlines are THE BEST way to bring your creativity to anything that is useful. Like, you know, a Toy Story for example. And how so? Well, by treating it as a medium, and not as a whip. You set a deadline for a check-up, but you don’t threaten people with being beaten if they miss it. You have people commit to deliver SOMETHING by the fixed date and then you decide how to proceed. Rinse &amp; repeat until it’s perfect!</p>



<p><span>But, what do you do if you DON’T have a fixed deadline (e.g. you’re working on your personal pet project, like, a blog post for example)? Well, you MAKE one</span>! And just to ensure that you do have actual stakeholders waiting for the “outcome”, you make a public commitment!</p>



<h2>Public Commitment as a viable alternative</h2>



<p>If you’ve been following my “work” on Instagram or LinkedIn, you probably have noticed that I usually publish a screenshot of the new article that I’m starting to work on. And you might have been wondering, and rightfully so, WHY am I doing that? What’s the purpose of publishing a screenshot of an unpublished article?</p>



<p>That is my public commitment! That is how I make an artificial deadline and how I make you a stakeholder. By publishing the screenshot, I’m passively announcing that I’m working on something new and that you should expect the final version soon. And there it is. My artificial 5-days deadline is set and my creative juices are on fire now!</p>



<p><span>So, in case that you want to work on ANYTHING that doesn’t have a strong deadline, go and make one</span>! If you’re about to embark on a diet – announce that you are planning to “lose X kilograms by …..”. If you’re working on a task, tell your boss that you will be finished by next week. Or, if you’re about to start blogging … well, announce it! Make your public commitment and then, the only thing that you’ll be left with is – having to do it 🙂 Because, you wouldn’t want to be a liar, wouldn’t you? 🙂</p>



<h2>Your turn!</h2>



<p>Whatever it is that you are working on (or planning to do), go and announce WHEN will it be finished! Make a PUBLIC COMMITMENT. Make artificial stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong>You don’t have to make it PUBLIC PUBLIC</strong> though. Sharing it with your inner circle, your family or, you know, your boss, is absolutely OK as well. <span>What’s important is that<strong> you commit to at least one person </strong>and that person has to keep you accountable</span>!</p>



<p>I guarantee that once you scratch the power that lies under the surface of public commitment, you’ll have hard time NOT finishing anything ever again!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Be it a task, a project, a thesis or a general goal that you want to achieve, putting end to what you started is as complex as starting and sustaining at it is. Combined with a “life’s work” problem where we tend to categorize things as ultimate expression of our creativity and skilfulness, we have a perfect recipe for a never-ending crusade.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to tackle this is a battle tested method of a deadline and commitment. Commit yourself either to your best friend or by announcing it publicly, and do make sure to create stakeholders and set expectations. This, in turn, will be one of the best driving forces both to keep you on track of what matters and to ensure that you are actually going to close.</p>



<p>Good luck and let me know how you did!</p>



<h2>Useful resources</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have that many resources directly related to the subject of “finishing” things. Hence, I will recommend some of the things that, among other things, tackle some of the topics that I wrote about:</p>



<ul><li>Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull – it’s not a self-help book but it deals with the topic of creativity and how Pixar achieved it. You’ll get to …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I have a problem with this blog. It used to be powered by Wordpress, but the <bbr title="Content Management System">CMS pissed me off without end over the years, so I migrated to Hugo. That fixed a lot of the problems, except the main one: it is still (mostly) a Wordpress style blog, in which posts are fat content pieces of content, consisting of a  title and at least one paragraph of text. This is utterly unsuitable for things like posting status updates or sharing thoughts. Twitter does way better here, but it’s a proprietary platform, I’m not willing to bind myself to.</bbr></p>

<p>So, how about Mastodon then? Looks like Twitter, works like Twitter, but is federated and sadly, also a lost cause.</p>

<h2 id="the-thing-mastodon-gets-wrong">The thing, Mastodon gets wrong</h2>

<p>To me, it seems like Mastodon is trying to be a social network, while, ironically, completely failing to understand the network effect. It’s the right tool for the wrong people (or the wrong tool for the right people? I don’t know).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, what we want is a platform where you can have an intelligent conversation, where our privacy is respected and where we stay in control. But that’s not at all the audience, social media is build for. The ecosystem is entirely structured around all those gone gaga self promoters and would be celebrities that have nothing to contribute except “themselves” and are willing to sacrifice any last piece of dignity, if only it increases their following, so they have a number to show to their sponsors. The deal influencers enter is simple: bring in two new followers to the platform, get (an old) one for free. Keep any of the money, you may make from sponsors. Now go and post pictures of your lunch before (and after) you eat it.</p>

<p>
  
  <span>An ugly truth about building a better mousetrap</span>
  
  
It's the shitty parts, that made the original design so successful.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>And that in a nutshell is why Mastodon is going to fail: it simply is not build for the people who bring in other people, as it lacks any reward mechanism for multipliers. Social media is (and has to be) inherently anti-privacy in order to allow for monetizing “my personal life”. A commodity, available to everyone without any skill requirement to exploit, so there’s no shortage of dipshits, willing to take the deal. Most fail, but even in doing so, still promote the networks.</p>

<h2 id="quo-vadis">Quo vadis</h2>

<p>So, Mastodon has a choice. Either continue on the path of mimicking Twitter (without getting the crucial part right) and stay a niche product. Or (actively) attract marketeers, influencers and other attention whores, by promising them an audience while becoming a federated ad platform.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s not for me.</p>

I’m weird.</p><h2 id="what-is-cryptoart">What is cryptoart?</h2><p>There’s no universally accepted definition of cryptoart. For now, let’s use this:</p><blockquote><p>Cryptoart is art that uses blockchain technology in its creation and/or distribution.</p></blockquote><h2 id="okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">Okay, so what is blockchain technology?</h2><p>Think of blockchains as giant spreadsheets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that can be viewed by anyone.

        <p>The way the internet has evolved, at least how people search for information, is search engines.&nbsp; Most phones, which is what the majority of the world uses to browse the internet, like computers did back in the day, come preinstalled with browsers and search engines.&nbsp; Some even come installed with social networks.</p><p>Now this is in part by design and in part by the fact that it was the simplest solution at the time because it was the best.&nbsp; Take for example when google came out.&nbsp; All the other search engines, looked spamish, and generally their results where not too great.</p><p>Along comes google, giving you a new authority engine.&nbsp; Then out of no where there is a nice simple way to search for things on the internet instead of having to type in a domain and hope some one developed it.</p><p>This was awesome, and still probably is.&nbsp; But as more and more people started using the internet, also came the copious amount of volume that humans produce also needing to be indexed and ranked via authority. </p><p>This is generally helpful as most people trust the top search results now a days of most search engines.&nbsp; So how does this lead for social networks dominance.&nbsp; Well, let's assume that some one doesn't have FaceBook or similar.&nbsp; They get brand new access to a phone or something, and do a simple search.&nbsp; </p><p>Now FaceBook, Amazon, Harvard, all have authority.&nbsp; They are "trusted" sourced of content on the internet.&nbsp; There are of course others, but I'm trying to keep things simple. The only difference is Harvard does not have the entire world population able to post on it.<br></p><p>So by default if someone, qualified, or not, was to write something on FaceBook about a subject.&nbsp; Just by the amount of clout that FB has due to the number of other sites linking to it in the world, and the speed at which the site loads, on top of the fact that the parts that are exposed are also designed to be optimized for a search engine means that any new potential visitor is most likely going to land on that site.</p><p>So by therefor all new internet users end up visiting some of the major authorities on the internet that basically made it easier for humans to be able to post and publish things, ie becoming an indeterminate.&nbsp; </p><p>And since humans are far more creative in collective than any one human can be, by being the source of where people can publish things for sale, or thoughts, it by algorithmic process leads to the situation we are in.&nbsp; Of course there are ways to get around this, but that's not for today.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have taken a couple terabytes of photos over the years, and have a mild phobia of deleting data, so I keep my photos on a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology DiskStation NAS</a>. I’ve got all the files on the thing:</p><ul><li>backed up to the cloud</li><li>encrypted,</li></ul><p>because back in 2016, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpgY9zAGbD/">apartment was broken into and thieves took all the electronics</a>. I’ve been slightly paranoid ever since.</p><p>The Synology NAS generally works pretty well, but the interface for decrypting a drive after booting is <em>extremely</em> painful. It’s about 10 clicks, a username, two different passwords, and a UI that is kinda wonky (it’s a desktop in a web browser)? Here’s a screengrab:</p><figure><video alt="Unlocking an encrypted drive in the Synology DiskStation UI" src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/decrypt.mp4" width="588" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><p>22 seconds is my personal speed record.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There are alternative solutions to this – you can set it up so that it <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_encrypt_and_decrypt_shared_folders_on_my_Synology_NAS#t4_1">reads the encryption key from a USB disk on startup, for example</a> – but, if I’m worried about the whole thing being stolen, it’s not a good idea to leave the encryption keys plugged into the thing, and it’s also not a nice UX to find and plug in a USB before turning the thing on.</p><p>This… seems kinda silly to me, and something that should be solvable with ✨ <em>technology</em> ✨. I’m only ever accessing this from one computer, for example, and every modern operating system has a good credential storage system (think <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac"><em>Keychain Access</em></a> on OSX or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0"><em>Credential Manager</em></a> on Windows 10). So, maybe my computer could take care of supplying encryption keys to the DiskStation!</p><p>I went looking for options, and discovered that the DiskStation Software has a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf">publicly-documented web API (pdf)</a>. At least, a <em>mostly</em> publicly documented web API – there’s no documentation for the methods to mount and unmount encrypted shares.</p><p>That web API is <em>also</em> used by the desktop software though! So it should theoretically be possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser devtools</a> to see exactly <em>what</em> is being sent to the DiskStation. 🤔</p><p>So, I clicked on all the right things in the Web UI, got to the bit where you type in the password, opened the devtools to the “Network Requests” tab, typed in <code>abc123</code> as my password, hit “send” and then watched for the requests:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/encryption-dot-cgi.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing a request to an ominously-named 'encryption.cgi'"><figcaption><p>hmmmmmmmmmmm</p></figcaption></figure><p>Hmmm, that <code>encryption.cgi</code> looks a little ominous. I wonder what’s in it?</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/public-key.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing huge blob of base16-encoded public-key"><figcaption><p>Yep, looks like encryption, alright</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, a public key. And then the web interface loads a spinner, and makes a request to <code>entry.cgi</code>. Let’s take a look at the contents of that request:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ciphertext.png" alt="A devtools screenshot, showing a jumbled blob of base64-encoded data with the phrases 'rsa' and 'aes' sprinkled throughout."><figcaption><p>HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so if we want to send a magic request to mount the encrypted share, it’s not going to be enough to supply the encryption password; we’re also going to need to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> supply it – how to <em>encrypt</em> the encryption password, so to speak.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-this-crypto-system">So, what is this crypto system?</h2><p>Right. Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>First, we fetch the <code>public_key</code> from the server. That’s the call to the <code>encryption.cgi</code> endpoint we saw earlier. This isn’t actually the entire public key, it’s only <em>part</em> of it. In fact, this is a 4096-bit integer, encoded in base-16. The <em>other</em> part of the public key is the number <code>0x10001 == 65537</code>, which is hardcoded into the JavaScript.</li><li>Then, we generate 501 bytes worth of random text from the charset <code>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-/</code> (that’s 77 different possible characters; I have no idea why this set was chosen though!).</li><li>We encrypt that random text using our public key. The encryption method is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2">RSA with PKCS1.5 padding</a>.</li><li>We MD5-hash that random text a bunch of times with an 8-byte salt. The end result of this is 48 bytes which certainly <em>look</em> pretty random to the naked eye.</li><li>We split those 48 bytes into two components – a 32-byte (== 256-bit) key, and a 16-byte initialisation vector.</li><li>Remember the password we typed in? Yeah, I’d forgotten about it too! But now, we <em>finally</em> take that password, and encrypt it with AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCSv7 padding, using the 256-bit key and 16-byte IV we derived in the previous step.</li><li>We bundle the RSA ciphertext, the 8-byte salt, and the AES ciphertext together and ship them across to the DiskStation.</li></ul><p>Still with me? It’s ok if that didn’t all make loads of sense yet; we’ll now go over the interesting bits more closely.</p><h3 id="symmetric--asymmetric-ciphers">Symmetric / Asymmetric Ciphers</h3><p>Fundamentally, we’re using two cryptographic algorithms in concert:</p><ul><li><strong>RSA</strong>: RSA is an <em>asymmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric cryptographic systems have two <em>keys</em> – a public key, which allows only for encryption of the data, and a private key, which allows for both encryption <em>and</em> decryption.</li><li><strong>AES</strong>: AES is a <em>symmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. In symmetric cryptography, all parties have the same key, and that key allows you to both encrypt and decrypt.</li></ul><p>It seems weird that we’re using both of these at the same time, right? But both systems have weaknesses, and mixing them together is an attempt at minimising the disadvantages of both schemes.</p><p>The problem with <em>symmetric</em> crypto systems by themselves is that you need a way to get that one key to every party that needs it. But you can’t just <em>send</em> it to them, because you don’t have a secure channel yet! Your options are:</p><ul><li>Share the key over a different trusted channel beforehand, or</li><li>have both parties derive the same shared key (from e.g. some partial data that they negotiate over the wire beforehand).</li></ul><p>Asymmetric crypto doesn’t have this problem – if you’re able to share a key that can only be used for encrypting and not for decrypting, then the decryption keys never have to leave the recipient machine. You can then encrypt some text, and nobody except for the recipient can decrypt it – not even you! Put it on the internet, write it on a banner attached to the back of a propeller plane – the message will only be readable by the intended recipient.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/your-ciphertext-here.jpg" alt="A propeller plane with a banner reading 'your ciphertext here'"></figure><p>Asymmetric cryptography is <em>slow</em>, though, so doing it for lots of data is going to really hurt performance.</p><p>A common solution is to simply <em>make up</em> a symmetric key, perform some symmetric encryption using that key, then encrypt <em>that</em> key using asymmetric cryptography, and deliver both to the remote party. Then, the remote party can:</p><ul><li>First, perform asymmetric decryption to obtain the symmetric key</li><li>Then, use that symmetric key to decrypt the rest.</li></ul><p>That’s what <em>this</em> particular system is doing. ✨</p><h3 id="a-quick-note-about-rsa">A quick note about RSA</h3><p>I don’t know much about how RSA works, but as part of researching this article I discovered that it’s pretty easy to implement badly, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">extremely difficult to implement well</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/rsa-correct.gif" alt="Two developers correctly implement RSA, 2010, colorised"><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwzHm6buB8">Two developers correctly implement RSA</a>, 2010, colorised</p></figcaption></figure><p>As software developers, we spend a lot of time shipping things once they get to a point of “it looks like it works”. <strong>You can’t take that approach with cryptography</strong>, and because everything is so opaque, it’s a lot easier to declare that your implementation works without realising that it’s missing fundamentals. Like correctness, for example.</p><h3 id="lets-talk-about-random-keyslets-talk-about-you-and-me">Let’s talk about random keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h3><p>Recall that this algorithm is generating 501 random bytes from a 77-character set, and encrypting that with RSA. 501 seemed like an oddly specific number to me; here’s the specific set of circumstances that characterise <em>why</em> we’re generating a string of this length.</p><p>RSA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"><em>block cipher</em></a>, which means it operates on distinct fixed-size blocks of input and produces fixed-size blocks of output. How big can each block be? Well, RSA public keys are made up of two numbers: a (very large) modulus <code>n</code>, and a much smaller exponent <code>e</code>. RSA is capable of encrypting any message that’s smaller than <code>n</code> if you convert it to a number. In our case, we said that our modulus was a seemingly-random 4096-bit integer – that means (approximately) that we can encrypt 512-byte blocks.</p><p>There’s an important implication here: if you don’t have enough input for a block, you need to fill it up somehow. Normally this is called a <em>padding scheme</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in block-based cryptography.</p><p>Now, the system on this NAS in particular uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2.1">PKCS1-v1.5 padding</a>, which prepends the message (before encryption) with 3 bytes of headers <em>plus</em> a minimum of 8 bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of random garbage. That makes 11 bytes out of a 512 byte block, which means we’ve got… 501 bytes left for our message. ✨</p><h3 id="lo-fi-key-derivation">Lo-fi key derivation</h3><p>So… we’ve got this 501-byte string, with each character being one of 77 possibilities, and we think we know <em>why</em> it was chosen to be 501 bytes long. But that’s not going to work for AES-encrypting the password:</p><ul><li>AES requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. That’s 16, 24, or 32 bytes respectively, but we’ve got <em>lots</em> more than that.</li><li>We can’t, however, just take a subset of bytes from the text and go from there – because they’re selected from a narrow subset of possible bytes (77 out of 255!), you’d be losing an <em>enormous</em> amount of entropy in the key, making the encrypted text about 44,000,000,000,000,000 times<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> easier to break.</li></ul><p>These constraints need to be managed. We can smooth over both by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a>, based on repeated rounds of MD5 hashing and concatenating. Hash algorithms, in general, are good for this because they map input data to… not random, but random-<em>looking</em> output data.</p><p>I like to think of hashing as “entropy laundering” – if you’ve got 256 bits of entropy in a 16kB file, taking the first 256 bits will give you only 64 bits of entropy. If you hash the whole 16kB file, then the entropy goes back up to the maximum of the entropy in the file and the entropy provided by the hash algorithm. This works because hash algorithms are designed to exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche effect</a>.</p><p>I do <em>not</em> have the tools or experience to evaluate whether this specific scheme is secure or not (this one seems esoteric, and the <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure">use of MD5 is scary</a>!)… so let’s move briskly on.</p><h3 id="aes-encryption">AES-encryption</h3><p>Finally, after a bunch of outdated and somewhat esoteric primitives, we’re back to something that is <em>good</em> and <em>works</em> and <em>only slightly</em> a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">loaded footgun</a> and is <em>still recommended for widespread use!</em> It’s AES with a 256-bit key.</p><p>AES is our symmetric cipher. Like RSA, it operates on blocks of fixed length. <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66314/whats-the-best-block-cipher-mode-of-operation-for-rsa/66321#66321">Unlike RSA</a>, these blocks can be chained together. The strategies to do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">“Block cipher modes of operation”</a>, and AES implementations ship with a number of them. The problem is, this means you have access …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="eks-dns-at-scale-and-spikeiness">EKS DNS at scale and spikeiness</h2>
<p><em>This is a guest post by&nbsp;Vlad Ionescu for Ownzones.</em></p>
<p>In his post we will discuss the issue of DNS errors at scale, that is, several hundreds to thousands of nodes, showing how the problems can be mitigated. This was an obstacle that affected Ownzones for several months and a problem that we expect everybody at scale will encounter. Two solutions will be proposed and their implementation will be discussed. Troubleshooting steps are shared for easy identification of the problem.</p>
<p>Ownzones is a pioneering technological force that’s transforming the OTT industry with ground-breaking innovations. Our product Ownzones Connect is a cloud-native platform, which leverages our proprietary technology as well as the best tools in the industry to provide studios an agile, low-cost solution for global distribution and localization. Some of the key features include the world’s first fully cloud-based, parallel processing IMF transcoder.</p>
<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>At Ownzones, we run our applications in containers for increased developer velocity. Due to rather intense scaling requirements — a multi-TB movie comes in and needs to be processed as soon as possible — the decision was made to use Kubernetes for container orchestration. Since we are running in AWS, we make use of the amazing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> or EKS for short. We leverage other AWS services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">Amazon ElastiCache</a>, and more. We manage all the services and infrastructure configuration in code with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and we practice gitops with <a href="https://www.runatlantis.io/">Atlantis</a>.</p>
<p>The EKS clusters are running version 1.12 and we are in the process of upgrading all our clusters to 1.13. Each cluster has a different configuration depending on the customer needs for scale, but all of them scale a lot. As soon as jobs come in — be they transcoding jobs, media analysis jobs, deliveries, or anything else — the EKS clusters are scaled up by cluster-autoscaler. At peak, clusters may scale to hundreds or thousands of nodes to process the work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The problems started to appear when customers or internal testing teams were scaling the system to higher limits, such as when transcoding or using FrameDNA to analyze large films or libraries of content. When the Kubernetes cluster was doing intense work and scaling above several hundreds of nodes, the processing time was stagnating or increasing. Having built a cloud native solution, the expectation was that adding additional processing power would lower the processing time.</p>
<p>We quickly established a cross-functional task force to investigate this issue.</p>
<p>A multitude of tools are used for observability at Ownzones: <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a> for events and traces, Sysdig for monitoring, Papertrail for logs, <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> for error tracking, and more. Investigation into traces from Honeycomb showcased DNS resolution times taking seconds or more:</p>

</figure>

<p>In some cases DNS lookups were taking multiple seconds:</p>

            <p>Sometimes DNS resulution spiked to multiple seconds</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking further into network metrics showed DNS errors spiking while work was being processed and recovering when the work was finished:</p>

            <p>DNS errors spiking when work was happening</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The culprit was identified: when reaching a certain scale, a significant number of DNS errors (<code>EAI_AGAIN</code> and <code>ENOTFOUND</code>) that were leading to a lot of retries. Operations that were supposed to take a couple minutes were taking orders or magnitude longer. For example, transcoding a single 4K feature film in Ownzones Connect takes around 16 minutes. During this time, the EKS cluster is scaled to hundreds of nodes, which are peaking at 1.64 TB/s network traffic to S3 and 8.55k requests per second to S3.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is for a single video track! Processing files in massively parallel ways is where cloud native approaches shine and Ownzones Connect is fully taking advantage of that. The result is a massive spike of work and DNS traffic. Having multi-second lookup times when doing 8.550 requests per second to S3 adds up to quite a lot.</p>
<p>Since the cause was narrowed down to DNS, the next step was to contact AWS Support.&nbsp;The DNS issues were appearing at scale and spiky workloads were especially affected. After investigation by AWS it was confirmed that the VPC networking was not experiencing elevated error rates, nor was S3.&nbsp;It was pointed out that due to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-limits">Amazon VPC DNS Limits</a> of 1024 packets per second per network interface the EKS-default 2 CoreDNS pods can be quickly overloaded. Each CoreDNS pod has to serve DNS traffic from the host through its own elastic network interface, which is limited to 1024 packets per second.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-one-increasing-coredns-pods">Attempt one: increasing CoreDNS pods</h3>
<p>The first and easiest improvement for DNS failures was to increase the number of CoreDNS pods. By default EKS has two replicas and that can be increased:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl scale deployment/coredns \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --current-replicas=2 \
    --replicas=10
</code></pre><p>At Ownzones, we run both on On-Demand Instances as well as on Spot Instances. This is not ideal as CoreDNS pods could be scheduled on a Spot Instance, which may be terminated at any time and potentially add disruption.</p>
<p>To work around this we edited the CoreDNS deployment to only run on On-Demand EC2 instances which we have tagged with the <code>stable</code> label:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl --namespace kube-system edit deployment/coredns

    ...
    spec:
        affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: beta.kubernetes.io/os
                operator: In
                values:
                - linux
                - key: beta.kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values:
                - amd64
                - key: nodegroup
                operator: In
                values:
                - stable
        containers:
            ...

</code></pre><p>Scaling the CoreDNS pods was an improvement, but we still saw significant error rates. We had thousands of nodes sending network traffic to 10 CoreDNS pods, which were spread on significantly fewer On-Demand nodes.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-two-node-local-dns">Attempt two: Node-local DNS</h3>
<p>Kubernetes developers have an addon that addresses the DNS problem: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns">NodeLocal DNS Cache</a>. Using this addon, a new CoreDNS DaemonSet can be configured so it runs on each node. Those new CoreDNS pods will act as a DNS cache: all pods on a specific node would have their requests sent to the local CoreDNS pod which would either serve a result from cache or forward the request upstream to the main CoreDNS pods.</p>
<p>This massively lowers the volume of DNS queries and makes spike handling a breeze and follows <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dns-resolution-failures-ec2-linux/?nc1=h_ls">the AWS recommendation to cache DNS</a>.&nbsp;The first step is to decide which IP will be used for NodeLocal DNS. Typically <code>169.254.20.10</code> is chosen.</p>
<p>With the IP address decided, the YAML files from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/release-1.15/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns">k/k/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns</a> need to be acquired. They cannot be applied directly as some values need to be replaced:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__PILLAR__DNS__DOMAIN__</code> with <code>cluster.local</code> as per <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/28845f97c05dacaf699a102faa690a4238b79f02/files/kubelet-config.json#L24">amazon-eks-ami’s kubelet-config.json.</a></li>
<li><code>__PILLAR__LOCAL__DNS__</code> with <code>169.254.20.10</code>, which is like the default address chosen above that the Node-local DNS will bind to on each node.</li>
<li><code>__PILLAR__DNS__SERVER__</code> with <code>10.100.0.10</code> or <code>172.20.0.10</code> depending on the VPC CIDR. <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/ca61cc2bb6ef6fe982cc71ede7552a4a2c6b93e9/files/bootstrap.sh#L167-L170">On EKS</a>, the DNS Service is running at one of the two IPs and the relevant one needs to be chosen. The value can be seen by running <code>kubectl -n kube-system get service kube-dns</code> and checking the cluster IP.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the values are replaced the files have to be applied:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl apply -f nodelocaldns.yaml
</code></pre><p>This is not enough: Node-local DNS was installed, but it is not used by the pods! To actually have the pods use Node-local DNS the kubelet running on each node needs to be configured. The DNS resolver for the pods needs to point to the newly created Node-local DNS server running at <code>169.254.20.10</code> on each node.</p>
<p>Users of the amazing <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a> project can easily configure this since <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/pull/550">support was added in February</a> by editing the node group definition:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">
...
<span>nodeGroups</span>:
- <span>name</span>: <span>mygroup</span>
    <span>clusterDNS</span>: <span>169.254.20.10</span>
...

</code></pre></div><p>Users of <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks">the Terraform community EKS module</a> have to send an extra parameter to the <code>kubelet</code> binary in the worker group definition:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">
...
worker_groups_launch_template <span>=</span> [
    {
        ...
        name <span>=</span> <span>"mygroup"</span>
        kubelet_extra_args <span>=</span> "--node-labels<span>=</span>kubernetes.io/lifecycle<span>=</span>spot,nodegroup<span>=</span>mygroup --cluster-dns<span>=</span><span>169</span>.<span>254</span>.<span>20</span>.<span>10</span><span>"</span>
        ...
    },
    {
        ...
    },
]
...

</code></pre></div><p>That’s all!</p>
<p>At Ownzones, we have been running the above setup in production for more than 2 months on Amazon EKS and Kubernetes 1.12 with very good results. DNS errors have fallen drastically with 99% of DNS queries resolved in less than 2ms during stress-testing:</p>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-tips">Troubleshooting tips</h3>
<p>Identifying the need for a more in-depth DNS configuration is not straightforward. Debugging Node-local DNS is a task in itself that requires networking experience and familiarity with networking in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>To lower the time investment, we can share two pointers that would have helped us a lot when starting the investigation.</p>
<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
<p>Knowing how many CoreDNS replicas to use and knowing if NodeLocal DNS is needed are both two very hard questions. Prometheus and Grafana can showcase the relevant metrics on the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/7279">CoreDNS dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>While at Ownzones we debugged resolution issues with <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, a tracing solution combined with a rich monitoring setup will likely reach the same depth. An important point is for the investigation to happen …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>At <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, we’ve been knee-deep in a substantial refactor of our system for running payrolls.</p>

<p>Running a payroll requires taking several different inputs such as how much an employee should get paid, where did they work, how much did they work, how much taxes should they pay, how much taxes have they paid this year, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>As a company that offers a payroll service, keeping this piece of the system in tip-top shape is important for the business. Customers love Gusto for its simplicity and speed when it comes to running payroll.</p>

<p>Over the years, this system grew beyond its original mandate. Rather than just serve payroll for one state, it now serves them for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although customers love our payroll, internally new engineers had a difficult time understanding the code and making changes safely. This system needed a tune up, so we embarked on a sizable refactor.</p>

<p>Because the process of calculating what you need for a payroll is one big formula, we set the goal of making this system “more functional” as in functional programming. We wanted to take the process of calculating a payroll and make it one big stateless operation.</p>

<p>The server-side code at Gusto is written in Ruby, a language usually known for its object-oriented and metaprogrammatic roots. Nonetheless, we wanted to integrate some more functional concepts into our code in the hopes of increasing the system’s safety and clarity. The result has been maintainable code that is easier to reason about and safer to change.</p>

<h2 id="embracing-the-pfaao">Embracing the PFaaO</h2>

<p>Ruby is an expressive language, but it does not lend itself to some common functional practices. Although Ruby allows for closures and first-class functions via <code>Proc</code>s, one does not see many <code>Proc</code>s passed around as objects in idiomatic Ruby.</p>

<p>Throughout our work, we discovered that you can create expressive interfaces with clean internals by embracing both OO and functional aspects of Ruby.</p>

<p>To do this, we used a pattern called <a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/ruby/pure-function-as-an-object-PFAAO-pattern/">Pure Function as an Object (PFaaO)</a>. Essentially, you design objects as you would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> but dress them up as Ruby classes.</p>

<p>A pure function is a function without observable side effects that always returns the same value for a given set of inputs. That means no talking to the database, no modifying the state of other objects, no accessing the system clock, etc. When we write a PFaaO in Ruby, we want to build an object that has no side effects.</p>

<p>A simple PFaaO might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>).</span><span>calculate</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@payroll</span> <span>=</span> <span>payroll</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>private_class_method</span> <span>:new</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>
    <span>PayrollResult</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
      <span>payroll: </span><span>payroll</span><span>,</span>
      <span>paystubs: </span><span>paystubs</span><span>,</span>
      <span>taxes: </span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span>
      <span>debits: </span><span>debits</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s quite a bit going on here, so let’s break it down bit by bit.</p>

<p>First, our class has only one effective public interface: <code>PayrollCalculator.calculate</code>. Because we’ve declared the constructor private using <code>private_class_method :new</code>, the instance method <code>#calculate</code> is effectively private.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This means that all of the other instance methods we declare are implicitly private, even though there is no explicit <code>private</code> block within this class. Because there’s no way to <code>.new</code> up an instance, there is not a vector to call any instance methods.</p>

<p>Our method only has one public interface and its designed operation is effectively stateless, therefore we only need to exercise one interface in our tests. Put some data in, assert that the data coming out is what we expected.</p>

<h2 id="referential-transparency-for-free">Referential Transparency for Free</h2>

<p>In our above example, let’s say that the process of calculating taxes is expensive from a time perspective.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we want to make a time/space tradeoff to consume more memory to minimize the number of times we need to compute taxes. In our example, calculating both <code>#paystubs</code> and <code>#debits</code> will require the result of <code>#taxes</code>.</p>

<p>Now because each of these private methods is a pure function, we have referential transparency. This means we can replace a method and its parameters with its return value. Think of it like algebra: Given the function <code>f(x) = x + 5</code>, you can safely replace any occurrence of <code>f(2)</code> with the value <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for a Rubyist? Free and safe memoization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
  <span>calculate_paystubs</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
  <span>calculate_debits</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>@taxes</span> <span>||=</span> <span>calculate_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Memoization is a form of caching, and can be fraught with issues if the memoized value does not actually come from a pure function. But because we make everything within the PFaaO pure, we can safely memoize this method call.</p>

<p>This is interesting because it looks like this class is no longer stateless: it now assigns local values. However the only interface is the single <code>.calculate</code> class method, each instance of our PFaaO is single-use. Any intermediate state can never be accessed by externally. Because this cached state is not observable externally, our function is still technically pure.</p>

<p>Much in the way a developer can abstract synchronous and asynchronous behavior, you can do the same with functional purity. Any local state changes are irrelevant in the lifecycle of the PFaaO. These local state changes are not observable from the outside world.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-pfaaos">Expanding PFaaOs</h2>

<p>As I’ve grown in my career, I have become less interested in how software is written but how it is maintained. Software maintenance is the blessing and the curse of any successful project: <em>Congratulations!</em> You have a business with lasting value. <em>Our condolences!</em> You must now pay for all of your mistakes. Nonetheless, it is always preferred to have a business that exists with technical debt, than to have a bankrupt company with a pristine code base.</p>

<p>PFaaOs in Ruby are great because they are easy to maintain. Not only are they easy to test, but they are predisposed to healthy growth.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Let’s again take the example of our <code>#taxes</code> method. Early in Gusto’s history (back when it was still known as ZenPayroll), we only offered payroll services in California. Thus, we only needed to worry about payroll taxes for California.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, California is a simple state when it comes to payroll taxes. Our taxes method might have looked like nothing more than the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say we expanded into a new state, New York. Now our method grows a little bit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we expand into every state,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> this method will grow to be quite large! Furthermore, each of these methods adds to the length of our <code>PayrollCalculator</code> class. Without constant gardening, the class could become difficult to understand.</p>

<p>But because each of our methods within a PFaaO is itself a pure function, we are able to extract classes as we see fit and make each one a new PFaaO. We can safely replace our growing methods with new PFaaOs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we tease apart these different PFaaOs, we also get a much better idea of the input requirements for these service classes. Our <code>@payroll</code> is a large parameter object, and each extracted PFaaO probably only needs a subset of its data.</p>

<p>So we can get away with something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span>
    <span>@payroll</span><span>.</span><span>only_pay_and_location_data</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we assume that the <code>Payroll#only_pay_and_location_data</code> returns a slice of the total data within the instance as a new <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Object</a>. This Value Object represents only the data required to calculate the taxes part of running a payroll.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-immutable-by-default">Data is Immutable by Default</h2>

<p>Another important ingredient for scalable PFaaOs is the requirement that all data be immutable by default. <em>This is a drastic change from how most folks traditionally write Ruby.</em></p>

<p>Every time you reach for your <code>=</code>, you’ll need to replace it with a <code>#set</code> or <code>#put</code>. Rather than modifying objects in place, you will get used to returning new copies with new values. (<a href="https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/">Hamster</a>, which provides great immutable data structures, can help you from having to hand-roll FP functionality.)</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rails? It will often mean creating functions or classes that take <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects and convert them into immutable value objects. For us, we carve out these value objects into the namespace of what we’re doing. For example, here are the two representations of a payroll in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/models/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># app/services/payroll_calculator/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator::Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ValueObject</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of a payroll represents the data that lives in the database. It is a superset of the data required for actually running a payroll. Although they have the same name, they do not have the same attributes. For example, the <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of <code>Payroll</code> will have a <code>processed_at</code> attribute, whereas the <code>Payroll</code> that lives in the calculation domain does not.</p>

<p>In the words of <a href="https://kellysutton.com/2017/06/07/domain-driven-design.html"><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></a>, each namespace here is a different Bounded Context. We implement adapters to take <code>ActiveRecord</code> payrolls and turn them into <code>PayrollCalculator</code> payrolls, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The upside of this is the same that you might see in any other large system with well-defined abstractions; changes in models don’t cross domains. In our example, we can change the structure of the <code>Payroll</code> in our database without needing to change the calculation code. We would only need to change our adapter. Furthermore, this context is entirely separate from the machinations of Rails. We could easily and safely pull this into its own …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

    <p>In reality, an iceberg wouldn’t float <i>exactly</i> like this. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.</p>

The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks. I also caught the first wave of the e-ink revolution. Nothing beats a real book, in terms of textures and scents; but e-ink devices and the fantastic tools outlined here should make reading digital books much more palpable&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>I have been reading on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo%5FAura%5FHD">Kobo Aura HD</a> for almost a decade now, ever since its release. This means my setup is about as stable as its going to get in the near future. As good a time as any to collect my thoughts&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The focus is on e-ink devices and auxiliary tools; not on all digital content; so there are no mentions of syncing or reading on the go (with a phone) or of monitors which are good for reading on.</p><h3 id="the-content">The Content</h3><p>In general; my e-ink reading habits can be broadly broken into the following categories:</p><dl><dt>Light Reading</dt><dd>Practically this includes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami">anything I review on Goodreads</a>; these are not often re-read; nor read very deeply; since they are read for pleasure. They are however, rarely deleted</dd><dt>Required Reading</dt><dd>Anything which typically requires me to take notes or practice / write out proofs; these are most often considered to be either coursework (for someone somewhere) or research monographs. These are typically large (in size) and unwieldy (in that they often lack TOCs) and are read multiple times; with a focus on highlights and notes</dd><dt>Active Research</dt><dd>These are the most ephemeral of my reading habits; and also the most numerous; I do not typically store these on my e-reader; and rarely need to make notes on the reader&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.

                                                    <p>In hindsight, I can’t believe anyone paid money<sup id="fnref-516-v1"><a href="#fn-516-v1">1</a></sup> for the <a href="http://d20.blakewatson.com/">first version of d20</a>, which I released in <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/2016-my-year-in-review/#criticalhit"> September 2016</a>. But they did, and those few sells I made inspired a much more useful version 2, which was released in January 2018.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, I had been using d20 extensively and running into some problems I wanted to address. I started writing some brand new code in December of that year. Two years and 144 commits later, I’m happy to announce that d20 version 3 is now for sale on the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://d20app.me/">d20 website</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/d20-an-rpg-dice-roller/id1156311750">Mac App Store page</a> if you want to know more about the features. But I want to get into the decision making process, tech stack, and other tangents regarding the making of d20. Imagine this as the director’s commentary.</p>
<h2>Electron: can’t live with it, can’t live without it</h2>
<p>The biggest non-decision was whether the app would be powered by <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, go fully native, or go fully web-based. I had already used Electron for the first two versions. But I felt guilty about it. Electron is basically Google Chrome and NodeJS smashed together, so it’s pretty big and resource intensive. Seeing as d20 has a simple interface, very limited scope in what it’s trying to accomplish, and is meant to be Mac-only, Electron was a really terrible option.</p>
<p>But I went with Electron again for the same reason every other web developer does—I know how to code for it without learning too much new stuff (e.g., Swift + Apple frameworks). Yes it’s way overkill, yes it’s absolutely ridiculous. But you either get d20 the Electron app, or you get nothing. That’s the great thing about Electron. It lowers the barrier to creating desktop applications and spawns tools and apps that otherwise would not exist. You’ll have to endure a little bit of ridicule from Hacker News and, if you’re like me, your inner-critic, but I say YOLO. Don’t let your dreams be dreams.</p>
<h2>RANDOM.ORG</h2>
<p>Since version 2, d20 has integrated with <a href="https://www.random.org/">RANDOM.ORG</a> to provide true random numbers rather than pseudorandom ones generated by JavaScript. This ended up being the catalyst that pushed me to finish version 3. RANDOM.ORG brought their API out of beta and began charging for it. My old API key was no longer working and so d20 was quietly falling back to using pseudorandom JavaScript RNG.</p>
<p>This was not cool, considering that true random numbers is one of d20’s unique selling points. I made the decision to move to the commercial API, which costs $12 per month. I don’t like incurring the extra costs each month, but I do make enough in sales to cover it and it is personally one of my favorite features of d20; so I gotta keep it in there.</p>
<h2>Vue, Sass, Laravel Mix</h2>
<p>I doubled down on using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>. I had used it in version 2 but I was new to it at the time and I did a really poor job of code organization. I feel like the new version is much better. I’m a different programmer than I was when I first started d20 v3 so there are definitely things I would change if I were starting today (like using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>). That’s just part of the consequences for taking two years to finish it.</p>
<p>CSS is pretty amazing these days, but I went with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> out of complacency or momentum or whatever you want to call it. I processed all the styles and scripts with <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">Laravel Mix</a> which is a pretty great way to use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> when you don’t feel like learning about webpack<sup id="fnref-516-mix"><a href="#fn-516-mix">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Leaving behind <code>localStorage</code></h2>
<p>I have a bad habit of using <code>localStorage</code>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">web storage feature</a>, for everything. In d20 v2 I was saving all the presets in <code>localStorage</code>. But for v3 I moved to using a JSON file for saving presets and settings information. This is my first time using the file system in an Electron app so here’s hoping I did all of the Apple security stuff right.</p>
<p>The cool thing about this though is that it’s now much easier to back up your presets, move them to another machine, or share them with others. Just save the file. Boom. Easy. I will be able to rest easier knowing that I have reliable, persistent storage and that a user won’t wake up one day to find their data missing.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>These three images should give you an idea about the progression of UI design. Of course, I feel that the third version is far superior. I do think it’s funny how my color scheme seems to be trending pink-ward.</p>

<p>I take the UI design seriously and the lack of nicely designed dice rollers on the Mac App Store was a big reason I made d20 originally. I’m pretty happy with how it turned out and I’m hoping to start getting sales information from Apple really soon to find out whether users agree.</p>
<h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
<p>I said earlier that I was beginning to run up against problems in v2. Many of those I have addressed in v3.</p>
<p>One of the major ones is what I’m calling “multi-roll.” The easiest way to describe this is that it lets you roll attack and damage at the same time. Technically, what it is doing is letting you separate different formulas with a comma but roll them at the same time. This means that you can also <em>save</em> them together, which means that now you can have a weapon as a preset button and clicking will roll the attack and the damage simultaneously, with each having its own result entry.</p>
<p>Another big problem was that v2 presets were simplistic—just a list of buttons that each can roll one combo. If you have multiple characters, good luck rummaging through all your presets to find the ones you need.</p>
<p>I’m tackling this in v3 by introducing the concept of “preset groups,” which let you create different lists of presets (e.g., one per character). This plus multi-roll solve the biggest annoyances I had with v2.</p>
<h2>Submitting to the Mac App Store is hard</h2>
<p>Seriously, that was harder than building the app. There are a lot of articles recommending <code>electron-forge</code> but there’s not much help out there about what happens when something doesn’t work.</p>
<p>I ended up using its parts directly: <code>electron-packager</code>, <code>electron-osx-sign</code>, and <code>electron-osx-flat</code>. This topic deserves its own article probably but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a “Mac App Distribution” certificate from Apple.</li>
<li>You need a “provisioning profile” from Apple.</li>
<li>You need the entitlements files—I just grab these off of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide">Electron site</a>, but if the app needs any special entitlements, you have to add those. For example: <code>com.apple.security.network.client</code> if your app needs to hit the web for stuff.</li>
<li>You need to package the app with <code>electron-packager</code>, which requires you have the aforementioned Apple cert installed onto your keychain.</li>
<li>You need to sign the app with <code>electron-osx-sign</code>.</li>
<li>You need to turn the <code>.app</code> into an installer with <code>electron-osx-flat</code>.</li>
<li>You need to send the resulting installer to Apple using their app called Transporter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the three npm scripts I used to package, sign, and prep the installer for distribution on the Mac App Store:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "scripts": {
    "package": "electron-packager . d20 --out=out --platform=mas --arch=x64 --appBundleId=com.example.app_name --icon=./images/d20_icon --no-deref-symlinks --overwrite",
    "sign:mas": "electron-osx-sign out/d20-mas-x64/d20.app --entitlements=entitlements/parent.plist --entitlements-inherit=entitlements/child.plist --entitlements-loginhelper=entitlements/loginhelper.plist",
    "installer": "electron-osx-flat out/d20-mas-x64/d20.app --platform=mas"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>These resources helped me out a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide">https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://epxx.co/artigos/electronsign.html">https://epxx.co/artigos/electronsign.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-packager">electron-packager</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-osx-sign">electron-osx-sign</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Web vs app stores</h2>
<p>To be honest, I would have loved to just deploy d20 as a web app. But unfortunately it’s hard to get traffic to a web app versus getting the built-in audience an app store provides. It’s one thing to charge for a Mac app, but try to charge for a website that rolls dice and suddenly it seems ridiculous. I don’t know if there’s an app-store-like website for distributing web apps (<a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> maybe?) but I doubt a web version would have had the same success (10-20 copies sold per month) that the Mac App Store provides with $0 of marketing effort.</p>
<p>It’s a technical challenge building an Electron version and a web version from the same codebase, but providing some kind of web version is on my radar. As much as I would love to go cross-platform and distribute Windows and Linux versions, I don’t have a good way to test those platforms. And my specific setup for working on my Mac (which I need thanks to my disability) isn’t conducive to OS or device switching. But at least providing a web version would open it up to more platforms.</p>
<h2>By the numbers</h2>
<p>In conclusion, here are some random stats/numbers for your amusement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.5</strong> years on the Mac App Store</li>
<li><strong>203</strong> commits across all versions</li>
<li><strong>d1,000,000:</strong> the largest die d20 v3 can roll</li>
<li><strong>100:</strong> number of random integers d20 requests from RANDOM.ORG when you roll a die</li>
<li><strong>$3.99:</strong> the price of d20 v1</li>
<li><strong>04/2020:</strong> highest grossing month ($200)</li>
<li><strong>$3.41k</strong> in lifetime total sales (before Apple’s cut)</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<p>IDOM takes inspiration from <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, and wherever
possible, attempts to achieve parity with the features it copies more directly. Nowhere
is this more evident than the version of React's often lauded
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank">"Hooks"</a> that IDOM
implements in Python.</p>
<p>At a glance, the similarities between IDOM and React are rather striking. Below is a
React component which defines a simple <code>Counter</code> displaying the number of times a button
has been clicked:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-idom">Why Do We Need IDOM?</h2>
<p>Over the <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-angular-vs-vue" target="_blank">past 5
years</a> front-end
developers seem to have concluded that programs written with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGh0bjzj4IQ" target="_blank">declarative</a> style or
framework tend to be easier to understand and maintain than those done imperatively. Put
more simply, mutable state in programs can quickly lead to unsustainable complexity.
This trend is largely evidenced by the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190" target="_blank">rise</a>
of Javascript frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> and
<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> which describe the logic of computations
without explicitly stating their control flow.</p>
<p><img alt="npm download trends" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/npm-download-trends.png"></p>
<p>So what does this have to do with Python and IDOM? Well, because browsers are the de
facto "operating system of the internet", even back-end languages like Python have had
to figure out clever ways to integrate with them. While standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> APIs are well
suited to applications built using HTML templates, modern browser users expect a higher
degree of interactivity than this alone can achieve.</p>
<p>A variety of Python packages have since been created to help solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets" target="_blank">IPyWidgets</a> - Adds
  interactive widgets to <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://plotly.com/dash/" target="_blank">Dash</a> - Allows data scientists to produces
  enterprise-ready analytic apps</li>
<li><a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> - Turns simple Python scripts
  into interactive dashboards</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/" target="_blank">Bokeh</a> - An interactive visualization
  library for modern web browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>However they each have drawbacks that can make them difficult to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictive ecosystems</strong> - UI components developed for one framework cannot be
   easily ported to any of the others because their APIs are either too complex,
   undocumented, or are structurally inaccesible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imperative paradigm</strong> - IPyWidgets and Bokeh have not embraced the same declarative
   design principles pioneered by front-end developers. Streamlit and Dash on the
   otherhand, are declarative, but fall short of the features provided by React or Vue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited layouts</strong> - At their initial inception, the developers of these libraries
   were driven by the visualization needs of data scientists so the ability to create
   complex UI layouts may not have been a primary engineering goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A future article will address specific comparisons to each of the projects mentioned
above, but for now, we'll just focus on IDOM and its solutions to these problems.</p>
<h2 id="ecosystem-independence">Ecosystem Independence</h2>
<p>IDOM has a flexible set of core abstractions that allow it to interface with its peers.
At the time of writing, both Jupyter and Dash are supported, while Streamlit and Bokeh
are in the works:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-jupyter" target="_blank">idom-jupyter</a> (try it now
  with
  <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idom-team/idom-jupyter/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fintroduction.ipynb" target="_blank">Binder</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-dash" target="_blank">idom-dash</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By providing well defined interfaces and straighforward protocols, IDOM makes it easy to
swap out any part of the stack with an alternate implementation if you want to. For
example, if you need a different web server for your application, IDOM already has 3
options to choose from or, use as blueprints to create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic" target="_blank">Sanic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" target="_blank">Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado" target="_blank">Tornado</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can even target your usage of IDOM in your production-grade applications with IDOM's
Javascript <a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-client-react" target="_blank">React client library</a>. Just install
it in your front-end app and connect to a back-end websocket that's serving up IDOM
models. IDOM's own
<a href="https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> acts as
a prime example for this targeted usage - most of the page is static HTML, but embedded
in it are interactive examples that feature live views being served from a web socket:</p>

<h2 id="declarative-components">Declarative Components</h2>
<p>IDOM, by adopting the hook design pattern from React, inherits many of its aesthetic and
functional characteristics. For those unfamiliar with hooks, user interfaces are
composed of basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank">HTML elements</a> that are
constructed and returned by special functions called "components". Then, through the
magic of hooks, those component functions can be made to have state. Consider the
component below which displays a basic representation of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate" target="_blank">AND-gate</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>idom</span>

    <span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>toggle_state</span>

<span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>AndGate</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="and-gate-demo" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/and-gate.gif"></p>
<p>Here's a very high level summary of how it works... the first time a view of the
component above is rendered, the <code>AndGate</code> function is called where its initial <code>state</code>
for <code>input_1</code> and <code>input_2</code> is <code>False</code>. The function then returns a series of HTML
elements with callbacks that respond to client-side events. Machinery behind the scenes
subsequently realizes that declaration and displays two checkbox buttons with the text
<code>False AND False = False</code>. Later, when a user clicks the now visible checkbox buttons,
client-side events are triggered, the associated callbacks respond by inverting the old
<code>state</code> from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>, and a re-render of the component is scheduled. When
re-rendering, the function is again called, this time though, where <code>input_1</code> and
<code>input_2</code> have been updated to reflect the new <code>state</code>, thus causing the displayed text
to change.</p>
<p>In the code above, consider the fact that it never explicitely describes how to evolve
the frontend view when events occur. Instead, it declares that, given a particular
state, this is how the view should look. It's then IDOM's responsibility to figure out
how to bring that declaration into being. This behavior of defining outcomes without
stating the means by which to achieve them is what makes components in IDOM and React
"declarative". For comparison, a hypothetical, and a more imperative approach to
defining the same interface might look similar to the following:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>layout</span> <span>=</span> <span>Layout</span><span>()</span>

<span>def</span> <span>make_and_gate</span><span>():</span>

            <span>input_2</span><span>=</span><span>state</span><span>[</span><span>"input_2"</span><span>],</span>
            <span>output</span><span>=</span><span>state</span><span>[</span><span>"input_1"</span><span>]</span> <span>and</span> <span>state</span><span>[</span><span>"input_2"</span><span>],</span>

    <span>)</span>

<span>layout</span><span>.</span><span>add_element</span><span>(</span><span>make_and_gate</span><span>())</span>
<span>layout</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this imperative incarnation there are several disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactoring is difficult</strong> - Functions are much more specialized to their
   particular usages in <code>make_and_gate</code> and thus cannot be easily generalized. By
   comparison, <code>use_toggle</code> from the declarative implementation could be applicable to
   any scenario where boolean indicators are toggled on and off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No clear static relations</strong> - There is no one section of code through which to
   discern the basic structure and behaviors of the view. This issue is exemplified by
   the fact that we must call <code>update_output_text</code> from two different locations. Once in
   the body of <code>make_and_gate</code> and again in the body of the callback <code>toggle_input</code>.
   This means that, to understand what the <code>output_text</code> might contain, we must also
   understand all the business logic that surrounds it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Referential links cause complexity</strong> - To evolve the view, various callbacks must
   hold references to all the elements that they will update. At the outset this makes
   writing programs difficult since elements must be passed up and down the call stack
   wherever they are needed. Considered further though, it also means that a function
   layers down in the call stack can accidentally or intentionally impact the behavior
   of ostensibly unrelated parts of the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To communicate between their back-end Python servers and Javascript clients, IDOM's

<p>The most striking feature of the engineering quad of my <em>alma mater</em>, Rice University, are the three massive slabs of granite erected on large plinths at its center, each canted at a different angle: 45, 90, and 180 degrees. Less remarked upon, but more significant to my young, impressionable, and romantic mind, was another sculpture, entitled “Energy,” tucked off on the north side of the quad, against the façade of the Abercrombie Laboratory. It depicts, in relief, a biblical figure clad in a loincloth and sporting a majestic beard, pulling beams of light from the sun with his left hand and casting them down to earth with his right – the apotheosis of the engineer. For indeed, virtually all of the energy used by human civilization derives from the sun, in some fashion or another,<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> a revelation which struck me with great force as an undergraduate.</p>



<p>In the eighteenth century, the predominant source of non-animal energy in European society came from falling water – water that had been lifted into the clouds by the warmth of the sun before descending as rain.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Watermills were known and used across Eurasia from ancient times – the earliest evidence comes from the third century BCE. At the height of the Roman Empire, engineers developed the technology on a gargantuan scale, as evidenced by the ruins of the Barbegal mill complex in southern France, which consisted of sixteen wheels running in pairs down a steep hillside, all supplied by a large stone aqueduct. However, there is no evidence for widespread use of the waterwheel prior to the middle ages, when they multiplied across the streams of Western Europe by the thousands. The Domesday Book, for example, an eleventh-century royal census of England and Wales, counted over 5,000 mills in the territories claimed by William the Conqueror.</p>



<p>The endless rotation of the wheel was most often applied to the grinding of grain, but mills for the fulling of woolen cloth were also common – they beat the fibers into a firm felt with wooden triphammers controlled by a camshaft. By the later middle ages, however, inventive craftsmen had applied the watermill to nearly every industrial task imaginable, as historian Lynn White, Jr. cataloged:</p>



<blockquote><p>…mills for tanning or laundering, mills for sawing, for crushing anything from olives to ore, mills for operating the bellows of blast furnaces, the hammers of the forge, or the grindstones to finish and polish weapons and armors, mills for reducing pigments for paint or pulp for paper or the mash for beer, were increasingly to be found all over Europe.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p></blockquote>



<p>As long as the rains fell and the waters flowed, these machines carried out tasks that in previous ages would have been possible only at the cost of sore muscles, aching joints, and dripping sweat – whether human or animal.</p>



<p>Millwrights developed a variety of techniques over the centuries to adapt the wheel to different circumstances. The vertical “undershot” wheel, with water directed against the bottom of the wheel, served well on streams with a shallow grade but a high flow of water. The “overshot” wheel, on the other hand, which brought water to the top of the wheel where it filled buckets attached to its circumference, worked better for steep, low-volume streams. A trickle too feeble to push an undershot wheel could still fill buckets, if more slowly, and the steep grade made it easier to bring the water to the top of the wheel (although some sort of wooden flume was required to complete the millrace, which, along with the buckets, made the overshot wheel a more complex design). Horizontal wheels, on the other hand, though relatively inefficient, allowed for very simple mill construction. A horizontal wheel under a flour mill built atop the millrace could turn the grinding stone directly, without the need for a lantern gear to translate a vertical rotation into a horizontal one.</p>



<p>Yet for all the variety of its applications, the supply of water power was strictly limited. One could dam mill ponds to even out the flow of water and cut races to bring water directly to the wheel, but a given watercourse could provide a reliable supply of power to only so many mills. Along the Vienne in southwestern France, mills crowded together as densely as twenty per kilometer of water. The congestion of the streams of the Rhine region with waterwheels was likely responsible for the terminal decline of the Atlantic salmon fisheries in those waterways in the later middle ages.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> As streams reached the saturation point, conflict over control of the water between upstream and downstream millers inevitably ensued. Many important precedents in property law revolved around such disputes. In 1600, for example, in a case came before the King’s Bench in England, the plaintiff had torn down a pair of decrepit fulling mills to replace them with mills to grind grain. In the interval, the defendant rerouted the water supply to his own upstream mills, claiming that the plaintiff had sacrificed his ancient rights to the water (from “time whereof memory”) by tearing down the original mills. The court ruled in favor the plaintiff – concluding that the destruction of the mills themselves did not destroy his right to the watercourse.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>



<p>Humans had tapped another potent source of energy, of course, since time immemorial – that of fire. Unlike water power, fire could produce heat to warm homes and smelt ores, but could not drive any kind of mechanical process. Wood historically provided most of the fuel supply for both domestic and industrial heating, sometimes supplemented by peat. But Britain stood out for its increasing exploitation of coal from the sixteenth century onward. By 1700, Britons were digging up nearly 3 million tons of it each year, over thirteen times as much as in 1560, although the population of the island as a whole had not even doubled in that time period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the course of the eighteenth century, inventors discovered that, when combined, these two elemental forces of fire and water could turn cheap, energy-dense coal into mechanical energy freed from the shackles of topography. Their creation, the steam engine, would transform the world. The industrial revolution — and all it brought in its train, from cheap clothing to regimented factory labor — began under water power but accelerated under a head of steam. Travel, war, and empire would never be the same after the creation of the railroad and the steamship.</p>



<p>Electrical power, too, was a product of steam. Edison set out to “subdivide the light,” scaling down the overpowering glow of electric arc lighting into something that could be used inside the home. But the even more profound long-term effect of the spread of electrical lighting systems was the ability to subdivide the power of a steam engine, and deliver it wherever, and in whatever quantity, one might desire. Steam removed the constraints that tied machinery to a nearby water source; electric power removed the need for any mechanical connection at all between a source of power and its point of use.</p>



<p>Steam power had knock on affects in other areas of technology and science, as well. Throughout the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the heyday of steam, the development of steam engines simultaneously benefited from and stimulated improvements in metallurgy and the science of heat.</p>



<p>This series will survey the history of this “age of steam”, an age that continues, in attenuated form, up to the present day. For despite the predominance of petroleum-based fuels in transportation over the last century, and the increasing pressure in recent decades to shift to steam-free sources of energy like solar and wind, much of our electricity still comes from heating water to make steam. This subject matter marks a departure for this blog, which heretofore has focused on the history of computing and communications technologies. Moreover, there is no shortage of popular accounts of the early history of the steam engine, including the recent <em>Energy </em>by Richard Rhodes and <em>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</em> by William Rosen. However, I believe this series will bring some fresh perspective on the story, especially by extending it into the twentieth century, unlike the many accounts that leave off as soon as the locomotive became a viable means of transport, around 1830.</p>



<p>Evidence for experiments and devices that turned steam into motion date back to the first century BCE, But Not until the philosophers of the seventeenth century developed a science of pressure were inventors able to create the first engines that could drive machinery by steam. We will begin this series in earnest next time by examining the emergence of this science, whose most important result was the revelation that the air itself has weight.</p>

<p>We have used a test-driven approach to write all new pieces of functionality throughout the book.<br>
While this strategy has served us well, we have not invested a lot of time into <em>refactoring</em> our test code. As a result, our <code>tests</code> folder is a bit of mess at this point.<br>
Before moving forward, we will restructure our integration test suite to support us as our application grows in complexity and the number of tests increases.</p>

<p>Is writing tests a good use of developers' time?</p>
<p>A good test suite is, first and foremost, a risk-mitigation measure.<br>
Automated tests reduce the risk associated with changes to an existing codebase - most regressions and bugs are caught in the continuous integration pipeline and never reach users. The team is therefore empowered to iterate faster and release more often.</p>
<p>Tests act as documentation as well.<br>
The test suite is often the best starting point when deep-diving in an unknown code base - it shows you how the code is supposed to behave and what scenarios are considered relevant enough to have dedicated tests for.</p>
<p>"Write a test suite!" should definitely be on your to-do list if you want to make your project more welcoming to new contributors.</p>
<p>There are other positive side-effects often associated with good tests - modularity, decoupling. These are harder to quantify, as we have yet to agree as an industry on what "good code" looks like.</p>

<p>Although there are compelling reasons to invest time and effort in writing a good test suite, reality is somewhat messier.</p>
<p>First, the development community did not always believe in the value of testing.<br>
We can find examples of test-driven development throughout the history of the discipline, but it is only with the "Extreme Programming" (XP) book that the practice entered the mainstream debate - in 1999!</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts do not happen overnight - it took years for the test-driven approach to gain traction as a "best practice" within the industry.</p>
<p>If test-driven development has won the minds and hearts of developers, the battle with management is often still undergoing.<br>
Good tests build technical leverage, but writing tests takes time. When a deadline is pressing, testing is often the first to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>As a consequence, most of the material you find around is either an introduction to testing or a guide on how to pitch its value to stakeholders.<br>
There is very little about testing <em>at scale</em> - what happens if you stick to the book and keep writing tests as the codebase grows to tens of thousands of lines, with hundreds of test cases?</p>

<p>All test suites start in the same way: an empty file, a world of possibilities.<br>
You go in, you add the first test. Easy, done.<br>
Then the second. Boom.<br>
The third. You just had to copy a few lines from the first, all good.<br>
The fourth...</p>
<p>After a while, test coverage starts to go down: new code is less thoroughly tested than the code you wrote at the very beginning of the project. Have you started to doubt the value of tests?<br>
Absolutely not, tests are great!<br>
Yet, you are writing fewer tests as the project moves forward.<br>
It's because of friction - it got progressively more cumbersome to write new tests as the codebase evolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test code is still code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has to be modular, well-structured, sufficiently documented. It requires maintenance.<br>
If we do not actively invest in the health of our test suite, it will rot over time.<br>
Coverage goes down and soon enough we will find critical paths in our application code that are never exercised by automated tests.</p>
<p>You need to regularly step back to take a look at your test suite <em>as a whole</em>.<br>
Time to look at ours, isn't it?</p>

<p>All our integration tests live within a single file, <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]

// Ensure that the `tracing` stack is only initialised once using `lazy_static`
</span><span>lazy_static::lazy_static! {
    </span><span>static ref </span><span>TRACING</span><span>: () = {
        </span><span>let</span><span> filter = </span><span>if </span><span>std::env::var("</span><span>TEST_LOG</span><span>").</span><span>is_ok</span><span>() { "</span><span>debug</span><span>" } </span><span>else </span><span>{ "" };
        </span><span>let</span><span> subscriber = </span><span>get_subscriber</span><span>("</span><span>test</span><span>".</span><span>into</span><span>(), filter.</span><span>into</span><span>());
        </span><span>init_subscriber</span><span>(subscriber);
    };
}

</span><span>pub struct </span><span>TestApp {
    </span><span>pub </span><span>address</span><span>: String,
    </span><span>pub </span><span>db_pool</span><span>: PgPool,
}

async </span><span>fn </span><span>spawn_app</span><span>() -&gt; TestApp {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

</span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>configure_database</span><span>(</span><span>config</span><span>: &amp;DatabaseSettings) -&gt; PgPool {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>health_check_works</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_200_for_valid_form_data</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>actix_rt</span><span>::</span><span>test</span><span>]
async </span><span>fn </span><span>subscribe_returns_a_400_when_fields_are_present_but_invalid</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// [...]
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is only one test dealing with our health check endpoint - <code>health_check_works</code>.<br>
The other three tests are probing our <code>POST /subscriptions</code> endpoint while the rest of the code deals with shared setup steps (<code>spawn_app</code>, <code>TestApp</code>, <code>configure_database</code>, <code>TRACING</code>).</p>
<p>Why have we shoved everything in <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>?<br>
Because it was convenient!<br>
The setup functions were already there - it was easier to add another test case within the same file than figuring out how to share that code properly across multiple test modules.</p>
<p>Our main goal in this refactoring is <em>discoverability</em>: </p>
<ul>
<li>given an application endpoint, it should be easy to find the corresponding integration tests within the <code>tests</code> folder;</li>
<li>when writing a test, it should be easy to find the relevant test helper functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on folder structure, but that  is definitely not the only tool available when it comes to test discovery.<br>
Test coverage tools can often tell you which tests triggered the execution of a certain line of application code.<br>
You can rely on techniques such as <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/coverage-marks/">coverage marks</a> to create an obvious link between test and application code.</p>
<p>As always, a multi-pronged approach is likely to give you the best results as the complexity of your test suite increases.</p>

<p>Before we start moving things around, let's nail down a few facts about integration testing in Rust.<br>
The <code>tests</code> folder is somewhat special - <code>cargo</code> knows to look into it searching for integration tests.</p>
<p>Each file within the <code>tests</code> folder gets compiled as its own crate.<br>
We can check this out by running <code>cargo build --tests</code> and then looking under <code>target/debug/deps</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Build test code, without running tests 
</span><span>cargo</span><span> build</span><span> --tests
</span><span># Find all files with a name starting with `health_check` 
</span><span>ls</span><span> target/debug/deps | </span><span>grep</span><span> health_check
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>health_check-fc23645bf877da35
health_check-fc23645bf877da35.d
</span></code></pre>
<p>The trailing hashes will likely be different on your machine, but there should be two entries starting with <code>health_check-*</code>.<br>
What happens if you try to run it? </p>
<pre><code><span>./target/debug/deps/health_check-fc23645bf877da35
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>running</span><span> 4 tests
</span><span>test</span><span> health_check_works ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_fields_are_present_but_invalid ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_200_for_valid_form_data ... ok

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 4 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.44s
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's right, it runs our integration tests!<br>
If we had five <code>*.rs</code> files under <code>tests</code>, we'd find five executables in <code>target/debug/deps</code>.</p>

<p>If each integration test file is its own executable, how do we share test helpers functions?</p>
<p>The first option is to define a stand-alone module - e.g. <code>tests/helpers/mod.rs</code><sup><a href="#test-common-folder">1</a></sup>.<br>
You can add common functions in <code>mod.rs</code> (or define other sub-modules in there) and then refer to <code>helpers</code> in your test file (e.g. <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>) with:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]
</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>helpers</code> is bundled in the <code>health_check</code> test executable as a sub-module and we get access to the functions it exposes in our test cases.<br>
This approach works fairly well to start out, but it leads to annoying <code>function is never used</code> warnings down the line.<br>
The issue is that <code>helpers</code> is bundled as a sub-module, it is not invoked as a third-party crate: <code>cargo</code> compiles each test executable in isolation and warns us if, for a specific test file, one or more public functions in <code>helpers</code> have never been invoked. This is bound to happen as your test suite grows - not all test files will use <em>all</em> your helper methods.</p>
<p>The second option takes full advantage of that each file under <code>tests</code> is its own executable - we can create sub-modules <em>scoped to a single test executable</em>!<br>
Let's create an <code>api</code> folder under <code>tests</code>, with a single <code>main.rs</code> file inside:</p>
<pre><code><span>tests/
  api/
    main.rs
  health_check.rs
</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we gain clarity: we are structuring <code>api</code> in the very same way we would structure a binary crate. Less magic - it builds on the same knowledge of the module system you built while working on application code.<br>
If you run <code>cargo build --tests</code> you should be able to spot</p>
<pre><code><span>Running</span><span> target/debug/deps/api-0a1bfb817843fdcf

</span><span>running</span><span> 0 tests

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 0 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.00s
</span></code></pre>
<p>in the output - <code>cargo</code> compiled <code>api</code> as a test executable, looking for tests cases.<br>
There is no need to define a <code>main</code> function in <code>main.rs</code> - the Rust test framework adds one for us behind the scenes<sup><a href="#custom-test-framework">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We can now add sub-modules in <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/main.rs

</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;
</span><span>mod </span><span>health_check;
</span><span>mod </span><span>subscriptions;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Add three empty files - <code>tests/api/helpers.rs</code>, <code>tests/api/health_check.rs</code> and <code>tests/api/subscriptions.rs</code>.<br>
Time to delete <code>tests/health_check.rs</code> and re-distribute its content:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/helpers.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::{Connection, Executor, PgConnection, PgPool};
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::configuration::{get_configuration, DatabaseSettings};
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::e…</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The idea</h3><p><strong>Stompenberg.</strong> Sounds like a brand of Swedish outdoor clothing, but also like a villain in the next James Bond film – but in this case it’s actually a mash-up of two things. Stompenberg is the hybrid of <strong>“stomp boxes”</strong> and <strong>“Heisenberg”,</strong> which made the impossible possible after a long time of <strong>screwing</strong> and <strong>soldering.</strong>&nbsp;It’s a Thomann <strong>online app</strong> that allows musicians to<strong> test out real effect pedals</strong> with their own equipment, either <strong>from home</strong> or <strong>on the go</strong>. Below you will get a brief idea of the concept, development and implementation and of what <strong>Stompenberg</strong>&nbsp;is capable of… 💥🎶</p><hr><h3>Growing pains</h3><h4><strong>Planning&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The <a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>selected pedals</strong></a> travel to the<strong> Thomann partner laboratory</strong> in <strong>Erlangen, Germany</strong> where they undergo some <strong>operations</strong> and <b>transformations&nbsp;</b>by our men in white with the <strong>license to solder.</strong></p><p>The following happens: A pedal is first deprived of its <strong>shell</strong>, <strong>pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong> The pots are measured to see what they do (whether they are <strong>linear, logarithmic,</strong> etc.) and replaced with <strong>digital pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong></p><p>Then, for reasons of shielding, the original <strong>housing</strong> is put back on. Everything is recognisable as a pedal again, but now, instead of pots and switches, <strong>ribbon cables</strong> hang from the orphaned holes.</p><h4><strong>The construction</strong></h4><p>This ever-growing Frankenstein is mounted on a <strong>rack drawer,</strong> which houses not only the <strong>power supply</strong> but also a <strong>mini-computer</strong> specially developed for this purpose, per pedal.</p><p><strong>Ribbon cable</strong> runs to the computer, audio cable into the pedal, everything is beautifully adjusted and balanced and then off to the rack!</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1-300x200.jpg"></p><hr><h3>Connection to the shop</h3><h4><strong>The longest guitar cable in the world…</strong></h4><p>… is available from <strong>Thomann</strong> in the <strong>shop,</strong> but not from <strong><a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html">Stompenberg</a>.</strong> From now on the <strong>soldering iron</strong> gets put away and is replaced by a <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>keyboard</strong> in Thomann’s Treppendorf. This is where our <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> sit, brooding over the visualization of the pedals and the interface that allows the pedals to be operated from anywhere in the world. From the logo to the controls to each button, everything comes from Thomann’s teamwork.</p><p>When you turn the <strong>virtual knob</strong> at home, the <strong>digital knob</strong> on the pedal in the Thomann lab is adjusted via this interface, while your sound runs through exactly this pedal and comes back to you with effect. There are<strong> 3</strong> <strong>modes</strong> and a lot of <strong>UI tricks</strong> to discover.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lava-150x150.jpg" width="275">&nbsp; <img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6-1024x682.jpg" width="412"></p><hr><h2><strong>The Interface</strong></h2><h4><strong>The effect device</strong></h4><p>Design and development flow together here with loving attention to detail: Every <strong>knob</strong> can be rotated, every <strong>footswitch</strong> can be stepped on and every <strong>lever</strong> is slidable. This replica <strong>behaves exactly like the real pedal</strong> in the lab, right down to the smallest <strong>LED,</strong> and can therefore be operated in exactly the same way.</p><h4><strong>The three modes: PLAY, REC &amp; LIVE</strong></h4><p><strong>PLAY:</strong> You feed <strong>pre-recorded samples</strong> or specially <strong>uploaded sounds</strong> through the pedals and operate the controls with <strong>both hands</strong> (if using a <strong>touchscreen)</strong> while the sound loops through the effect pedal.</p><p><strong>REC:</strong> If you want to go a step beyond, you can <strong>record your own riffs</strong> and loop them through the pedal of your choice!</p><p><strong>LIVE:</strong> The ultimate experience – here you <strong>play live</strong> and get the result back directly from the Thomann lab. So you can try out the pedal, live, from the comfort of your bedroom, with just a small <strong>latency,</strong> but that’s not bad considering the signal travels virtually at the speed of light&nbsp;through the<strong> whole of Germany or even the whole of Europe.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The bright side: Even if your pedal is busy and you end up in the waiting queue, you don’t have to listen to the dude in front of you butchering a cover of Stairway To Heaven 😉</p><h4><strong>And the rest of my equipment?</strong></h4><p>If you want to know exactly how the distortion in front of your own amp is done, you might need a <strong>reamping box.</strong> But under certain circumstances the line output of the interface does the trick too, just turned down low. The result reads like a poem:</p><p>You play your own guitar</p><p>through a real pedal (which is somewhere else)</p><p>through your amp</p><p>through your cabinet or speakers</p><p>at the volume you want</p><p>and you can turn, shift and control all the knobs as you like.</p><p>… and get a pretty accurate picture if this pedal will be your new one or if you prefer another one (which you tested with Stompenberg). No need to drive to Treppendorf, to send cardboard boxes back to Thomann halfway around the world, or to listen to annoying comments from the people waiting in line.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="626" srcset="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg 1400w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-565x253.jpg 565w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-215x96.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></p><hr><h3><strong>The Future</strong></h3><p>The conversion is in full swing and while <strong>Stompenberg</strong> is running, our partners in <strong>Erlangen</strong> are taking more pedals apart every day to make them digitally accessible.

<![CDATA[It's Not an Attention Economy. It's Attention Stewardship]]>

<p>
Some people saw the thrashing idscape in which we tribulate coming from a long way off. And they called it “the attention economy.”
</p>
<p>
A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/michael-goldhaber-internet.html" target="_blank">New York Times opinion column by Charlie Warzel</a> reminded me that as easy as it has been to trace some of the more dangerous effects of the attention economy to events of the last decade, some people could tell where things were headed long, long before that. One of them was Michael Goldhaber, a theoretical physicist and, as Warzel grandly introduces him, “the internet prophet you’ve never heard of.” Well, he had me at <i>internet</i>. And <i>prophet</i>. And <i>never heard of</i>.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber has been writing about the attention economy for decades. In fact, back in 1997, he wrote an <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/12/es-attention/" target="_blank">essay for <span>WIRED</span></a> about how the transactions of our dollars-and-cents economy would not only begin to include exchanges of attention, but would eventually be replaced entirely by them. For a population just getting to know the internet, the idea that attention would matter more than money was preposterous. For us who now know it well, it’s remarkably on-point.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, it’s fascinating — and more than a little bit concerning — to note that Goldhaber’s own pessimism was far more accurate than his optimism. He earnestly predicted that attention would replace money because “attention can’t be bought.” Well, it turns out that it very much can. And as utopic as a moneyless future sounds, a future in which attention replaces money as our currency seems obviously worse when you consider what Goldhaber got <i>right</i>. He warned that the pressure individuals would feel to both attract and give attention would metastasize into a wide-spreading erosion of culture. Goldhaber believed that simple human psychology predicted this. He wrote, “Our abilities to pay attention are limited. Not so our abilities to receive it. The value of true modesty or humility is hard to sustain in an attention economy.” In a recent conversation in preparation for Charlie Warzel’s op-ed, Goldhaber echoed the same point: “When you have attention, you have power, and some people will try and succeed in getting huge amounts of attention, and they would not use it in equal or positive ways.”
</p>
<p>
We’ve all lived and suffered that truth, especially acutely over the last few years, haven’t we? Warzel sums it up this way, “Attention is a bit like the air we breathe. And it feels as if our attention has become polluted.”
</p>
<p>
Warzel connects Goldhaber’s early warnings to their latest effects, including the attempted insurrection on January 6th. The mob may have been after many different things, but the one thing every participant seems to have had in common was a desire for attention. The event itself, he writes, was “the result of thousands of influencers and news outlets that, in an attempt to gain fortune and fame and attention, trotted out increasingly dangerous conspiracy theories on platforms optimized to amplify outrage.” Implied here is something I’d been observing as an increasingly rapid contagion of anti-truth since the day Donald Trump descended his escalator to declare his intention to destroy the country: that conspiracies and accusations of conspiracy are <i>products</i>, not byproducts of the attention economy. They’re not something to believe in, but merely material to exchange for attention. In an inversion of assumptions about meaning, it’s no longer relevant whether a person <i>believes</i> what they are saying as long as it is understood <i>why</i> they are saying it. Lies can be quite expedient.
</p>
<p>
That the attention economy is oversupplied with bile and bullshit is a compound problem. It’s obvious that the effects of peddling and buying lies can be profound. People can lose their grips on reality. Systems upon which many rely can fall apart. The equity of hundreds of years of history can dry up in a moment. These are the agonies of our public reckoning with how technology, truth, and treason have mixed and mingled in recent years. But we may get past this very shared and public struggle with truth and technology and still suffer the erosion of culture that Goldhaber warned about. Culture, after all, is bigger than political partisanship, bigger than sovereign nations, bigger than infrastructure, bigger than multinational corporations. Culture is a tapestry of ideas, beliefs, and agreements. And as powerful as any idea or belief or agreement may be, each relies upon attention.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber also wrote, “When you pay attention to one thing, you ignore something else.” That is such a simple statement, but it’s no less profound. It explains why thousands of articles go unread as you read this one — simple, indeed — but also why the aggregate of billions of equally simple exchanges of attention lead to the grand murmurations of culture.
</p>
<p>
If attention is an economy, then, in theory, it should follow a simple law of supply and demand just like any other economic system. In other words, the value and supply of attention should settle at a point where the there’s enough attention to meet demand. The problem is that while such a balance can be expected of bars of gold or even shares of a videogame retailer’s stock, attention works by its own rules that upend the law of supply and demand. There will never be enough attention to meet demand.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber puts it this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
“The attention economy is a zero-sum game. What one person gets, someone else is denied. The size of the attention pie can grow as more and more people join the world audience, but the size of the average slice can’t. Real attention to you, meaning minds focusing on you, is always limited by the number of minds there are. The more minds, the more attention - but also the more who might want attention. The total available attention per capita (per mind) is simply not going to change.”
</blockquote>
<p>
These very words that I have written and that you are now reading provide a good example of what Goldhaber is talking about. You’re reading this. That’s good for me. But that also means there are billions of things you’re <i>not</i> reading. That’s not good for the people who wrote them and whatever attention they hoped to get from you. Meanwhile, every moment that you spend paying attention to me is not only a moment you’re not paying attention to someone else, it’s a moment you’re not spending doing something that could get you attention. That’s where the law of supply and demand breaks down. Attention can’t be stored up or mass produced; it’s an inherently temporal matter. The more attention we pay, the less we can get.
</p>
<p>
But what if you don’t care about getting attention? This is a question that should be asked. It’s easy enough to say that the internet, and specifically things like social media, have trained us to desire and seek attention more and more rapidly than we did before. I’m willing to accept that as true. But I don’t think we can say that every one of us has been affected in the same way, or that the desire for attention has increased equally across all of humanity, or that the form attention takes and the means by which we seek it is a singular thing. Of course it is not. Though there are people willing to do all kinds of things simply for attention, not all of us go to such lengths. But even so, we do seek attention and we do pay it out. Our transactions may be much more mundane than a streamed coup, but they exist nonetheless and they are a finite resource.
</p>
<p>
That makes me wonder whether, through the frame of the attention economy, we are seeing its mechanics all wrong.
</p>
<p>
In the zero-sum attention game, the reader, you, gives the writer, me, your attention. You only get what I have written, for as long as you’re reading it. But by these terms, I stand to get “more.” There could be thousands of you reading this at the same time. Though I can’t store your attention on the shelf, I can still get more than I pay out. If I’m a good writer, I “win” the game. Is that really the best way to think of this? After all, surely you stand to gain something, too. In the zero sum attention game, I am the beneficiary of your attention. But what if we chose to reverse that? What if we chose to see the beneficiary of the attention economy not as the recipient, but as the one paying attention?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, then, we might think differently about information. We might begin to care more about its <i>value</i> than its volume.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard" target="_blank">René Girard</a> was a widely influential thinker who certainly would have agreed. Girard is probably most famous for his thinking about the nature of human desire. He proposed that it’s not a singular phenomenon, but an aggregate effect. His <i>mimetic theory</i> suggests that what you and I want is not original, but derives from what others want — that desire is an imitation. <i>Mimesis</i> is mimicry.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this is a fiercely debated point. Even right now, you may be thinking of half a dozen things that you’ve chosen for your own reasons, perhaps even at the resistance of others. That something as obviously personal as desire is really just the imitation of someone else’s desire seems, on its face, to be absurd. Is your favorite breakfast cereal really the end of an infinite regress of desires, and if so, originating with whom? That I can’t answer. Perhaps there’s a Girard scholar out there who can.
</p>
<p>
But the more interesting thing about Girard’s theories is the broader idea that, as this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePortal/comments/cfmtq2/peter_thiel_during_the_portal_about_the_book/euiv3op/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank">incredibly robust Reddit explanation</a> puts it, “secrets may exist in far more abundance than we realize <span>AND</span> YET…There are reasons we don’t see them. And those reasons involve the details, mechanics and implications of Girard’s theories. How we focus our desire and our attention is less under our control than we realize.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the question of origin in Girard’s theory of desire, the mechanics of how desire and attention work together to influence people are obvious. This is why fortunes can be created within hours of a photograph of a celebrity wearing something interesting being published online. …</p></div></div>

      <p>Next week the venerable British auction house Christie’s will set a precedent: It’s conducting the first ever auction of a digital artwork. And just to spice things up, there’s a crypto component to it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The groundbreaking Christie’s auction will feature the work of an artist calling himself </span><a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/"><span>Beeple</span></a><span>. The artwork being sold is a massive digital collage of five thousand pieces of work Beeple has released on the internet daily over 5,000 days.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That art is delivered in the form of a plain old JPG, of the sort that you might encounter on any website. The crypto twist is that a unique digital token on the Ethereum blockchain (</span><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756#code"><span>you can see the code here</span></a><span>) was “minted”&nbsp;by the artist, connecting it to the JPG file. To be precise, a </span><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"><span>cryptographic hash</span></a><span> of the image is embedded in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s sort of like painters of yore signing a canvas, except this takes place cryptographically, and on a blockchain. These are called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Christie’s auction is eagerly awaited. The auction house had earlier dabbled in crypto art with the October 2020 sale of a physical installation linked to an NFT called “Block 21”. That piece </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-blockchain-technology-reached-christie-s-changed-art-world-along-n1244951"><span>fetched $130,000</span></a><span> or almost 11 times its low estimate. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But the upcoming Beeple auction could bring in much more. Beeple </span><a href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/beeple-on-how-and-why-he-raked-in-3-5-million/"><span>earlier sold $3.5 million worth</span></a><span> of digital tokens in a single weekend in December, a landmark amount in the burgeoning field of crypto art. These sales happened on crypto focused marketplaces, so the Christie’s event is expected to expose the artist to a whole new crowd, as </span><a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/christies-beeple-blockchain-art-sale-1234583847/"><span>Art News has reported</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Indeed, Christie’s alludes to this in its prospectus accompanying the auction. The earlier sales make putting a price estimate on the upcoming event “impossible to predict,” the auction-house says. “Your guess is as good as ours,” said Noah Davis, the Christie’s specialist overseeing the sale, in the prospectus. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here Come the Tech Moguls</h2>
<p><span>Christie’s isn’t alone in recognizing the potential —&nbsp;and chasing the returns —&nbsp;on crypto collectibles. Tech moguls appear to be enthusiastic about the trend. Mark Cuban kicked it all off at the end of January when he wrote a blog post praising “the store of value generation,”&nbsp;</span><span>a new cohort of people who understood that digital objects on a blockchain could hold their value just as well as a fine art painting, vintage car or rare baseball collection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This generation knows that a smart contract and the digital good it reflects … are a better investment than old school see, touch or feel uses,” the </span><a href="https://blogmaverick.com/2021/01/31/the-store-of-value-generation-is-kicking-your-ass-and-you-dont-even-know-it/'"><span>Shark Tank star wrote</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Cuban’s fellow tech elites have followed his lead. The billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya </span><span>told Bloomberg</span><span> a few days ago that he has been building a “fairly sizeable” collection of digital art and other NFTs. “These may sound crazy to some, but I do think that that’s the next frontier of digital currency and digital assets,” he said. Palihapitiya is a long-time Bitcoin bull, and rumored sightings of the crypto whale had trickled through the Ether for weeks. “</span><span>Is that you, @Chamath?</span><span>” became a punch-line in NFT circles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, the wine entrepreneur turned tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCFastMoney/status/1362192935937323011?s=20"><span>took to CNBC</span></a><span> to extol the virtues of NFTs and other alternative investments, including trading cards. He had been steadily increasing mentions of crypto tokens on his Twitter feed, where he talks to 2.2 million followers, over the last week (he also started following me, for some reason!). Here he is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/1361886864538562568?s=20"><span>on Wednesday</span></a><span>: “My current situation - I’m trying to trade cases of Chateau D'Yquem for #NFT. 2021 life, lol”</span></p>
<p><span>The tech millionaires and Christie’s are on to something. According to the </span><a href="https://cryptoart.io/data"><span>data site CryptoArt.io</span></a><span>, the value of all crypto art that changed hands in January was nearly $12 million. Twelve months ago, that figure stood at $160,000, representing growth of over 100 times over 12 months. February’s volumes have already topped January’s, and we’re only 18 days in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A report from data site NonFungible.com and L’Atelier, a unit of the French bank BNP Paribas </span><a href="https://nonfungible.com/blog/nft-yearly-report-2020"><span>released this week</span></a><span> says that crypto art now represents 24% of the entire NFT marketplace by value, accounting for the biggest ticket sales. The art segment lags only NFTs associated with “metaverses” or virtual worlds where users can buy pieces of land, outfits and other items that are secured by a blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The dark side of crypto art</span></h2>
<p><span>As investors pile in to crypto art, and artists make millions from their sale, surely the utopian vision of a blockchain cutting out intermediaries and rewarding creators has been realized? Maybe not, as it turns out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beatriz Helena Ramos is the founder of a pioneering crypto art platform called </span><a href="https://dada.art/"><span>Dada</span></a><span>. An artist herself, she has worked on everything from editorial illustrations for the New York Times to animations for Disney and MTV. To hear Ramos tell it, the surging crypto art market has become successful—at the wrong thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“What’s happening in the space is that the technology is very innovative, yet all of the social layer and the economic layer is just a repetition of everything from the legacy, default, world,” she says. “What we see with NFTs is that it’s producing the exact same outcomes that we were trying to disrupt.”</p>
<p>What are those outcomes, exactly? Ramos says the market remains tilted in favor of investors, and the vast majority of artists aren’t going to sell their work for millions the way Beeple has. Instead, they will toil in the long tail of art, replicating the star system of the current art market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A </span><a href="https://powerdada.medium.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-secondary-markets-886d5c929efa"><span>study by Massimo Franceschet</span></a><span>, a computer scientist at the University of Udine, on the largest crypto art platform Superrare shows that the crypto art market has more wealth disparity among artists than any country in the history of the world. Some 80% of sales go to the top 25% of artists. While artists on Superrare at present earn the lion’s share of sales volume, but as artworks get resold on secondary markets, Franceschet expects collectors to start earning more than artists by next June.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ramos says she sees the human side of these statistics often. “We see the casualties coming to us all the time. Tons of people who leave the space because they never sold anything, because they have to shill, because collectors actually harass artists on these chats and Discord channels. We’ve heard some horror stories, and there’s no accountability for anything,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While blockchains hold out the possibility of tokenizing anything, they also quickly run into the limits of this reductive logic. As Ramos says, turning everything into a market leads to “perverse” incentives, like an artists’s work rising after her death, ensuring the supply of work is limited. “Markets can’t account for anything that isn’t quantitative,” she tells me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the lure of a blockchain’s ability to shift paradigms holds Ramos in its sway. She and a community of artists and technologists at Dada are working on a system that they believe will create fairer outcomes for artists and participants. They are focused on the social implications, and how the system might be governed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You can have huge networks with network effects, coordinating people with each other and creating things. You don’t need structures like companies and things like that,” she says. <span>“</span>Imagine the quality and broad value that can be created. All you have to do is coordinate them. And so blockchain comes again.”</p>

<p>It hasn’t been a quiet few weeks on Twitter in India. The country’s capital city has seen over four months of protest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government enacted agricultural laws that would adversely affect farmers across India. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55899754">The farmer protests</a>, as the movement has come to be known, has taken to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to make the cause heard globally — and it’s worked. Earlier this month, celebrities like <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-under-fire-for-tweeting-about-indian-farmers-toolkit/a-56458306">Greta Thunberg</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">Rihanna</a> weighed in with their tweets of support. Backlash <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">soon followed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the government’s ire against global critics of Modi’s Hindu nationalist party has turned to Twitter itself. Citing threats to public order, on February 1, Indian authorities <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics">appeared to have requested Twitter to suspend or remove</a> dozens of accounts on its platform. Twitter briefly complied but, after public outcry, reinstated the accounts and then <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/twitter-stands-up-to-india-and-refuses-to-block-journalists.php">refused to remove</a> hundreds more.</p>



<p>It’s in the middle of this battle that Aprameya Radhakrishna’s 10-month-old social media platform was thrust into the spotlight. Soft-spoken and studious, Radhakrishna is a serial entrepreneur: in 2015, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/taxiforsure-founder-aprameya-radhakrishnas-life-after-sell-off/articleshow/48078627.cms">he sold his first company</a>, a ride-sharing app called TaxiForSure, to local giant Ola for $200 million. His latest venture is an app called Koo, <a href="https://www.kooapp.com/">a microblogging platform similar to Twitter</a> but for local-language speakers in India, a country with more than 20 languages and over 700 dialects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After weeks of battling with Twitter, some of India’s most prominent Hindu nationalist politicians took to their social accounts and instructed their followers to leave Western social networks for Koo, a local, free-speech platform. “I am now on Koo,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1359058583934013442">tweeted</a> India’s minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal. “Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates.” Many of his <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal">9.6 million followers</a> obliged. More right-wing politicians <a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1360067772571545606?s=20">followed suit</a>, as did some of <a href="https://twitter.com/KanganaTeam/status/1361421114220576768">Bollywood</a>’s biggest stars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overnight, the platform went from a relatively obscure app to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/koo-lines-up-indian-investors-as-popularity-surges/articleshow/80867206.cms">headline news</a> and bagged <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/microblogging-platform-koo-bags-4-1-million-in-funding/articleshow/80685024.cms">$4.1 million in series A funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radhakrishna and his platform are in a curious position. The founder insists he’s apolitical — he’s appeared in both <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/news/koo-app-everything-you-need-to-know-about-koo-the-indian-alternative-to-twitter-575160">left-leaning</a> and <a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/02/rahul-roushan-aprameya-radhakrishna-koo-co-founder-twitter-alternative-made-in-india-interview/">right-wing</a> outlets in the days since Koo has found the limelight — but is happily embracing the sudden rush to his app: Koo crossed <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/koo-sees-10-fold-increase-in-downloads-this-week-crosses-3-million-users-11613038170243.html">3 million users </a>this month, fueled in large part by Modi’s party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it’s unclear whether Koo will follow in the path of other social platforms <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/11/parler-mewe-gab-social-media-trump-election-facebook-twitter/6232351002/">that espouse “free speech” ideology</a>, it’s likely more Indian apps like Radhakrishna’s will follow. Prominent among Modi’s mantras for his vision of India is <em>Atmanirbhar Bharat: </em>a self-sufficient India. That vision <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indias-hashtag-war/">extends to the internet and social media</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months before prominent right-wing politicians began heralding his app as India’s Twitter, Radhakrishna and his team submitted Koo to a government <em>atmanirbhar </em>social media challenge, <a href="https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/business/business-news/koo-app-wins-pm-modi-aatm-nirbhar-app-innovation-challenge/articleshow/77432196.cms">and won</a>.</p>



<p>Radhakrishna spoke to <em>Rest Of World </em>over Google Meet from Bangalore. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Tell me a bit about how you came up with the idea for Koo.&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We started building it in November 2019 and launched it in March 2020. The idea behind it was that Twitter is existing in English in India, but the language speakers of India are not on Twitter. Let’s build a deeper experience for the language speakers. And because we built a deeper experience for the language speakers, we were able to make a very localized community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started with Kannada, then we did Hindi, then Telugu, Marathi, then Tamil: we launched all of these languages. Then, we started noticing Twitter was getting into trouble in the U.S. We said, Maybe we should just have English as well as the local languages, if ever Twitter gets into trouble or users want a separate option.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>When you started Koo, how soon were you approached by government officials who saw the </strong><a href="http://www.makeinindia.com/about"><strong>“Make in India”</strong></a><strong> potential for the app?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were a two-month-old app when we applied to the <a href="https://innovate.mygov.in/app-challenge/">[<em>Atmanibhar Bharat</em>]</a> challenge. We got into that challenge at the last minute, almost. Nobody approached us or anything. We applied just like any other startup — there were something like 7,000 social media startups that applied. We won that challenge, so that put us into the limelight: Oh, there’s an alternative microblogging platform that promotes local language<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4><strong>Walk me through how the last two or three weeks have been for you. Did you know that Piyush Goyal and the Ministry of Electronics and Technology would be encouraging their followers on Twitter to move to Koo en masse?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>No. It’s been totally surreal for us. It’s totally welcome at Koo. We as a company are benefiting from the love that users who are shifting [from Twitter] are showing us. We weren’t expecting it, but it’s a pleasant surprise. We’re happy this move is happening.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Were you prepared for the sudden influx of users on the back end?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. Scaling 10x suddenly, in a week, is a challenge for any company, especially a 10-month-old startup. But we’ve come through it; we are able to scale faster.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What were the user numbers like? Can you tell me how quickly they grew after the events of this month?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were very small, we were sub-100,000 DAU [daily active users]. Now we’re close to a million DAU. Close, not a million yet but close.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>By virtue of chance, or deliberate action, there’s an ideological framework under which Koo has been positioned. You don’t seem bothered by the fact that Koo is heralded </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>as the right-wing’s answer to Twitter</strong></a><strong>. Politics has played a role in the sudden attention that Koo has received. Have you considered the risks of embracing the way your app has been politicized?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It depends on the actions on the app. That first community [we built] in Kannada was built in a slower manner, and it has people from all parties in Karnataka.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we are seeing is that India wants to be more self-reliant. India includes everybody. Our app doesn’t understand “left” or “right.” <em>I </em>don’t understand “left” or “right.” I’m an entrepreneur; I’m extremely apolitical. And I’m all for the development of the country. If Koo as a statement can make us self-reliant on our own social networks and technology, then we should be cheering for it. We shouldn’t unnecessarily politicize it.</p>



<h4><strong>Social media is shaped by its users and early adopters. Most of Koo’s early video content partnerships with, say, Republic TV [a channel </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/23/indian-news-channel-fined-in-uk-for-hate-speech-about-pakistan"><strong>notorious for its allegiance</strong></a><strong> with the ruling Hindu nationalist party] or Mitron [a short-form video app that Modi supporters </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mitron-app-gives-tiktok-a-challenge-will-it-sustain-though"><strong>have embraced after the ban on TikTok</strong></a><strong>] have come to associate the app with a particular ideology. Are you worried Koo might get too polarized too quickly?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. In Karnataka, we have everybody [on Koo], as I said. As a business, we keep looking for partners to grow our business. Now, the partners who come aggressively and see the vision that we’re seeing as a free-expression platform and embrace the platform, we’re happy to welcome them. Why would I say no to somebody who wants to use our platform? Republic [TV] came first, that doesn’t mean I don’t want everybody else.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>In a recent BBC report about your app, there’s a rhetorical question, </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>“Is Koo India’s Parler?”</strong></a><strong> What do you make of that comparison?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Each platform comes into being for different reasons. I’ve already explained my story. We were doing this irrespective of whether Twitter existed, got banned, got into trouble, or flourished in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started in November 2019 because we said the voice of the Indian user who doesn’t speak English is not there. We are building an inclusive social media network for India. So what was your question?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>My question was what do you make of Parler and—</strong></h4>



<p>Parler came into existence because there was an anti-Trump thing, and they wanted to do a pro-Trump thing. We don’t exist because of some anti or pro thing. We are existing today irrespective of whether Twitter gets into trouble or not, irrespective of one ideology being there or not. We exist because we want to give a voice to every Indian. The purpose of our existence is very different from what a Parler is.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What do you make of the “Make in India” push, considering Facebook and Twitter have </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/technology/trump-facebook-twitter.html"><strong>an undeniable influence</strong></a><strong> in our current political discourse?</strong></h4>



<p>Every social media [platform] has to be responsible, to a certain extent, of what they bring into a country because it defines a lot of things in the country, like youth culture or how citizens of a country react to a situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-flower.svg" alt="Many parallel curve of an Euler spiral, resembling a flower"></p>

<p>Determining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_curve">parallel curves</a> is one of the basic 2D geometry operations. It has obvious applications in graphics, being the basis of creating a stroke outline from a path, but also in computer aided manufacturing (determining the path of a milling tool with finite radius) and path planning for robotics. There are plenty of solutions in the literature by now, but in this post I propose a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>A good survey paper is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Comparing-Offset-Curve-Approximation-Methods-Elber-Lee/9ac1978746ec54bdd555b906e2ea1eb922cd6ffd">Comparing Offset Curve Approximation Methods</a>. The main difference between these approaches is the choice of curve representation. An example of a curve representation highly specialized for deriving parallel curves is the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pythagorean-hodographs-Farouki-Sakkalis/e20aeb60de908061797b6eaf3af79fdc7e5acdd7">Pythagorean Hodograph</a>. This parallel curve of a Pythagorean Hodograph is an exact parametric polynomial curve, but approximation techniques are still needed in practice, both to convert the source curve into the representation, and because the resulting curves are higher order rational polynomials, which require further approximation to convert into, say, cubic Béziers.</p>

<p>Specifically, this blog proposes piecewise Euler spirals as a curve representation particularly well suited to the parallel curve problem.</p>

<p>There’s an implementation of many of these ideas (currently still in PR stage) in <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo</a>. I also used a colab notebook to explore a bunch of the math, and I’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/raphlinus.github.io/blob/master/assets/Euler_spiral_scratchpad.ipynb">copy of that available</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-cusp">The cusp</h2>

<p>One of the things that makes parallel curves special is that cusps often appear. In particular, a cusp appears whenever the radius of curvature of the source curve matches the offset. This is classified as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity)">ordinary cusp</a> and is a feature of many curve families – we’ll quantify that a bit more below.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-cusp.svg" alt="Parallel curve of an Euler spiral, showing the cusp"></p>

<p>A common feature of algorithms for computing parallel curves is identifying the location of the cusp, and subdividing there. That basically means solving for the specific value of curvature (the reciprocal of the offset distance). If the source curve is a cubic Bézier, there can be up to four such cusps, and finding them requires some nontrivial numerical solving.</p>

<h2 id="curvature-as-a-function-of-arclength">Curvature as a function of arclength</h2>

<p>A theme of my approach to parallel curves (and much of my curve work in general, including my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a>), is to consider the relationship of curvature to arclength. A concrete intuition is that it is the position of the steering wheel as a car drives along the curve at constant speed. For some curves, curvature can be represented as a closed-form analytical formula as a function of arclength (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_equation">Cesàro equation</a>), but in general determining the relation requires numerical techniques. For example, in the <a href="https://levien.com/euler_explorer/">Euler explorer</a>, there’s a plot of curvature as a function of arclength below the interactive cubic Bézier. Experimenting with that is an excellent way to develop intuition.</p>

<p>One curve that <em>does</em> have an especially simple Cesàro equation is the Euler spiral. An Euler spiral segment has this formula:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 s\]

</p><p>(A note for those trying to follow along with the detailed math and code: most of the math and numerical code uses $-0.5 \leq s \leq 0.5$ because it helps exploit even/odd symmetries, but the convention for parametrized curves, including the <a href="https://docs.rs/kurbo/0.8.0/kurbo/trait.ParamCurve.html">ParamCurve</a> trait in kurbo, is $0 \leq s \leq 1$. Thus, you’ll frequently see offsets of 0.5. Similarly, you’ll see various scaling to the actual arc length, while the parametrized curve convention assumes an arc length of 1. In this blog, we’ll skim over such details, as the goal is to provide intuition without too much clutter from details.)</p>

<h2 id="the-parallel-curve-of-an-euler-spiral">The parallel curve of an Euler spiral</h2>

<p>In general, most curves do not have a simple formula for their parallel curve. The obvious exception is a circular arc, for which the parallel curve is another circular arc. Another curve family with tractable representation for its parallel curve is Pythagorean Hodographs.</p>

<p>Thanks to its exceptionally simple formulation as a Cesàro equation, the Euler spiral is one of the rare curves with a simple closed-form equation for its parallel curve. That equation was first published in a 1906 paper by Heinrich Wieleitner, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=UvpZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=%22Die+Parallelkurve+der+Klothoide%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fuY39VdPpd&amp;sig=K0AbL03rXAm_g4J9KsheQbbxyaA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUrcD1poTfAhVvFjQIHVthBPoQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Die%20Parallelkurve%20der%20Klothoide%22&amp;f=false">Die Parallelkurve der Klothoide</a>. For those who don’t read German, <a href="https://github.com/Rahix">Rahix</a> has kindly provided a translation into English: <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.text">TeX source</a>.</p>

<p>Going over this math, I see Wieleitner missed an opportunity for further simplification. The style at the time was to write the Cesàro equation in terms of the <em>radius</em> of curvature (the reciprocal of curvature), but especially for the Euler spiral and its parallel curve, using curvature directly yields a much simpler equation. With the cusp located at $s_0$, the equation is gratifyingly simple:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \frac{c}{\sqrt{s - s_0}} + \frac{1}{l}\]

</p><p>The equation is graphed below, and clicking on it links to a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac">Desmos calculator graph</a> with sliders for the parameters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac"><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-spiral-parallel-cesaro.png" width="400" height="400"></a></p>

<p>Here $c$ is a coefficient dependent on the parameters of the spiral. To connect it to the notation in the Wieleitner paper, $c = a / \sqrt{2 l^3}$, and $s_0 = -a^2/{2l}$. I’ve also made a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/imvqywsb8o">Desmos calculator graph</a> that interactively demonstrates the equivalence of this equation and the more involved one from the Wieleitner paper.</p>

<p>There are a number of other curves that have a cusp similar to the above, with characteristic inverse-square root curvature. The clearest connection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">circle involute</a>, which is the same but without the $1/l$ term, or in other words the Euler spiral parallel curve approaches the circle involute as the offset goes to infinity. This provides intuition for the fact that a circle involute is its own parallel curve. The circle involute is perhaps most famous as the optimized profile for meshing <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gears/">gear</a> teeth, transferring force smoothly with no slop or friction.</p>

<p>Other curves with a similar cusp include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a> (as well as its many variants including epicycloid, hypocycloid, astroid, deltoid, cardioid, and nephroid), as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicubical_parabola">semicubical parabola</a>. The latter is of particular interest because it can be exactly represented as a case of a cubic Bézier (it is when the control arms form a symmetrical X).</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/semicubical_parabola.svg" alt="semicubical parabola"></p>

<p>The parallel curve of the Euler spiral is perfectly cromulent, and, following the tradition of Pythagorean Hodograph curves and their higher-order rational polynomials, we could simply require everything downstream to simply deal with them. But to make that downstream processing easier, we will convert back to piecewise Euler spirals, a more tractable representation.</p>

<h2 id="geometric-hermite-interpolation">Geometric Hermite interpolation</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_interpolation">Hermite interpolation</a> is a well known technique. In its simplest form, it is used to generate a piecewise polynomial approximation to some function, where the parameters for each polynomial segment are determined from the values and derivatives of the endpoints. For example, in cubic Hermite interpolation, a cubic polynomial is determined from the values and first derivatives at the endpoints – four values, corresponding to four coefficients for the polynomial. The result is C1 continuous as the derivatives exactly match (and are equal to the source curve).</p>

<p>In 2D, there is a distinction between C1 and G1 (geometric) continuity. In C1 continuity, the full derivatives must match, both direction and magnitude. For applications such as animating motion curves, the magnitude is important (it represents speed of motion), but for curves, it is not. G1 continuity requires that the tangents match, but does not specify the magnitude of the derivatives.</p>

<p>In these applications, geometric Hermite interpolation is more efficient, as all parameters of the curve are available to make the shape fit. The Euler spiral is especially well suited to geometric Hermite interpolation, and there is literature on this topic. For reasonable assumptions of smoothness (excluding fractal curves but including simple cusps), the accuracy scales as $O(n^4)$ – a doubling of the number of subdivisions reduces the error by a factor of 16. This scaling is the same as cubic Hermite interpolation of a 1D function, not surprising as an Euler spiral segment approximates a cubic polynomial when $y$ values are small.</p>

<p>Section 8.2 of my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a> provides a secant method for determining the Euler spiral parameters from the G1 Hermite constraints, and that’s implemented in the <code>fit_euler</code> method in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo PR</a>. That’s a good technique and its convergence is excellent (quadratic, as typical for Newton-style solvers for near-linear problems), but I’ve also been experimenting with ways to do it better. The linked notebook explores a polynomial approximation (based on 2D Taylor’s series) that is much faster – 7ns vs 240ns in my measurements, and should be very accurate over a wide range of parameters. I’m not quite done making the error bounds rigorous, but this approach should help make the overall algorithm lightning-fast.</p>

<p>Geometric Hermite interpolation works well to approximate the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment with another Euler spiral segment:</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-approx.svg" alt="Approximation of the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment"></p>

<p>The true parallel curve is in blue, and the approximation in red. It has the same rough shape, but bulges out in the middle. We need to be able to estimate that error in order to make a more accurate approximation.</p>

<h3 id="a-simple-accurate-error-metric">A simple, accurate error metric</h3>

<p>The most common approach to approximation given a target error bound is adaptive subdivision: approximate the error, and if it exceeds the target, subdivide. Evaluating the error is not always easy; most generally, it’s based on numerical techniques such as evaluating the curve at several points along its length and testing how near those points lie to the source curve.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for approximating an Euler spiral parallel curve using an Euler spiral, there is an extremely simple formula for the error. In fact, it’s possible to avoid the adaptive subdivision altogether, and precisely predict how many subdivisions are needed to meet an error bound, as well as analytically place the subdivisions so each segment has the same error.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Sixty years ago, the scientists who were pioneering the technology that would make today's COVID-19 vaccines possible were mocked and dismissed</p><div>
																		<p>A few days before Christmas, Matthew Meselson, a 90-year-old professor at Harvard, called his university’s health service to inquire about being vaccinated against COVID-19. He was eager for his shot. Meselson felt imprisoned in his Cambridge apartment, just blocks from the campus where he’d worked for six decades. He’d officially retired from teaching at the beginning of 2020, but continued his research as much as possible throughout the pandemic, wearing a K95 mask to work in his lab.</p>
<p>He longed to re-engage in the world around him. He missed his weekly date with close friends over lunch at Boston’s best French restaurant; they’d switched to Zoom, but staring into a computer screen is no replacement for lingering at linen-covered tables. He longed for his wife of 32 years, Jeanne Guillemin, who died from cancer late in 2019. Meselson was still figuring out how his world worked without her, and isolation made this hard task harder.</p>
<p>The person on the other end of the phone apologized to the professor. “We don’t have a vaccine schedule yet,” she told him.</p>
<p>The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be approved for use in North America were developed, tested and delivered into freezers before many jurisdictions figured out how to administer them. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are the first approved vaccines ever to employ modified mRNA, which is delivered sealed in a lipid shell. The mRNA slips into our cells, carrying instructions to make antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines function almost like a wanted poster: if you see these guys, get ’em. Then, the mRNA degrades, leaving no trace.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/covid-19-vaccines-curbing-pandemic-vaxx-populi/">How quickly will the COVID-19 vaccines start curbing the pandemic in Canada?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that mRNA is the basis of these vaccines contributed to their rapid development. In November, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that within two days of China releasing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, scientists at Moderna Inc., a 10-year-old company headquartered not far from Meselson’s home in Cambridge, “plugged that data into its computers and came up with a design for an mRNA vaccine.” Meanwhile, BioNTech, a small biotech company in Germany that had been working on mRNA flu vaccines with the pharmaceutical powerhouse Pfizer, soon similarly turned its resources to generating an mRNA COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>But these fastest vaccines in history have been decades in the making. They’re the product of generations of scientists who built on one idea after another, and kept at it despite failed experiments, rejections, threats of deportation, a lack of funding and skepticism from contemporaries. They were inspired by the discovery of DNA: in 1951, a young English physical chemist named Rosalind Franklin took X-ray photographs that captured DNA’s helical shape; two years later, James Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University published the first report describing DNA’s double helix, for which they received the Nobel Prize. (Franklin died of ovarian cancer in 1958; her contributions were largely overlooked in her lifetime.) And they were driven not by a race to halt a raging pathogen or by the chance to patent a multi-billion-dollar drug, but by one big, irresistible question: What makes life?</p>
<p>“These weren’t people who wanted to solve little problems,” says Meselson. “These were people who wanted to solve a great big problem.”</p>
<p>He was one of them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Born in Colorado in 1930, Meselson zipped through the sciences at a young age. By 16, he enrolled at the University of Chicago. In 1957, while doing post-doctoral work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Meselson and Frank Stahl demonstrated how DNA replicates itself, a model that had been suggested but never shown. Science historian Frederic Lawrence Holmes later characterized their work as “the most beautiful experiment in biology,” having revealed how life worked.</p>
<p>But many unanswered questions remained about what happens inside our cells. Meselson and colleagues knew that DNA resides in the nucleus, a compartment barricaded off from the rest of the cell by a membrane. On the other side of the membrane is the cytoplasm, a gelatinous liquid that fills the remainder of the cell. This is the home of tiny granules called ribosomes, which house RNA.</p>
<p>Around the same time that Meselson and Stahl published their groundbreaking work on DNA, French scientists discovered that cells made proteins through the ribosomes. DNA, despite holding the critical codes for life, is a relatively passive molecule. Ribosomes do the busy labour, building proteins to carry out the biological processes of survival. The question was how?</p>
<p>One of the French scientists, Dr. François Jacob, theorized that there must be an “unstable intermediary” that went between the DNA and the RNA—sending messages from the DNA to the RNA, and then disappearing.</p>
<p>Jacob, a physician who’d been forced from medical school when Germany invaded France in 1940 and spent the war years fighting with Charles de Gaulle’s Free French Forces, called this theoretical intermediary “X.” Other researchers “rolled their eyes in horror” when he presented his theory, Jacob recalled in his memoir, <em>The Statue Within</em>. “With a little encouragement, my audience would have jeered and left,” he wrote.</p>
<div id="attachment_1216833"><p><img data-sizes="auto" src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MATTHEW-MESELSON-DNA-FRANGOU-FEB02-766x431.jpg" alt="Meselson at Caltech in 1958 (Courtesy of the Caltech Archives)" width="766" height="431"></p><p>Meselson at Caltech in 1958 (Courtesy of the Caltech Archives)</p></div>
<p>In spring 1960, Jacob wrote to Meselson with a proposal: he and Sydney Brenner, a South African biologist at the University of Cambridge, would meet at Meselson’s lab at Caltech to find X. Meselson, who was in his first year on faculty, had developed a technique to track smaller molecules inside a cell. Jacob believed this technique would help identify X. That summer, with Jacob and Brenner in his lab, Meselson set up initial cultures and tests. Brenner took over the operations, while Jacob sat in a chair taking notes—pain from bomb fragments in his legs was worsened by the California humidity, says Meselson. For three weeks, they met with one failure after another. The ribosomes kept falling apart. Other scientists poked their heads in periodically and asked sarcastically for news of X. Jacob wrote that they “came to visit as one would visit the zoo.” On the trio’s very last scheduled day in the lab, Meselson, having given up on X, left. He flew to Boston to propose to his first wife.</p>
<p>Dejected, Jacob and Brenner went to Malibu Beach. The duo lay on the beach, watching huge waves of the Pacific crashing onto the sand and contemplating where their idea had gone wrong. Jacob wrote in his memoir: “Suddenly, Sydney gives a hoot. He leaps up, yelling, ‘The magnesium! It’s the magnesium!’ ” They raced back to the lab to run the experiment one last time, with additional magnesium. The result was spectacular. X existed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/theres-a-new-strain-of-covid-19-will-the-vaccines-work-against-it/">There’s a new strain of COVID-19. Will the vaccines work against it?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The pair gave a seminar the same day at Caltech to demonstrate X. Even then, no one believed them. They contacted Meselson in Boston that night to tell him. He was delighted. “It didn’t occur to me that they would figure out what was going wrong on the very last day,” he says. When the trio published their findings in 1961, they renamed X as messenger RNA.</p>
<p>They did not imagine that their finding would be used for therapeutics or a vaccine. Their questions were more philosophical. Meselson says, “We wondered what is it that allows you to put together the atoms of the ordinary periodic chart and end up with something that’s alive?”</p>
<p>Their work became the central tenet of molecular biology: DNA makes RNA makes protein makes life. It took another generation of scientists to find a way to harness RNA to treat and prevent illness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As a kid in Kisújszállás, Hungary, Katalin Karikó watched her father, a butcher, dismember the carcasses of pigs. It was her first introduction to science. In the 1970s, while studying biochemistry at the University of Szeged, Karikó heard about a new report from London: interferon, a type of protein made by the body to trigger a defence against a virus, was mediated by an RNA called 2-5A. Karikó remembers a mentor talking to her about the discovery and being thrilled by the possibilities. He suggested to her that if they could make a synthetic version of a 2-5A molecule, they might be able to treat cancer or viral disease. “I immediately thought that what I was doing was tremendously important,” she says. It was the start of a 40-year quest to make synthetic RNA that could cure illness.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t secure funding in Hungary. Married with a two-year-old daughter, Karikó saw no way to continue her work in her home country. She wrote to professors throughout Europe about joining their labs, but no one could hire her. In 1985, she received an offer from Temple University in Philadelphia. If she could get to the United States, a job was waiting for her.</p>
<p>At the time, Hungarian money could not legally be converted to another currency and taken out of the country. Worried about how their family would survive until her first paycheque, Karikó and her husband, Bela Francia, sold their Russian-made car and converted the proceeds on the black market for a total of 900 British pounds. They sewed the money into their daughter’s teddy bear to smuggle it out of the country. The teddy bear’s owner, their daughter, Susan Francia, grew up to become a two-time Olympic gold medallist for the United States in rowing.</p>

  <p>This is the first post in a three-part series we are preparing on multi-output Gaussian Processes. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a popular tool in machine learning, and a technique that we routinely use in our work.
Essentially, GPs are a powerful Bayesian tool for regression problems (which can be extended to classification problems through some modifications).
As a Bayesian approach, GPs provide a natural and automatic mechanism to construct and calibrate uncertainties.
Naturally, getting <em>well</em>-calibrated uncertainties is not easy and depends on a combination of how well the model matches the data and on how much data is available.
Predictions made using GPs are not just point predictions: they are whole probability distributions, which is convenient for downstream tasks. There are several good references for those interested in learning more about the benefits of Bayesian methods, from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-bayesian-inference-e6186cfc87bc">introductory</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-bayesian-statistics-used-for">blog posts</a> to <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book0.html">classical</a> <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/">books</a>.</p>

<p>In this post (and in the forthcoming ones in this series), we are going to assume that the reader has some level of familiarity with GPs in the single-output setting.
We will try to keep the maths to a minimum, but will rely on mathematical notation whenever that helps making the message clear.
For those who are interested in an introduction to GPs—or just a refresher—we point towards <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/">other</a> <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/intuitive-intro-to-gaussian-processes-328740cdc37f">resources</a>.
For a rigorous and in-depth introduction, the <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/">book by Rasmussen and Williams</a> stands as one of the best references (and it is made freely available in electronic form by the authors).</p>

<p>We will start by discussing the extension of GPs from one to multiple dimensions, and review popular (and powerful) approaches from the literature.
In the following posts, we will look further into some powerful tricks that bring improved scalability and will also share some of our code.</p>

<h2 id="multi-output-gps">Multi-output GPs</h2>

<p>While most people with a background in machine learning or statistics are familiar with GPs, it is not uncommon to have only encountered their single-output formulation.
However, many interesting problems require the modelling of multiple outputs instead of just one.
Fortunately, it is simple to extend single-output GPs to multiple outputs, and there are a few different ways of doing so. We will call these constructions multi-output GPs (MOGPs).</p>

<p>An example application of a MOGP might be to predict both temperature and humidity as a function of time. Sometimes we might want to include binary or categorical outputs as well, but in this article we will limit the discussion to real-valued outputs.
(MOGPs are also sometimes called multi-task GPs, in which case an output is instead referred to as a task. But the idea is the same.)
Moreover we will refer to inputs as time, as in the time series setting, but all the discussion in here is valid for any kind of input.</p>

<p>The simplest way to extend GPs to multi-output problems is to model each of the outputs independently, with single-output GPs.
We call this model IGPs (for independent GPs). While conceptually simple, computationally cheap, and easy to implement, this approach fails to account for correlations between outputs.
If the outputs are correlated, knowing one can provide useful information about others (as we illustrate below), so assuming independence can hurt performance and, in many cases, limit it to being used as a baseline.</p>

<p>To define a general MOGP, all we have to do is to also specify how the outputs covary.
Perhaps the simplest way of doing this is by prescribing an additional covariance function (kernel) over outputs, \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j)\), which specifies the covariance between outputs \(i\) and \(j\).
Combining this kernel over outputs with a kernel over inputs, e.g. \(k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t')\), the full kernel of the MOGP is then given by</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}

k((i, t), (j, t')) = \operatorname{cov}(f_i(t), f_j(t')) = k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j) k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t'),

\end{equation}\]

</p><p>which says that the covariance between output \(i\) at input \(t\) and output \(j\) at input \(t'\) is equal to the product \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j) k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t')\).
When the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) is a product between a kernel over outputs \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j)\) and a kernel over inputs \(k_{\mathrm{t}}(t,t’)\), the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) is called <em>separable</em>.
In the general case, the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) does not have to be separable, i.e. it can be any arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_function">positive-definite function</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to IGPs, general MOGPs do model correlations between outputs, which means that they are able to use observations from one output to better predict another output.
We illustrate this below by contrasting the predictions for two of the outputs in the <a href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html">EEG dataset</a>, one observed and one not observed, using IGPs and another flavour of MOGPs, the ILMM, which we will discuss in detail in the next section. Contrary to the independent GP (IGP), the ILMM is able to successfully predict F2 by exploiting the observations for F3 (and other outputs not shown).</p>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/eeg.png" alt="IGP_vs_MOGP">
Figure 1: Predictions for two of the outputs in the EEG dataset using two distinct MOGP approaches, the ILMM and the IGP.
All outputs are modelled jointly, but we only plot two of them for clarity.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-to-single-output-gps">Equivalence to single-output GPs</h3>

<p>An interesting thing to notice is that a general MOGP kernel is just another kernel, like those used in single-output GPs, but one that now operates on an <em>extended</em> input space (because it also takes in \(i\) and \(j\) as input).
Mathematically, say one wants to model \(p\) outputs over some input space \(\mathcal{T}\).
By also letting the index of the output be part of the input, we can construct this extended input space: \(\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}} = \{1,...,p\} \times \mathcal{T}\). Then, a multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) can be defined via a mean function, \(m\colon \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}} \to \mathbb{R}\), and a kernel, \(k\colon \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\).
Under this construction it is clear that any property of single-output GPs immediately transfers to MOGPs, because MOGPs can simply be seen as single-output GPs on an extended input space.</p>

<p>An equivalent formulation of MOGPs can be obtained by stacking the multiple outputs into a vector, creating a <em>vector-valued GP</em>.
It is sometimes helpful to view MOGPs from this perspective, in which the multiple outputs are viewed as one multidimensional output.
We can use this equivalent formulation to define MOGP via a <em>vector-valued</em> mean function, \(m\colon \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}^p\), and a <em>matrix-valued</em> kernel, \(k\colon\mathcal{T}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}\). This mean function and kernel are <em>not</em> defined on the extended input space; rather, in this equivalent formulation, they produce <em>multi-valued outputs</em>.
The vector-valued mean function corresponds to the mean of the vector-valued GP, \(m(t) = \mathbb{E}[f(t)]\), and the matrix-valued kernel to the covariance matrix of vector-valued GP, \(k(t, t’) = \mathbb{E}[(f(t) - m(t))(f(t’) - m(t’))^\top]\).
When the matrix-valued kernel is evaluated at \(t = t’\), the resulting matrix \(k(t, t) =  \mathbb{E}[(f(t) - m(t))(f(t) - m(t))^\top]\) is sometimes called the <em>instantaneous spatial covariance</em>: it describes a covariance between different outputs at a given point in time \(t\).</p>

<p>Because MOGPs can be viewed as single-output GPs on an extended input space, inference works exactly the same way.
However, by extending the input space we exacerbate the scaling issues inherent with GPs, because the total number of observations is counted by adding the numbers of observations for each output, and GPs scale badly in the number of observations.
While inference in the single-output setting requires the inversion of an \(n \times n\) matrix (where \(n\) is the number of data points), in the case of \(p\) outputs, assuming that at all times all outputs are observed,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> this turns into the inversion of an \(np \times np\) matrix (assuming the same number of input points for each output as in the single output case), which can quickly become computationally intractable (i.e. not feasible to compute with limited computing power and time).
That is because the inversion of a \(q \times q\) matrix takes \(\mathcal{O}(q^3)\) time and \(\mathcal{O}(q^2)\) memory, meaning that time and memory performance will scale, respectively, cubically and quadratically on the number of points in time, \(n\), and outputs, \(p\).
In practice this scaling characteristic limits the application of this general MOGP formulation to data sets with very few outputs and data points.</p>

<h3 id="low-rank-approximations">Low-rank approximations</h3>

<p>A popular and powerful approach to making MOGPs computationally tractable is to impose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)">low-rank</a> structure over the covariance between outputs.
That is equivalent to assuming that the data can be described by a set of latent (unobserved) Gaussian processes in which the number of these <em>latent processes</em> is fewer than the number of outputs.
This builds a simpler lower-dimensional representation of the data. The structure imposed over the covariance matrices through this lower-dimensional representation of the data can be exploited to perform the inversion operation more efficiently (we are going to discuss in detail one of these cases in the next post of this series).
There are a variety of different ways in which this kind of structure can be imposed, leading to an interesting class of models which we discuss in the next section.</p>

<p>This kind of assumption is typically used to make the method computationally cheaper.
However, these assumptions do bring extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias">inductive bias</a> to the model. Introducing inductive bias <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/supercharge-your-model-performance-with-inductive-bias-48559dba5133">can be a powerful tool</a> in making the model more data-efficient and better-performing in practice, provided that such assumptions are adequate to the particular problem at hand.
For instance, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1183480">low-rank data</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1177153">occurs naturally</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005109807003950">different settings</a>.
This also happens to be true in electricity grids, due to the <a href="https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=econ_las_conf">mathematical structure</a> of the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
							<p><span>I’ve had the chance of talking directly to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@DHH</a>&nbsp;himself, creator of Ruby on Rails, on the 28th of January, mostly about Hotwire (video at the end of the post). Just writing this, as a product guy who never shipped a line of Ruby in production, still feels completely crazy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>How it happened</b></h2>
<p><span>It all started as a joke. At <a href="https://wizville.fr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WizVille</a>, like most startups, we struggle to hire Fullstack Rails developers that match our (rather high) expectations. Which is a problem when your whole strategy is based on changing the way your customers go about their business through technology and innovation. Especially when you feel like you’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/wizville-local-monitor-helps-small-shops-track-google-maps-ratings-of-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cracked it</a> and start having stronger traction than ever, both nationally and internationally, and have had <strong>3 senior Software Engineers positions open for 4 months (see our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/wizville/jobs/ruby-on-rails-developer-experimente-e-h-f-x_paris">remaining open position</a>)</strong>…&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So one night, I call Clément, our CTO, and tell him : « Let’s ask DHH to come talk at our first ever WizVille-hosted tech event!». The idea would be to make a powerful statement to the Rails community in France: « WizVille means business, and takes inspiration from the best, you should join us! ».</span></p>
<p><span>Clément laughed and answered, « well, that’s a crazy idea, but he just launched Hotwire and a new version of Turbo today ». I open Hacker News, « <a href="https://hotwire.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotwire: HMTL over the wire</a> » is the #1 post. I find out about the tech and realize that not only Hotwire is a potential game changer, but also that this is the perfect opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It just took one email, I offered to gather as much of the French Rails community as possible for an event during which he could spread the word about Hotwire, and he accepted within 24 hours. I think he did because the email transpired the fact that I was maybe the most determined guy out there to be willing to gather as much of the Rails community for a dedicated event about HW.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Not just another front-end framework</b></h2>
<p><span>At first, I thought Hotwire wasn’t meant to take over the front-end development game in David’s mind. But <strong>I was shocked by his answers and the displayed pureness of his ambition</strong> on why he created it and shipped HW for the world to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We all know David for his game changing vision with Rails, and his radical approach to working described in Rework and how it influenced the way the tech world sees work. But Rails was launched at a different time, when you’d think the competing technologies were “rather clearly” retrograde.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also know how powerful frameworks like Vue and React are today. </span> <span>So, assuming the potential limitations of Hotwire, since it’s HTML-based, and the incredible contenders there are in the front-end development world (lead by the likes of Facebook, Google…), I never thought David was going to pitch us an upcoming shift in the way apps are created… even though it kinda feels obvious now that he’s described it to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Hotwire could be the future&nbsp;</b></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can learn Hotwire over a week-end according to David. On average it takes about a month or two with React. With V ue, about 2 to 4 weeks.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Having to code everything in Javascript on the front-end has never been a free choice</b><span>: it’s always been a choice made out of the absence of alternatives. With HW, app builders won’t have to deal with the complexities of having developers specialized in a completely different technology. And will use the needed technology for the appropriate goal. That will dramatically increase the developer’s satisfaction since he will be able to use his preferred language and also manage most of the spectrum of web app building himself.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire is an independent project from Rails, which means it works with any back end development framework.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire also works on mobile. Out of Hey’s mobile app’s +100 screens, only one of them is built in native languages. There’s also a misconception about Strada (not released at the moment I’m writing this): it will just give developers a more conventionalized approach for interacting with their native apps, but that’s it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire works for every kind of app, save for apps that really require javascript’s abilities as a technology, and need to work independently in the client (calendars or apps like Figma). That kind of app is a very small fraction, and Hotwire can be combined with a JS framework like React or Vue if needed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>So there you have all the ingredients to replace any front-end framework:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Speed: get your developers up to speed on your front-end framework faster, and therefore potentially ship your product faster</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Simplicity: easier for back-end developers to do otherwise complex front-end work</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Coherent technology choice : use complex front-end frameworks only when needed for some features</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Compatibility : works with all back-end frameworks and all types of web apps</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Main concerns to date&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The main concerns are mostly related to <strong>how little time it’s been since Hotwire has been released</strong>. This means smaller community and stack overflow threads, and also fewer plugins. The most advanced design framework you could use is <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tailwind</a>, a CSS framework. Which may have us coding our own animations or having to combine with other libraries…? </span><span>Also, having to combine front-end frameworks in some cases, doesn’t feel ideal.</span></p>
<p><span>David told us that Hotwire was up to a much stronger start than Rails, so we could expect to have most of those concerns solved along the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>But the mere fact that David Heinemier Hansson deeply believes that his personal mission is to liberate developers from the grip of Single-Page-Apps with Hotwire should definitely have everyone’s attention in Tech. And it definitely has ours at WizVille.&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2><b>About the event&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The event was called « Hotwire &amp; Startups: Dreaming bigger With Rails in 2021 » and you can enjoy David’s 1 hour fireside chat mainly about Hotwire below:&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of developers have been given a new greenfield project to deliver. The powers that be told them they have full control over the technical direction of the project. The team was excited to move on from their legacy project, it was a great opportunity for them to apply the lessons from the old onto the new. They were going to <em>do things properly</em> this time.</p><h2 id="building-a-barn-with-a-golden-hammer">Building a Barn With a Golden Hammer</h2><p>One of the developers closely follows the <a href="https://eng.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Uber Engineering Blog</a> and there she read Uber uses Golang to hit stellar RPS (requests per second) numbers. She proposed that the team writes this project in Golang so they can leverage that same performance.</p><p>The second developer suggested they use React for the frontend and build an SPA (single page application), because that's what everyone's doing these days and it's the de facto standard.</p><p>The last developer found great success with serverless microservices at his previous company. He recommended they leverage the near infinite scalability of the serverless platform for their new project.</p><p>At face value, the plan seemed solid - Golang on the backend, a React SPA on the frontend and it's all going to be served by a serverless microservice infrastructure. It was going to be performant, infinitely scalable and decoupled.</p><p>Executing the plan proved more difficult than they anticipated. It turns out they forgot to take a few things into account.</p><p>The team didn't have any real experience with Golang as they were all primarily PHP developers. Building a React SPA was proving to be a time sink as they now had an additional problem of communicating with APIs. By the time they had 12 microservices, the complexity of their system was causing more issues than it was solving. To add insult to injury, they were only asked to build a very basic inventory management system for internal use.</p><p>Somewhere in the excitement and the prospect of doing it like the big companies the team forgot where they were, what worked for them and what they were building. What they thought they had was a solid architectural foundation to build upon, but what they ended up with was an <em>unarchitecture</em>.</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-unarchitecture">What Exactly is Unarchitecture?</h2><p>I actually borrowed the idea for the word from <a href="https://unarchitecture.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this blog</a> and think it encompasses what I'm trying to convey here. To me, unarchitecture is ill-fitting software architecture, which is often born of best intentions.</p><p>If good software architecture makes a codebase easy and enjoyable to work with, then unarchitecture is the antithesis of that. An unarchitected codebase is a source of endless friction and misery for developers, it makes new features tiresome to develop and fixing bugs a soul-crushing exercise.</p><h2 id="where-and-how-does-it-happen">Where and How Does it Happen?</h2><p>The story in the introduction has a series of questionable decisions that led to unarchitecting the codebase, but in reality all it takes is just one decision to create a pocket of friction in any codebase. For example, you could just over-engineer the CI pipeline and make nobody on your team want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.</p><p>I've found that unarchitecture often comes from a good place. We often tend to apply what we already know as working without really weighing up the pros and cons (everything has cons) of the approaches within our current context. What worked for a company with a team of 20 might not necessarily work for a team of 3. This applies across the board to software packages, languages, libraries, frameworks and patterns.</p><p>I like to think it's akin to wearing your parents shoes when you're 7. You've seen your parents walk in them and you really want to be like the grown ups, but once you try them on you can barely walk in them, much less run.</p><h2 id="preventing-unarchitecture">Preventing Unarchitecture</h2><p>I think there are a few ways we can try and prevent ourselves from unarchitecting our applications:</p><ul><li>We should aim to try and keep things as simple as possible for as long as possible. Introduce complexity only when we really need it.</li><li>Put our ego aside and question whether the pattern or technology we're applying is right for us, within our current context. Some questions that I like to ask myself are:<ul><li>Will my team realistically be able to maintain this? Do we have the skills required currently, can we learn or grow the team to accommodate for what we're trying to achieve?</li><li>Can it stifle future growth? If we're going for simplicity, will it be hard to evolve if we need to?</li><li>If our decision turns out being a mistake, how hard will it be to take a step back and go on a different path?</li><li>Is this something that will bring us value? How? Maybe our efforts are better focused elsewhere?</li></ul></li><li>I'm a big believer in <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-conways-law-improve-your-software-development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Conway's Law</a> and think we should take into account the structure of the organisation when we're architecting our applications. Our architecture should either complement the structure or drive change in the direction that we want to go.</li></ul><h2 id="closing-note">Closing Note</h2><p>In a world where microservices, serverless, Leviathan-esque container orchestration tools and decoupled frontends are all the rage, it's easy to lose sight of where we are and what we're trying to achieve and give in to hype driven development instead.</p><p>I think, in general, we should just strive to approach software architecture with more pragmatism and not give in to dogma. After all, there's no such thing as a panacea.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Parsec</strong> is the <strong>P</strong>latform <strong>A</strong>bst<strong>R</strong>action for <strong>SEC</strong>urity, a new open-source initiative to
provide a common <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/api_overview.html">API</a> to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.</p>
<p>Parsec aims to define a universal software standard for interacting with secure object storage and
cryptography services, creating a common way to interface with functions that would traditionally
have been accessed by more specialised APIs. Parsec establishes an ecosystem of developer-friendly
libraries in a variety of popular programming languages. Each library is designed to be highly
ergonomic and simple to consume. This growing ecosystem will put secure facilities at the fingertips
of developers across a broad range of use cases in infrastructure computing, edge computing and the
secure Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Today's computing platforms have evolved to offer a range of facilities for secure storage and
secure operations. There are hardware-backed facilities such as the Hardware Security Module (HSM)
or Trusted Platform Module (TPM). There are firmware services running in Trusted Execution
Environments (TEE). There are also cloud-based security services. At a bare minimum, security
facilities may be provided purely in software, where they are protected by mechanisms provided in
the operating system.</p>
<p>Over the years, software standards have emerged to allow developers to use these facilities from
their applications. But these standards bring with them the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are defined with the expectation that the caller is the "owner" of the platform, meaning that
it has sole access to the underlying hardware. In reality, this is often not the case, because
the caller might reside in a container or virtual machine, where it is sharing the host hardware
with other applications. Existing software standards do not cater well for this situation.</li>
<li>They are defined exhaustively, with lengthy specifications detailing all permissible operations
and parameters. They are written from the perspective of the security device and its
capabilities, rather than from the perspective of the application and its use case. This can
offer a daunting and bewildering experience for developers, who spend a lot of time and effort
figuring out how to map their use case onto the API. There is nothing to tailor the API so that
it can be consumed easily for common, simple cases.</li>
<li>They are specific to a programming language such as C. To consume them in other languages, it is
necessary to use interoperability layers such as Foreign Function Interface (FFI), which can make
the developer experience even more cumbersome and unnatural. Interoperability layers can also be
a source of vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Standards tend to be adopted based on some knowledge of the target platform. So while it might be
possible for code to be portable across multiple HSM vendors, for example, it is much harder to
make code portable between an HSM-based platform and a TPM-based platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parsec inverts this traditional approach to standardizing security interfaces, and it does so by
putting applications front and center. It offers an API that is no less comprehensive, but it does
so in a way that puts the needs of applications and their common use cases first.</p>
<p>Applications simply want the best-available security, and they want to be able to consume it in a
way that is simple, natural, and hard to get wrong.</p>
<p>The following observations can be made about such applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be written in a variety of programming languages.</li>
<li>They may be written with no explicit knowledge of the hardware capabilities of the target
platform, such as whether an HSM or TPM is available.</li>
<li>They are often sharing the target platform hardware with other applications due to the use of
virtualization or containerization technology.</li>
<li>The secure assets owned by one application must be isolated from those owned by another. For
example, private keys provisioned on a hardware device must be isolated such that only the
provisioning application would be able to perform subsequent operations with those keys.</li>
<li>They have differing requirements in terms of permissible cryptographic algorithms and key
strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>These observations motivate the need for a new platform abstraction that offers a common palette of
security primitives via a software interface that is both agnostic with respect to the underlying
hardware capabilities, and also capable of supporting multiple client applications on the same host,
whether those be within containers or within traditional virtual machines.</p>
<p>Parsec is a new software architecture and ecosystem that addresses this need.</p>

<p>Parsec is founded on the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/security-architectures/platform-security-architecture"><strong>Platform Security Architecture
(PSA)</strong></a>.
The PSA is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture
specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. The PSA provides a recipe,
based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a
hardware and firmware level.</p>
<p>One of the provisions of the PSA is the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto
API</strong></a>.
The PSA Crypto API is a comprehensive library of modern security primitives covering the following
functional areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key provisioning and management</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Signing</li>
<li>Message Authentication Codes (MAC)</li>
<li>Asymmetric encryption</li>
<li>Symmetric encryption</li>
<li>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)</li>
<li>Key derivation</li>
<li>Entropy (random number generation)</li>
</ul>
<p>A crucial characteristic of the PSA Crypto API is that applications always reference the keys
opaquely, making it ideally suited to implementations where keys are provisioned within hardware and
are never exposed.</p>
<p>The PSA Crypto API is defined in the C language. Parsec adopts the operations and contracts of the C
API, and uses them as the basis for a language-independent <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a>. Each <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations">operation</a> is defined,
along with all of its inputs and outputs, as a serializable contract, making it suitable to be
invoked over an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) transport. Parsec maintains functional equivalence
with the PSA Crypto API, but allows for out-of-process callers in any programming language.</p>

<p>The core component of Parsec is the <strong>security service</strong> (or <strong>security daemon</strong>). This is a
background process that runs on the host platform and provides connectivity with the secure
facilities of that host and surfaces the wire protocol based on PSA Crypto.</p>
<p>The security service listens on a suitable transport medium. The transport technology is one of
Parsec's many pluggable components, and no single transport is mandated. Choice of transport is
dependent on the operating system and the deployment. On Linux-based systems where the client
applications are running in containers (isolation with a shared kernel), the transport can be based
on Unix sockets.</p>
<p>Client applications make connections with the service by posting API requests to the transport
endpoint. This is usually done via a client library that hides the details of both the wire protocol
and the transport. This is one of the ways in which the client library simplifies the experience of
Parsec for application developers.</p>
<p>A single instance of the Parsec service executes on each physical host. In virtualized environments,
the Parsec service may reside on a specially-assigned guest, or potentially within the hypervisor.</p>
<p>The security service does not support remote client applications. Each physical host or node must
have its own instance of the service. However, it is possible for the service to initiate outbound
remote calls of other services, such as cloud-hosted HSM services.</p>

<p>In addition to surfacing the common API, the Parsec service is also responsible for brokering access
to the underlying security facilities amongst the multiple client applications. The exact way that
this is done will vary from one deployment to another. (See the section below on pluggable back-end
modules). Some of the brokering functionality may already reside in kernel drivers and other parts
of the software stack. The Parsec service is responsible for creating isolated views of key storage
and cryptographic services for each client application. The secure assets of one client must be kept
protected from those of another.</p>
<p>Central to this multi-tenant operation is the notion of <strong>application identity</strong> and the need for a
separate <strong>identity provider</strong> service. A Parsec-enabled host must contain an identity provider
service in addition to the Parsec service itself.</p>
<p>For more information about application identities and the identity provider, please refer to the
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/system_architecture.html"><strong>system architecture</strong></a> document.</p>

<p>The Parsec service employs a layered architecture, structured into a front-end and a back-end.</p>
<p>The front-end module provides the transport endpoint and listens for connections from clients. The
front-end understands the wire protocol and the common API. It is responsible for serialization and
de-serialization of the operation contracts.</p>
<p>The back-end modules are known as <strong>providers</strong>. An instance of the Parsec security service can load
one or more providers. Providers implement the API operations using platform-specific or
vendor-specific code. They provide the "last mile" of connectivity down to the underlying hardware,
software or firmware.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into the modular structure of the Parsec service, please take a look at the
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/interfaces_and_dataflow.html"><strong>interfaces and dataflow</strong></a> design document.</p>
<p>Then delve into the <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/source_code_structure.html"><strong>source code</strong></a> to discover the
back-end provider modules that exist. If you cannot find one that is compatible with the platform
you intend to use, then please consider contributing a new provider.</p>

<p>A key aim of Parsec is to evolve an ecosystem of developer-friendly client libraries in multiple
programming languages.</p>

<p><strong>The plan is great when the backup plan is excellent!</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-that">What is that?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup is a <em>simple</em> command line wrapper of rsync for <em>complex</em> task, written in python.</p>

<h2 id="why-butterfly">Why butterfly?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup exploits the potential of rsync with maximum simplicity, maximum flexibility and more. Moreover,
its greatest strength is the organization of backups in a catalog, easy to consult.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do">What can I do?</h2>
<p>With Butterfly Backup I can perform single or group backups (Full, Incremental, Differential and Mirror), restore, export, list and archive old backups.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-do-it">How can you do it?</h2>
<p>Naturally through the synergy of rsync and OpenSSH technology and the power of Python..</p>

<h2 id="which-platforms-support">Which platforms support?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup can backup Linux, BSD, MacOSX and Windows(with cygwin, see <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">config docs</a>)</p>

<h2 id="real-uses">Real uses</h2>
<p>This list consists of only a few examples; applications can be endless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backing up periodically (ex. once a month) a folder where I store my photos over the years;</li>
  <li>Log’s backup of one or more servers;</li>
  <li>Backup of users of one or more machines;</li>
  <li>Backup system config of much servers;</li>
  <li>Create a backup snapshot of the my laptop;</li>
  <li>Create a central server than backupping client and server;</li>
  <li>Backup a entire file server, incrementally;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-possibilities">Real possibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration for silently or bulk backup</li>
  <li>All backup are organized into a catalog</li>
  <li>List single or all backup by the catalog</li>
  <li>List detail of a single backup</li>
  <li>Backup single PC, with Full,Incremental,Differential and Mirror mode;</li>
  <li>Backup more PCs, with Full,Incremental,Differential and Mirror mode (with parallelism algorithm);</li>
  <li>Backup custom folder or predefined data (User,Config,Application,System,Log): see <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#backup">backup docs</a></li>
  <li>Restore backup on the same PC</li>
  <li>Restore backup in other PC</li>
  <li>Restore backup in other operating system</li>
  <li>Apply retention policy to delete old backup</li>
  <li>Archive old backup in other file system or same (zip backup folder)</li>
  <li>Export one backup to another file system</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Transform rsync in a powerfully backup/restore/archive tool</strong></p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>All operation of Butterfly Backup are <em>server to client</em>, agent-less. The server must be Unix machine with latest rsync installed.
This means that all commands must be executed by the backup server. Of course, nothing prevents the backup server from being itself (localhost).</p>

<p>To see all the operations and more examples, see the <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="test">Test</h2>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Install Butterfly Backup is very simple; run this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/Butterfly-Backup.git
<span>cd </span>Butterfly-Backup
<span>sudo </span>python3 setup.py
bb <span>--help</span>
man bb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="backup-machine">Backup machine</h3>
<p>Backup a single PC or server is a everyday task.
But most of the data may not change in the various backups made;
then, in these cases, an incremental backup is needed.
Butterfly Backup natively supports incremental and differential backups, starting from a full.
In this case, the first backup to be performed on the machine will be as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--destination</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--data</span> User Config <span>--type</span> MacOS <span>--mode</span> Full
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or with short option:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>-c</span> pc1 <span>-d</span> /nas/mybackup <span>-D</span> User Config <span>-t</span> MacOS <span>-m</span> Full
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we created a first <em>Full</em> backup, on a <em>MacOS</em> machine, considering the folders <em>User</em> -&gt; /Users and <em>Config</em> -&gt; /private/etc in the destination <em>/nas/mybackup</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: if you do not specify the user, Butterfly Backup will assume that the source and the destination know the same user; for example, I start the backup with the above command and my user is calling <em>arthur</em>, he will use the latter to log in to pc1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we have our first Full backup, we can run <em>incremental</em> for the next few times.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--destination</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--data</span> User Config <span>--type</span> MacOS
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or with short option:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>-c</span> pc1 <span>-d</span> /nas/mybackup <span>-D</span> User Config <span>-t</span> MacOS
</code></pre></div></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: Incremental mode performs a Full backup when they have not been done before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="restore-machine">Restore machine</h3>
<p>Before starting any restore, you need to understand what kind of data and in what time period you have to start.
So, let’s start checking our backups, with this command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb list <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The result will be the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>BUTTERFLY BACKUP CATALOG

Backup <span>id</span>: f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-03 17:50:36

Backup <span>id</span>: 4f2b5f6e-9939-11e8-9ab6-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-06 07:26:46

Backup <span>id</span>: cc6e2744-9944-11e8-b82a-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-06 08:49:00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Select (copy) <em>Backup id</em> when you want restore a backup.
For exit, press <code>q</code>
Now, run this command for more detail (for example, try the first):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb list <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--backup-id</span> f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The result will be the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Backup <span>id</span>: f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Type: Full
Timestamp: 2018-08-03 17:50:36
Start: 2018-08-03 17:50:36
Finish: 2018-08-03 18:02:32
OS: MacOS
ExitCode: 0
Path: /nas/mybackup/pc1/2018_08_03__17_50
List: etc
Users
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now that we are sure that the selected backup is what we want (both in data and on date), run this command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb restore <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--backup-id</span> f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have restored the data saved on the date indicated in our <em>pc1</em>.</p>

<h3 id="other-operation">Other operation</h3>
<p>With Butterfly Backup, you can perform Full, Incremental and Mirror backups, applying retention or archive rules;
you can activate the log function, so as to track any operation over time and/or increase verbosity.
Bulk backup operations can be performed using a simple text file, formatted in a list.
Is possible create, by means of openssh operations, a configuration and copy them into the machines impacted by the backup without causing the machine to request the password (key exchange).
For all this, <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Read the Docs</a> or run help:</p>




<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>
<p>The name butterfly, is born precisely because agent-less; like a butterfly takes the pollen from a flower and brings it elsewhere.
A backup or restore is performed without any iteration responsibility on the part of the final machine.
The performances are not altered.
While all the operations of Butterfly Backup are carried out, the impacted machine can continuously work with <em>peace of mind</em>.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Do you want to use Higher Kinded Types (<code>HKT</code>) in Rust? Are you tired of waiting for <code>GAT</code>? Well, this is the place to be.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to understand <code>HKT</code> by analogy. In programming we have many different tiers of abstractions. Starting at the bottom we have <code>term</code>s (aka values) like <code>0</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>"hello world!"</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>term</code>s that share a property, we use <code>type</code>s. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit integer, we use <code>i32</code></li>
  <li>utf-8 strings, we use <code>&amp;str</code> or <code>String</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use snake case to refer to <code>term</code>s generically like <code>x</code>, <code>im_an_integer</code>, and <code>database_connection</code>. We use functions to operate on these generic values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_one</span><span>(</span>
    <span>// a generic 32-bit integer</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers, we come to <code>type</code>s. For example: <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, or <code>bool</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>type</code>s that share a property, we use <code>trait</code>s and generics. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>types that can be debug printed, we use <code>std::fmt::Debug</code></li>
  <li>types that can be iterated, we use <code>Iterator</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use pascal case to refer to <code>types</code>s generically like <code>T</code>, <code>Self</code>, and <code>This</code>. We use generic functions to work with these generic types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>print</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Debug</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers again, we come to <code>kind</code>s. For example: <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code>, or <code>Vec</code>. Wait what. Let’s take a step back. Before I mentioned that <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, and <code>bool</code> are types. We also have more types that we can use, generic types like <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> or <code>Result&lt;String, String&gt;</code>. What if you want to generalize over these types? Something of the form <code>T&lt;U&gt;</code>. That’s where we get to kinds. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>i32</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>'a</code> has the kind <code>Lifetime</code></li>
  <li><code>Option</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>W H A T, let’s stop and explain what’s going on here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generic types can be represented as a function from kinds to kinds. For example, <code>Option</code> is a function that takes a <code>Type</code> and produces a <code>Type</code> (hence <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>). Let’s see some more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Result</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>I’ll use this notation because that’s how it’s done in the literature</li>
      <li>Note: this is equivalent to <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code> (you can always transform a function that take a tuple of arguments into one that takes multiple arguments, and vice versa)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>references have a kind <code>Lifetime -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&amp;'a T</code>, one lifetime and one type parameter :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>arrays have the kind <code>Type -&gt; usize -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[T; len]</code>, one type and one <code>usize</code> <code>term</code> (getting close to dependent types, something we won’t touch in this post)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With this notion of <code>kind</code>s we are now well equipped to generalize over generics. Just one cinch, <code>Rust</code> doesn’t know about <code>kind</code>s! So how do we generalize over generics if we can’t even express the fundamental building blocks.</p>



<p>The key insight is that we can represent <code>kind</code>s as a system of types and traits. For example, here’s how to handle <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> kinds.</p>

<p>Note: I’ll show how <code>Option</code> fits in, and introduce <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code>, but I’ll leave the implementation of <code>Vec</code> to you. It’s an interesting puzzle if you are inclined</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// `Option` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// we'll represent it with `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>OptionFamily</span><span>;</span>
<span>// `Result` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// so we fill in one of the types with a concrete one</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// I'll leave the implementation of `VecFamily` to you</span>

<span>// This trait represents the `kind` `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// This represents the output of the function `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
    <span>// for a specific argument `A`.</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `OptionFamily` represents `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
    <span>// so filling in the first argument means</span>
    <span>// `Option&lt;A&gt;`</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// note how all results in this family have `E` as the error type</span>
    <span>// This is similar to how currying works in functional languages</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how a <code>trait</code> can act as a function over types, so you can encode the idea <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> using a trait!</p>

<p>Let’s also introduce a type alias for ease of use.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Option&lt;A&gt; == This&lt;OptionFamily, A&gt;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>as</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>This</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can replace all usage of <code>Option</code>, <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code> with <code>OptionFamily</code> or <code>ResultFamily&lt;E&gt;</code>! From this we can build up abstractions that “require” HKT. Let’s start with the simplest abstraction <code>Functor</code>. This is just any <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> that has a notion of mapping a value. Generally <code>Functor</code> represents a collection, but it can do much more than that (But I won’t dive into <code>Functor</code> in particular in this post).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite a lot, so let’s soak it in.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we require that our families can be used with either type. This allows you to restrict the families in some ways, for example for <code>HashSet</code>, only allow <code>T: Hash + Eq</code>. <code>A</code> will be the input type, and <code>B</code> will be the output type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we have this monstrous function! This will be easier to explain if we have a concrete family.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this is just the same as the ordinary map in <code>Option</code>, except it requires <code>Fn</code>, instead of <code>FnOnce</code>. We could generalize over <code>Fn</code> and <code>FnOnce</code> if Rust had associated traits, but alas we don’t, so we’ll have to make do with <code>Fn</code> (I’ll leave it to you to figure out a nice way to abstract over <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code> and <code>FnOnce</code>). All we’ve done is generalize it to <em>any</em> family, not just <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Copy</code> bound is nice for things like <code>Vec</code> where you need to apply the function multiple times. You can convert any <code>Fn</code> to a <code>Fn + Copy</code> because <code>&amp;_</code> implement <code>Fn</code> and are <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<p>So all together again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Functor</code> just specifies a mapping operation. We can implement this rather easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// I'm not cheating!</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, but that’s boring, I hear you say. What about <code>Monad</code>? Typically it’s defined by it’s <code>bind</code> operation (We’ll skip <code>Applicative</code> here, try it out yourself!). I’m not going to explain how <code>Monad</code> works, or why you would want it, just how to implement it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks the same as <code>Functor</code> to me! … Wait, the bound on <code>F</code> looks funky. Let’s dig in to the <code>OptionFamily</code> implementation again, maybe that will clear things up.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks very familiar, … where have I seen this before? <code>Option::and_then</code> is that you?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// It fits 😉</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.and_then</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this way you can implement most, if not all <code>HKT</code> abstractions in stable Rust. However the ergonomics of these abstractions are downright abysmal. Bounds, bounds, bounds <em>everywhere</em>. We saw this a little in <code>Functor&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, we needed <code>OneTypeParam&lt;A&gt; + OneTypeParam&lt;B&gt;</code> (why does family need to be repeated!). Hopefully we can solve this on nightly, find out next time …</p>

<p>If you can’t wait and must know more, check out <a href="https://github.com/rustyyato/type-families"><code>type-families</code></a>, an experimental crate that implements the ideas outlined in this blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Manipulating a web browser environment with an API provides a wide range of automation capabilities for developers. It allows you to generate PDF files, screenshot webpages, or run health checks on a website, all from code. It can also enable you to automate form submissions, build UI tests, or diagnose performance issues. <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md">Headless Chromium</a> is a popular package for operating a browser programmatically. Whether you are load testing a website or periodically fetching content, this can be configured with minimal code.&nbsp;</p><p>You can run a headless browser on your local development machine or a remote server. However, many typical browser automation tasks are a good fit for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. You can configure a Lambda function to start on a schedule, or in response to an event. You can also configure Lambda to scale up for load testing operations, making it a cost effective alternative to managing a fleet of instances.</p><p>In this blog post, I show how you can deploy a browser automation task to Lambda. This example uses the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS Serverless Application Model</a> (AWS SAM) to simplify the deployment of cloud resources. You can download the code for this blog post from the companion <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app">GitHub repository</a>. To deploy to your AWS account, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/README.md">README file</a>.</p><h2 id="h-overview">Overview</h2><p>In the example application, a Lambda function is invoked every 15 minutes to take a screenshot of a webpage and save the image to an S3 bucket. The architecture looks like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="622" height="272" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png 622w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></figure><ol><li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/">Amazon EventBridge</a> rule invokes the Lambda function using a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/scheduled-events.html">schedule expression</a>.</li><li>The Lambda function uses Chromium to load the target webpage. Once the page is loaded and rendered, it takes a screenshot.</li><li>The screenshot is saved to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> bucket.</li></ol><h2 id="h-how-the-code-works">How the code works</h2><p>This Node.js example uses an npm package called <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>, which exposes a high-level API to control the Chromium browser. A snippet of the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/src/app.js">Lambda function</a> shows how this works:</p><div><div><div><div><pre>browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
 &nbsp; &nbsp; args: chromium.args,
     defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
 &nbsp;   executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
     headless: chromium.headless,
     ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
});

let page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto(pageURL)
const buffer = await page.screenshot()</pre></div></div></div></div><p>This uses JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await">async/await</a> syntax to avoid callbacks and use sequential code flow. Once the browser object is defined, the code instructs Chromium (via Puppeteer) to fetch the webpage. After the page is loaded and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a> is rendered in the headless Chromium instance, it stores a screenshot of the page in a buffer variable. Finally, the image is written to the S3 bucket:</p><pre>const&nbsp;s3result&nbsp;=&nbsp;await&nbsp;s3
 &nbsp;&nbsp;.upload({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   Bucket:&nbsp;process.env.S3_BUCKET,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key:&nbsp;`${Date.now()}.png`,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body:&nbsp;buffer,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ContentType:&nbsp;'image/png',
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACL:&nbsp;'public-read'
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.promise()

console.log('S3 image URL:', s3result.Location) </pre><p>This uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#upload-property">S3 upload method</a> in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/">AWS SDK for JavaScript</a>. It defines the bucket and key, sets the content type to PNG, and then configures the access control list (ACL) so the object is publicly viewable. Finally, it logs the public URL of the stored object.</p><h2 id="h-packaging-puppeteer-for-the-lambda-function">Packaging Puppeteer for the Lambda function</h2><p>Lambda allows you to package dependencies together with your code as a zip file. The deployment package can be up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">250 MB (unzipped)</a> or 50 MB (zipped, for direct upload). For larger packages, it’s recommended that you use the new <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">container packaging format</a> for Lambda functions, which allows packages of up to 10 GB.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use a tool like AWS SAM or <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless framework</a>, the packages are created on your development machine, then zipped and uploaded to the Lambda service. At runtime, these files are unzipped in the Lambda execution environment when the function is run. These tools can simplify this packaging process and help streamline your deployments.</p><p>However, when you use a dependency that contains a binary, you must ensure that you package a version of the binary that is compatible with the operating system used by Lambda. The Puppeteer package contains an entire Chromium browser bundled into the deployment. Since the browser relies on binaries, npm installs the binary that matches the operating system of your local development machine. However, Lambda requires the binary that matches its underlying operating system, which is Amazon Linux 2.</p><p>To help with this, many popular packages have been converted into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda layers</a> by the community. You can define up to five layers per Lambda function and these are copied into your deployment package when you create or update a function. For Chromium, this makes it easier to run one binary version in development and use another binary version at runtime. Learn more about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-lambda-layers-to-simplify-your-development-process/">creating and using Lambda layers</a> to simplify your development process.</p><h2 id="h-using-a-community-maintained-lambda-layer">Using a community-maintained Lambda layer</h2><p>One developer has packaged a <a href="https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda">Chromium binary for AWS Lambda</a> and published this to GitHub. You can install this with Puppeteer in your Lambda function by including the libraries in package.json. You can also bundle both with an existing public Lambda layer. <a href="https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer">This GitHub repo</a> frequently publishes new versions of the <em>chrome-aws-lambda</em> package, which you can include directly in your Lambda function.</p><p>Layers are only available in the AWS Region where they are published. The maintainers of this public repo have published this layer to 16 Regions and provided layer ARNs in the <a href="https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer/blob/master/readme.md">README file</a>. These ARNs are public and you can include in any Lambda function in those Regions in any AWS account.&nbsp;</p><p>These are many popular libraries that have been bundled into Lambda layers by the community. <a href="https://github.com/mthenw/awesome-layers">This GitHub repo</a> aggregates layers for commonly used utilities like GeoIP, MySQL, OpenSSL, Pandas, scikit-learn, and many others. To use these in your Lambda functions from a compatible runtime, you only need to include the layer ARN in a supported Region.</p><h2 id="h-understanding-the-aws-sam-template">Understanding the AWS SAM template</h2><p>The Lambda function in this example could have been defined directly in the AWS Management Console. However, by using AWS SAM, you can define the same infrastructure as code. This helps create repeatable deployments quickly and reduces human error from clicking around the console.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/template.yaml">AWS SAM template</a> defines all the AW resources used by the application. First, it declares an S3 bucket:</p><pre>&nbsp; S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket &nbsp;</pre><p>Next, the template defines the Lambda function and where the code can be found. Since it runs an entire browser within the function, the memory is set to 4096 MB. The timeout is configured to 15 seconds to ensure that the function ends if the target webpage is unresponsive.&nbsp;</p><pre>SnapshotFunction:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Description: Invoked by EventBridge scheduled rule
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Properties:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CodeUri: src/
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Handler: app.handler
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Runtime: nodejs12.x
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Timeout: 15
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MemorySize: 4096 </pre><p>The template includes a reference to the publicly available Chromium layer and substitutes the Region code at deployment time. Providing that the example is deployed in one of those 16 Regions where the layer is available, the layer ARN is valid:</p><pre>Layers:
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:764866452798:layer:chrome-aws-lambda:22'</pre><p>Environment variables are used to set the target website URL and define the bucket name to store the image. Finally, since the function only writes data to S3, it uses an AWS SAM <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html">policy template</a> to provide write permissions to the single bucket. This follows the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege">principle of least privilege</a>:</p><pre>Environment:
 &nbsp;Variables:
 &nbsp; TARGET_URL: 'https://serverlessland.com'
 &nbsp; S3_BUCKET: !Ref S3Bucket
 Policies:
 &nbsp; - S3WritePolicy:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BucketName: !Ref S3Bucket </pre><p>Lambda functions are invoked in response to events. In this case, the function runs at a timed interval, which is managed by EventBridge. Using a schedule expression, the template configures the function to run every 15 minutes:</p><pre>Events:
 &nbsp;CheckWebsiteScheduledEvent:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Type: Schedule
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Properties:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Schedule: rate(15 minutes) </pre><p>Anytime you make changes to the Lambda function or the resource in this template, run <em>sam deploy</em> again to deploy the new version to the AWS Cloud. The AWS SAM CLI detects the differences between versions and deploys the new code and resources automatically.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-testing-the-function">Testing the function</h2><p>After deployment the example application, navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home">Lambda console</a>. Open <em>SnapshotFunction</em> deployed by AWS SAM. The function is invoked automatically every 15 minutes but you can trigger the function by choosing <em>Test</em>:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1008" height="1001" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image002.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image002.png 1008w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image002.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image002.png 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image002.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px"></figure><p>The <em>Log output</em> contains details of the function duration and the public URL of the image that is generated and stored in the S3 bucket.

For many of these, you can use Lambda to minimize infrastructure overhead and simplify scaling. This blog post shows how to deploy an example application that uses a headless browser to take periodic screenshots of a webpage.</p><p>For commonly used libraries or packages with operating-system specific binaries, Lambda layers can help simplify deployment. Many libraries have publicly maintained layers you can include in your Lambda functions. With infrastructure as code tools like AWS SAM, you can define your code and layers together in YAML, to help create repeatable deployments and accelerate development.</p><p>For more serverless learning resources, visit <a href="https://serverlessland.com/">Serverless Land</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have taken a couple terabytes of photos over the years, and have a mild phobia of deleting data, so I keep my photos on a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology DiskStation NAS</a>. I’ve got all the files on the thing:</p><ul><li>backed up to the cloud</li><li>encrypted,</li></ul><p>because back in 2016, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpgY9zAGbD/">apartment was broken into and thieves took all the electronics</a>. I’ve been slightly paranoid ever since.</p><p>The Synology NAS generally works pretty well, but the interface for decrypting a drive after booting is <em>extremely</em> painful. It’s about 10 clicks, a username, two different passwords, and a UI that is kinda wonky (it’s a desktop in a web browser)? Here’s a screengrab:</p><figure><video alt="Unlocking an encrypted drive in the Synology DiskStation UI" src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/decrypt.mp4" width="588" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><p>22 seconds is my personal speed record.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There are alternative solutions to this – you can set it up so that it <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_encrypt_and_decrypt_shared_folders_on_my_Synology_NAS#t4_1">reads the encryption key from a USB disk on startup, for example</a> – but, if I’m worried about the whole thing being stolen, it’s not a good idea to leave the encryption keys plugged into the thing, and it’s also not a nice UX to find and plug in a USB before turning the thing on.</p><p>This… seems kinda silly to me, and something that should be solvable with ✨ <em>technology</em> ✨. I’m only ever accessing this from one computer, for example, and every modern operating system has a good credential storage system (think <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac"><em>Keychain Access</em></a> on OSX or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0"><em>Credential Manager</em></a> on Windows 10). So, maybe my computer could take care of supplying encryption keys to the DiskStation!</p><p>I went looking for options, and discovered that the DiskStation Software has a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf">publicly-documented web API (pdf)</a>. At least, a <em>mostly</em> publicly documented web API – there’s no documentation for the methods to mount and unmount encrypted shares.</p><p>That web API is <em>also</em> used by the desktop software though! So it should theoretically be possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser devtools</a> to see exactly <em>what</em> is being sent to the DiskStation. 🤔</p><p>So, I clicked on all the right things in the Web UI, got to the bit where you type in the password, opened the devtools to the “Network Requests” tab, typed in <code>abc123</code> as my password, hit “send” and then watched for the requests:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/encryption-dot-cgi.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing a request to an ominously-named 'encryption.cgi'"><figcaption><p>hmmmmmmmmmmm</p></figcaption></figure><p>Hmmm, that <code>encryption.cgi</code> looks a little ominous. I wonder what’s in it?</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/public-key.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing huge blob of base16-encoded public-key"><figcaption><p>Yep, looks like encryption, alright</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, a public key. And then the web interface loads a spinner, and makes a request to <code>entry.cgi</code>. Let’s take a look at the contents of that request:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ciphertext.png" alt="A devtools screenshot, showing a jumbled blob of base64-encoded data with the phrases 'rsa' and 'aes' sprinkled throughout."><figcaption><p>HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so if we want to send a magic request to mount the encrypted share, it’s not going to be enough to supply the encryption password; we’re also going to need to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> supply it – how to <em>encrypt</em> the encryption password, so to speak.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-this-crypto-system">So, what is this crypto system?</h2><p>Right. Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>First, we fetch the <code>public_key</code> from the server. That’s the call to the <code>encryption.cgi</code> endpoint we saw earlier. This isn’t actually the entire public key, it’s only <em>part</em> of it. In fact, this is a 4096-bit integer, encoded in base-16. The <em>other</em> part of the public key is the number <code>0x10001 == 65537</code>, which is hardcoded into the JavaScript.</li><li>Then, we generate 501 bytes worth of random text from the charset <code>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-/</code> (that’s 77 different possible characters; I have no idea why this set was chosen though!).</li><li>We encrypt that random text using our public key. The encryption method is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2">RSA with PKCS1.5 padding</a>.</li><li>We MD5-hash that random text a bunch of times with an 8-byte salt. The end result of this is 48 bytes which certainly <em>look</em> pretty random to the naked eye.</li><li>We split those 48 bytes into two components – a 32-byte (== 256-bit) key, and a 16-byte initialisation vector.</li><li>Remember the password we typed in? Yeah, I’d forgotten about it too! But now, we <em>finally</em> take that password, and encrypt it with AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCSv7 padding, using the 256-bit key and 16-byte IV we derived in the previous step.</li><li>We bundle the RSA ciphertext, the 8-byte salt, and the AES ciphertext together and ship them across to the DiskStation.</li></ul><p>Still with me? It’s ok if that didn’t all make loads of sense yet; we’ll now go over the interesting bits more closely.</p><h3 id="symmetric--asymmetric-ciphers">Symmetric / Asymmetric Ciphers</h3><p>Fundamentally, we’re using two cryptographic algorithms in concert:</p><ul><li><strong>RSA</strong>: RSA is an <em>asymmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric cryptographic systems have two <em>keys</em> – a public key, which allows only for encryption of the data, and a private key, which allows for both encryption <em>and</em> decryption.</li><li><strong>AES</strong>: AES is a <em>symmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. In symmetric cryptography, all parties have the same key, and that key allows you to both encrypt and decrypt.</li></ul><p>It seems weird that we’re using both of these at the same time, right? But both systems have weaknesses, and mixing them together is an attempt at minimising the disadvantages of both schemes.</p><p>The problem with <em>symmetric</em> crypto systems by themselves is that you need a way to get that one key to every party that needs it. But you can’t just <em>send</em> it to them, because you don’t have a secure channel yet! Your options are:</p><ul><li>Share the key over a different trusted channel beforehand, or</li><li>have both parties derive the same shared key (from e.g. some partial data that they negotiate over the wire beforehand).</li></ul><p>Asymmetric crypto doesn’t have this problem – if you’re able to share a key that can only be used for encrypting and not for decrypting, then the decryption keys never have to leave the recipient machine. You can then encrypt some text, and nobody except for the recipient can decrypt it – not even you! Put it on the internet, write it on a banner attached to the back of a propeller plane – the message will only be readable by the intended recipient.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/your-ciphertext-here.jpg" alt="A propeller plane with a banner reading 'your ciphertext here'"></figure><p>Asymmetric cryptography is <em>slow</em>, though, so doing it for lots of data is going to really hurt performance.</p><p>A common solution is to simply <em>make up</em> a symmetric key, perform some symmetric encryption using that key, then encrypt <em>that</em> key using asymmetric cryptography, and deliver both to the remote party. Then, the remote party can:</p><ul><li>First, perform asymmetric decryption to obtain the symmetric key</li><li>Then, use that symmetric key to decrypt the rest.</li></ul><p>That’s what <em>this</em> particular system is doing. ✨</p><h3 id="a-quick-note-about-rsa">A quick note about RSA</h3><p>I don’t know much about how RSA works, but as part of researching this article I discovered that it’s pretty easy to implement badly, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">extremely difficult to implement well</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/rsa-correct.gif" alt="Two developers correctly implement RSA, 2010, colorised"><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwzHm6buB8">Two developers correctly implement RSA</a>, 2010, colorised</p></figcaption></figure><p>As software developers, we spend a lot of time shipping things once they get to a point of “it looks like it works”. <strong>You can’t take that approach with cryptography</strong>, and because everything is so opaque, it’s a lot easier to declare that your implementation works without realising that it’s missing fundamentals. Like correctness, for example.</p><h3 id="lets-talk-about-random-keyslets-talk-about-you-and-me">Let’s talk about random keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h3><p>Recall that this algorithm is generating 501 random bytes from a 77-character set, and encrypting that with RSA. 501 seemed like an oddly specific number to me; here’s the specific set of circumstances that characterise <em>why</em> we’re generating a string of this length.</p><p>RSA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"><em>block cipher</em></a>, which means it operates on distinct fixed-size blocks of input and produces fixed-size blocks of output. How big can each block be? Well, RSA public keys are made up of two numbers: a (very large) modulus <code>n</code>, and a much smaller exponent <code>e</code>. RSA is capable of encrypting any message that’s smaller than <code>n</code> if you convert it to a number. In our case, we said that our modulus was a seemingly-random 4096-bit integer – that means (approximately) that we can encrypt 512-byte blocks.</p><p>There’s an important implication here: if you don’t have enough input for a block, you need to fill it up somehow. Normally this is called a <em>padding scheme</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in block-based cryptography.</p><p>Now, the system on this NAS in particular uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2.1">PKCS1-v1.5 padding</a>, which prepends the message (before encryption) with 3 bytes of headers <em>plus</em> a minimum of 8 bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of random garbage. That makes 11 bytes out of a 512 byte block, which means we’ve got… 501 bytes left for our message. ✨</p><h3 id="lo-fi-key-derivation">Lo-fi key derivation</h3><p>So… we’ve got this 501-byte string, with each character being one of 77 possibilities, and we think we know <em>why</em> it was chosen to be 501 bytes long. But that’s not going to work for AES-encrypting the password:</p><ul><li>AES requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. That’s 16, 24, or 32 bytes respectively, but we’ve got <em>lots</em> more than that.</li><li>We can’t, however, just take a subset of bytes from the text and go from there – because they’re selected from a narrow subset of possible bytes (77 out of 255!), you’d be losing an <em>enormous</em> amount of entropy in the key, making the encrypted text about 44,000,000,000,000,000 times<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> easier to break.</li></ul><p>These constraints need to be managed. We can smooth over both by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a>, based on repeated rounds of MD5 hashing and concatenating. Hash algorithms, in general, are good for this because they map input data to… not random, but random-<em>looking</em> output data.</p><p>I like to think of hashing as “entropy laundering” – if you’ve got 256 bits of entropy in a 16kB file, taking the first 256 bits will give you only 64 bits of entropy. If you hash the whole 16kB file, then the entropy goes back up to the maximum of the entropy in the file and the entropy provided by the hash algorithm. This works because hash algorithms are designed to exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche effect</a>.</p><p>I do <em>not</em> have the tools or experience to evaluate whether this specific scheme is secure or not (this one seems esoteric, and the <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure">use of MD5 is scary</a>!)… so let’s move briskly on.</p><h3 id="aes-encryption">AES-encryption</h3><p>Finally, after a bunch of outdated and somewhat esoteric primitives, we’re back to something that is <em>good</em> and <em>works</em> and <em>only slightly</em> a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">loaded footgun</a> and is <em>still recommended for widespread use!</em> It’s AES with a 256-bit key.</p><p>AES is our symmetric cipher. Like RSA, it operates on blocks of fixed length. <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66314/whats-the-best-block-cipher-mode-of-operation-for-rsa/66321#66321">Unlike RSA</a>, these blocks can be chained together. The strategies to do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">“Block cipher modes of operation”</a>, and AES implementations ship with a number of them.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 2: Screenshot: <a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png" rel="nofollow">https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png</a></p>
<p>That was me loading duckduckgo in a different container, with brave, while live fetching DNS requests made to the DNS server. I blurred out the non-onion requests. (Different VPN test location than in the above example so 209.x.x.x IP instead of the 104.x.x.x one in the original example.</p>
<hr><h3>EDIT 2: The mods of /r/privacy won't let this be posted. They say:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While we (vastly) prefer the Tor Browser over the Brave one, you'll need a better source than the one you found. Can you find something from a more widely recognized NetSec expert? Something along the lines of Bruce Schneier's blog or something at that level of credibility?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with screenshots is that they can be faked, trivially. There are also a host of approaches that credible writers/reporters do in the NetSec space do before a line of text appears in print. It's this kind of journalism that we have to trust, since we humble Mods don't have the time or resources to vet. So, we'll need something better sourced. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are new posts everyday "warning" people of things that aren't legitimate, hence the caution. This is not a "security" subreddit. A moderator's job is to ensure that the subreddit doesn't devolve into conspiracy theories and misinformation. Security announcements should be vetted and confirmed, not independent claims that the mods have no time to independently verify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can post the steps on how to easily replicate this by using pi-hole on their local networks. Anyone is capable of verifying this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Please do so on r/brave, r/netsec, r/infosec, and other places where this is both directly relevant and appropriate to seek others confirmation. Once vetted by the community (and republished by professionals), you're welcome to post those official responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/r/brave is private, invite only. I posted on netsec and infosec so we'll see. I guess /r/privacy must love Brave and not allow anything against it since it's so god damned easy to verify this...</p>
<p>All you have to do to VERIFY that this is happening is A.) Use Brave B.) Go to an Onion site C.) Observe DNS traffic. Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi or in a Virtual Machine on your desktop and run your DNS requests through it for ease of use and you can verify it. Not sure why they're so hesitant to inform their subscribers of this.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 3: Tested on both a Debian 10 and Ubuntu desktop. I'm not esteemed NetSec researcher and I'm not setting up a 100 different scenarios.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Not only COVID-19 has brought many challenges to our daily lives, but it also has inspired a lot of change in how we work and do things. Some professions transitioned to remote work more easily than others. Factory workers and machine operators have been less lucky in this regard and that also applies to us in our CNC-based micro-factory.</p><p>Allowing more people to work remotely opens up many opportunities for businesses. Not only you can bring talent from anywhere in the world, but also you have more choices where to house the hardware allowing to optimise on cost. Furthermore, reaction times can be reduced if travel to the worksite can be eliminated. Quite a few IT professionals have been doing a good job from spectacular locations and we should strive to let more people experience that.</p><p>Another important aspect of structuring work such that it can be done remotely is that it is the first step to automating it. Local to remote, and remote to autonomous allows for a smoother transition than local to autonomous straight away. In the future, we plan on coupling our remote system to AI so if you’re interested, make sure to follow us on LinkedIn or Facebook!</p><p><strong>WARNING! </strong>Running machinery unsupervised is dangerous and must be avoided. This article is elaborating on how to operate machines more efficiently with more staff working remote, but does not suggest running machines without supervision or people on-site.</p><h2 id="how-corona-showed-us-an-opportunity"><strong>How Corona showed us an opportunity</strong></h2><p>Before the COVID-19 hit our workflow for a CNC job has been as follows:</p><ol><li>Make CAD/ CAM in the office;</li><li>Finalise CAM in the shop;</li><li>Run CNC jobs in the shop.</li></ol><p>However, during the quarantine at times it has become difficult to proceed this way because of the travel restrictions ( our CNC lab and office are based in different districts and district travel is cumbersome during quarantine ). We took up this challenge and used it as an opportunity to do the first step towards our micro-factory automation by doing more of the shop work remotely.</p><h2 id="the-cnc-lab-problem"><strong>The CNC lab problem</strong></h2><p>Running a CNC job required:</p><ol><li>Prepare the CAD/CAM files;</li><li>Setup the CNC machine for the job;</li><li>Loop: place the material, run the program, take out the cut parts, clean the table</li></ol><p>In our team, a single person has been doing all of these things. However, is it wise to use a skilled designer/ operator to be in charge of moving material and parts? Not really, because those skills could be invested in something with a much better return on investment (ROI).</p><p>Why don’t we have an unskilled person doing that work? Because CNC jobs are prone to small and costly mistakes, so to ensure high quality and safe operation, that person has to have some skills. Those skills need to either be brought in or be taught and as soon as a person has those skills we are back at having a skilled person doing a large amount of unskilled work.</p><h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3><p>Our first step towards a solution was finding an unskilled person to be at the shop while we remote into the PC which controls the CNC machine. This has greatly improved our ROI and created a truly win-win situation because not only we are more efficiently using our time resources, but also created a new job position.</p><p>Still, there were issues to be solved. Coordination was done by phone and in order to operate the machine safely, we had to do multiple repeated questions making sure that it is safe to run the machine. Setup was particularly tricky because misunderstandings led to tool breakage and material waste. Lastly, making sure that the operation is proceeding smoothly was tricky as well since it required experienced evaluation and experience we did not have on-site.</p><h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3><p>Having drawn conclusions from iteration 1, we’ve decided to upgrade the CNC lab with a camera for more efficient and higher quality feedback. And it is surprising how much easier work became then!</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ukzIoHs74MRrQd9Xu3ZBJQ.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 1. CNC shop&nbsp;camera</figcaption></figure><p>Much less coordination was required and we were much more confident operating the CNC machine knowing that the site was safe for operation. Setups became easier because we could verify that the right measurements were made.</p><p>Soon enough we’ve found many things that could be improved:</p><ul><li>Running cameras in one window and remoting in on another tended to be inconvenient on a single screen workstation;</li><li>Although monitoring was much better, the single-camera setup did not allow to evaluate the quality of the finish or how smoothly the work was progressing;</li><li>When we were executing tool adjustments (eg. changing a bit in the tool chuck ) it was still hard to be sure that the right tool was where it needed to be;</li><li>It has become very apparent that some of the tasks could be semi-automated using feedback from the on-site worker. For example, at the beginning of each session, the machine needs to be initialised by moving it to reference and calibrating all the tools which involved checking if the site was clear for action and then going through a sequence of clicks;</li><li>Measurements still took a while to explain and then took a while to do properly.</li></ul><h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3><p>Taking into account the inefficiencies we’ve identified, we’ve decided to work on a cohesive platform with an intuitive dashboard which would merge all the systems we have and provide the base for automation to be built upon.</p><p>First, was the network setup. We needed to merge multi-site networks into a mesh topology network where all the nodes could be interconnected which was solved using a hub and spoke topology VPN. Although, it does have its own drawbacks it had a good cost-benefit ratio when it comes to setup and deployment and is working for us for now.</p><p>Next, was building the dashboard which not only required the making of the UI but required figuring out how we’re going to expose and manage resources in our shop network. We decided to build the backend in the spirit of Kubernetes, so it is easy to manage at scale with the addition of new sensors, machines and full-blown sites themselves.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JYyqKIXsBTgfg8A-ENR-xw.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2. CNC shop dashboard prototype</figcaption></figure><p>For the GUI we choose to go with Python’s Tkinter package in order to be able to rapidly iterate and once it reaches a stable state we’re planning to move it into a web app for easy access from any device.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>2021-02-07</p><p>last updated 2021-02-19</p></div><p>This is part 1 on the <em>Writing our own Cheat Engine</em> series:</p><ul><li>Part 1: Introduction</li><li><a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/woce-2">Part 2: Exact Value scanning</a></li><li><a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/woce-3">Part 3: Unknown initial value</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://cheatengine.org/">Cheat Engine</a> is a tool designed to modify single player games and contains other useful tools within itself that enable its users to debug games or other applications. It comes with a memory scanner, (dis)assembler, inspection tools and a handful other things. In this series, we will be writing our own tiny Cheat Engine capable of solving all steps of the tutorial, and diving into how it all works underneath.</p><p>Needless to say, we're doing this for private and educational purposes only. One has to make sure to not violate the EULA or ToS of the specific application we're attaching to. This series, much like cheatengine.org, does not condone the illegal use of the code shared.</p><p>Cheat Engine is a tool for Windows, so we will be developing for Windows as well. However, you can also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/12977179/4759433">read memory from Linux-like systems</a>. <a href="https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem">GameConqueror</a> is a popular alternative to Cheat Engine on Linux systems, so if you feel adventurous, you could definitely follow along too! The techniques shown in this series apply regardless of how we read memory from a process. You will learn a fair bit about doing FFI in Rust too.</p><p>We will be developing the application in Rust, because it enables us to interface with the Windows API easily, is memory safe (as long as we're careful with <code>unsafe</code>!), and is speedy (we will need this for later steps in the Cheat Engine tutorial). You could use any language of your choice though. For example, <a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/ctypes-and-windows/">Python also makes it relatively easy to use the Windows API</a>. You don't need to be a Rust expert to follow along, but this series assumes some familiarity with C-family languages. Slightly advanced concepts like the use of <code>unsafe</code> or the <code>MaybeUninit</code> type will be briefly explained. What a <code>fn</code> is or what <code>let</code> does will not be explained.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/">Cheat Engine's source code</a> is mostly written in Pascal and C. And it's <em>a lot</em> of code, with a very flat project structure, and files ranging in the thousand lines of code each. It's daunting<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. It's a mature project, with a lot of knowledge encoded in the code base, and a lot of features like distributed scanning or an entire disassembler. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of comments. For these reasons, I'll do some guesswork when possible as to how it's working underneath, rather than actually digging into what Cheat Engine is actually doing.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p><h2 id="welcome-to-the-cheat-engine-tutorial">Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial</h2><details open=""><summary>Cheat Engine Tutorial: Step 1</summary> <blockquote><p>This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games. It will also show you foundational aspects of using Cheat Engine (or CE for short). Follow the steps below to get started.</p><ol><li>Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.</li><li>Click on the "Open Process" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below "File".).</li><li>With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like &gt; "00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe" or "0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)</li><li>Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the "Open" button. (Don't worry about all the &gt; other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)</li></ol><p>Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the &gt; tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).</p><p>Click the "Next" button below to continue, or fill in the password and click the "OK" button to proceed to that step.)</p><p>If you're having problems, simply head over to forum.cheatengine.org, then click on "Tutorials" to view beginner-friendly &gt; guides!</p></blockquote></details><h2 id="enumerating-processes">Enumerating processes</h2><p>Our first step is attaching to the process we want to work with. But we need a way to find that process in the first place! Having to open the task manager, look for the process we care about, noting down the process ID (PID), and slapping it in the source code is not satisfying at all. Instead, let's enumerate all the processes from within the program, and let the user select one by typing its name.</p><p>From a quick <a href="https://ddg.gg/winapi%20enumerate%20all%20processes">DuckDuckGo search</a>, we find an official tutorial for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/psapi/enumerating-all-processes">Enumerating All Processes</a>, which leads to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> call. Cool! Let's slap in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/winapi"><code>winapi</code></a> crate on <code>Cargo.toml</code>, because I don't want to write all the definitions by myself:</p><pre><code data-lang="toml">[dependencies]
winapi = { version = "0.3.9", features = ["psapi"] }
</code></pre><p>Because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> is in <code>Psapi.h</code> (you can see this in the online page of its documentation), we know we'll need the <code>psapi</code> crate feature. Another option is to search for it in the <a href="https://docs.rs/winapi/"><code>winapi</code> documentation</a> and noting down the parent module where its stored.</p><p>The documentation for the method has the following remark:</p><blockquote><p>It is a good idea to use a large array, because it is hard to predict how many processes there will be at the time you call <strong>EnumProcesses</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Sidenote: reading the documentation for the methods we'll use from the Windows API is extremely important. There's a lot of gotchas involved, so we need to make sure we're extra careful.</em></p><p>1024 is a pretty big number, so let's go with that:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">use std::io;
use std::mem;
use winapi::shared::minwindef::{DWORD, FALSE};

pub fn enum_proc() -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt; {
    let mut pids = Vec::&lt;DWORD&gt;::with_capacity(1024);
    let mut size = 0;
    // SAFETY: the pointer is valid and the size matches the capacity.
    if unsafe {
        winapi::um::psapi::EnumProcesses(
            pids.as_mut_ptr(),
            (pids.capacity() * mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;()) as u32,
            &amp;mut size,
        )
    } == FALSE
    {
        return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
    }

    todo!()
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate enough space<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> for 1024 <code>pids</code> in a vector<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, and pass a mutable pointer to the contents to <code>EnumProcesses</code>. Note that the size of the array is in <em>bytes</em>, not items, so we need to multiply the capacity by the size of <code>DWORD</code>. The API likes to use <code>u32</code> for sizes, unlike Rust which uses <code>usize</code>, so we need a cast.</p><p>Last, we need another mutable variable where the amount of bytes written is stored, <code>size</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror"><code>GetLastError</code></a>.</p></blockquote><p>That's precisely what we do. If it returns false (zero), we return the last OS error. Rust provides us with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.last_os_error"><code>std::io::Error::last_os_error</code></a>, which essentially makes that same call but returns a proper <code>io::Error</code> instance. Cool!</p><blockquote><p>To determine how many processes were enumerated, divide the <em>lpcbNeeded</em> value by <code>sizeof(DWORD)</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Easy enough:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">let count = size as usize / mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;();
// SAFETY: the call succeeded and count equals the right amount of items.
unsafe { pids.set_len(count) };
Ok(pids)
</code></pre><p>Rust doesn't know that the memory for <code>count</code> items were initialized by the call, but we do, so we make use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.set_len"><code>Vec::set_len</code></a> call to indicate this. The Rust documentation even includes a FFI similar to our code!</p><p>Let's give it a ride:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">fn main() {
    dbg!(enum_proc().unwrap().len());
}
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt;cargo run
   Compiling memo v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s
     Running `target\debug\memo.exe`
[src\main.rs:27] enum_proc().unwrap().len() = 178
</code></pre><p>It works! But currently we only have a bunch of process identifiers, with no way of knowing which process they refer to.</p><blockquote><p>To obtain process handles for the processes whose identifiers you have just obtained, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess"><code>OpenProcess</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>Oh!</p><h2 id="opening-a-process">Opening a process</h2><p>The documentation for <code>OpenProcess</code> also contains the following:</p><blockquote><p>When you are finished with the handle, be sure to close it using the <a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/woce-1/closehandle"><code>CloseHandle</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds to me like the perfect time to introduce a custom <code>struct Process</code> with an <code>impl Drop</code>! We're using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup resources, not behaviour, so it's fine. <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-leave-auto-trait-for-reliable-destruction/13825">Using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup behaviour is a bad idea</a>. But anyway, let's get back to the code:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">use std::ptr::NonNull;
use winapi::ctypes::c_void;

pub struct Process {
    pid: u32,
    handle: NonNull&lt;c_void&gt;,
}

impl Process {
    pub fn open(pid: u32) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Self&gt; {
        todo!()
    }
}

impl Drop for Process {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        todo!()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>For <code>open</code>, we'll want to use <code>OpenProcess</code> (and we also need to add the <code>processthreadsapi</code> feature to the <code>winapi</code> dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code>). It returns a <code>HANDLE</code>, which is a nullable mutable pointer to <code>c_void</code>. If it's null, the call failed, and if it's non-null, it succeeded and we have a valid handle. This is why we use Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html"><code>NonNull</code></a>:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">// SAFETY: the call doesn't have dangerous side-effects.
NonNull::new(unsafe { winapi::um::processthreadsapi::OpenProcess(0, FALSE, pid) })
    .map(|handle| Self { pid, handle })
    .ok_or_else(io::Error::last_os_error)
</code></pre><p><code>NonNull</code> will return <code>Some</code> if the pointer is non-null. We map the non-null pointer to a <code>Process</code> instance with <code>Self { .. }</code>. <code>ok_or_else</code> converts the <code>Option</code> to a <code>Result</code> with the error builder function we provide if it was <code>None</code>.</p><p>The first parameter is a bitflag of permissions we want to have. For now, we can leave it as zero (all bits unset, no specific permissions granted). The second one is whether we want to inherit the handle, which we don't, and the third one is the process identifier. Let's close the resource handle on <code>Drop</code> (after adding <code>handleapi</code> to the crate features):</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">// SAFETY: the handle is valid and non-null.
unsafe { winapi::um::handleapi::CloseHandle(self.handle.as_mut()) };
</code></pre><p><code>CloseHandle</code> can actually fail (for example, on double-close), but given our invariants, it won't. You could add an <code>assert!</code> to panic if this is not the case.</p><p>We can now open processes, and they will be automatically closed on <code>Drop</code>. Does any of this work though?</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">fn main() {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 2: Screenshot: <a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png" rel="nofollow">https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png</a></p>
<p>That was me loading duckduckgo in a different container, with brave, while live fetching DNS requests made to the DNS server. I blurred out the non-onion requests. (Different VPN test location than in the above example so 209.x.x.x IP instead of the 104.x.x.x one in the original example.</p>
<hr><h3>EDIT 2: The mods of /r/privacy won't let this be posted. They say:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While we (vastly) prefer the Tor Browser over the Brave one, you'll need a better source than the one you found. Can you find something from a more widely recognized NetSec expert? Something along the lines of Bruce Schneier's blog or something at that level of credibility?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with screenshots is that they can be faked, trivially. There are also a host of approaches that credible writers/reporters do in the NetSec space do before a line of text appears in print. It's this kind of journalism that we have to trust, since we humble Mods don't have the time or resources to vet. So, we'll need something better sourced. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are new posts everyday "warning" people of things that aren't legitimate, hence the caution. This is not a "security" subreddit. A moderator's job is to ensure that the subreddit doesn't devolve into conspiracy theories and misinformation. Security announcements should be vetted and confirmed, not independent claims that the mods have no time to independently verify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can post the steps on how to easily replicate this by using pi-hole on their local networks. Anyone is capable of verifying this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Please do so on r/brave, r/netsec, r/infosec, and other places where this is both directly relevant and appropriate to seek others confirmation. Once vetted by the community (and republished by professionals), you're welcome to post those official responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/r/brave is private, invite only. I posted on netsec and infosec so we'll see. I guess /r/privacy must love Brave and not allow anything against it since it's so god damned easy to verify this...</p>
<p>All you have to do to VERIFY that this is happening is A.) Use Brave B.) Go to an Onion site C.) Observe DNS traffic. Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi or in a Virtual Machine on your desktop and run your DNS requests through it for ease of use and you can verify it. Not sure why they're so hesitant to inform their subscribers of this.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 3: Tested on both a Debian 10 and Ubuntu desktop. I'm not esteemed NetSec researcher and I'm not setting up a 100 different scenarios.</p>

<![CDATA[My attempt on functional programming in PHP]]>
            </title>

February 19, 2021 | https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>PHP was one of my first languages I learned. Even so, this dates back over 10 years, I still use PHP every day at work. However, in the meantime I also learned a lot of other languages like Java, Clojure, Scala, Python, Javascript and Scheme. By learning all the languages and their concepts, the concept of functional programming always was my favorite and so I tried to make my PHP programming style more functional. In the following article you can read some approaches I tried.</p>
<h2 id="functions-as-arguments">Functions as arguments</h2>
<p>Defining a function in PHP is quite easy</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, one of the most common things you do in functional programming is to pass a function as argument to another function. If you try that, PHP will response to you with an error message.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
// PHP Warning:  Use of undefined constant inc
</span></code></pre>
<p>PHP has no direct support for this. To fix the problem we must convert the symbol <code>inc</code> into a string.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map('inc', $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>A more common way is to define a constant for each function and use the constant as parameter to the function.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
const inc = 'inc';

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The disadvantage of such an approach is, that refactoring is more challenging and the chance of missing a constant definition is very high.</p>
<h2 id="class-modules">Class modules</h2>
<p>Another common concept in functional programming it the possibility to group a set of function to a module. A module can have a few public accessible functions and some private functions that are not accessible to the outside world. In PHP this can be accomplished by creating a class using only static members.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyStaticModule {
    private static function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }

    public static function inc($number) {
        return self::add($number, 1);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This approach gives us all the flexibility in terms of modularity. However, the problem of passing functions as arguments for another function hasn't been solved.</p>
<h2 id="trait-modules">Trait modules</h2>
<p>A second approach on modularity is to use traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait MyTraitModule {

    public function inc($number) {
        return $number + 1;
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>After defining all traits you have to create a class that uses these traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyProgram {
    use MyTraitModule;
    // use Other Traits here

    public function main() {
        return $this-&gt;inc($number);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A benefit of this approach is that we can solve our first problem. Therefore, we just need to define the magic method <code>__get</code>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait FPMagic {
    public function __get($name) {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            return [$this, $name]; // This is callable
        } else {
            throw new \Exception('Method does not exists: ' . $name);
        }
    }
}

class MyProgram {
    use FPMagic;
    use MyTraitModule;

    public function main() {
        $x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        return array_map($this-&gt;inc, $x); // Works using the magic method __get
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A big disadvantage of this approach is, that we have to resolve all conflicting function names ourself. Not only for public methods but also for private methods. This becomes next to impossible if the program grows.</p>
<p>A combination of the class module approach and the trait module approach would be a good solution to get started with functional programming in PHP. However, the trick with the magic method <code>_get</code> cannot be used for the class module approach, since PHP has no magic method for static properties.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>One last alternative is to use a language that is functional and compiles to PHP. In recent years, there have been a few attempts on this (e.g. <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> and <a href="http://www.pharen.org/">Pharen</a>). While Pharen looked very promising, it hasn't seen any commits for a few years now and is still based on PHP 5.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-phel">Introducing Phel</h2>
<p>Since I didn't found a good solution for this problem, I used my coronavirus spare time to solve it by myself. This is what turns out to be Phel. Phel is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of Lisp inspired by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a>. While the status of Phel is currently alpha, it is fairly complete. If you want to try it, go ahead and read the <a href="https://phel-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/">Getting started guide</a>. I'm looking for your feedback.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><img alt="Chaos Engineering - How to simulate I/O faults at runtime" src="https://chaos-mesh.org/assets/images/how-to-simulate-io-faults-at-runtime-39daaf89aa83a5be58402f763db0d5c5.jpg"></p><p>In a production environment, filesystem faults might occur due to various incidents such as disk failures and administrator errors. As a Chaos Engineering platform, Chaos Mesh has supported simulating I/O faults in a filesystem ever since its early versions. By simply adding an IOChaos CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), we can watch how the filesystem fails and returns errors.</p><p>However, before Chaos Mesh 1.0, this experiment was not easy and may have consumed a lot of resources. We needed to inject sidecar containers to the Pod through the mutating admission webhooks and rewrite the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. Even if no fault was injected, the injected sidecar container caused a substantial amount of overhead.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 has changed all this. Now, we can use IOChaos to inject faults to a filesystem at runtime. This simplifies the process and greatly reduces system overhead. This blog post introduces how we implement the IOChaos experiment without using a sidecar.</p><h2>I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To simulate I/O faults at runtime, we need to inject faults into a filesystem after the program starts <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system calls</a> (such as reads and writes) but before the call requests arrive at the target filesystem. We can do that in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); however, it <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used to inject delay</a>.</li><li>Add a filesystem layer called ChaosFS before the target filesystem. ChaosFS uses the target filesystem as the backend and receives requests from the operating system. The entire call link is <strong>target program syscall</strong> -&gt; <strong>Linux kernel</strong> -&gt; <strong>ChaosFS</strong> -&gt; <strong>target filesystem</strong>. Because ChaosFS is customizable, we can inject delays and errors as we want. Therefore, ChaosFS is our choice.</li></ul><p>But ChaosFS has several problems:</p><ul><li>If ChaosFS reads and writes files in the target filesystem, we need to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount</a> ChaosFS to a different path than the target path specified in the Pod configuration. ChaosFS <strong>cannot</strong> be mounted to the path of the target directory.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS <strong>before</strong> the target program starts running. This is because the newly-mounted ChaosFS takes effect only on files that are newly opened by the program in the target filesystem.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS to the target containter's <code>mnt</code> namespace. For details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount_namespaces(7) — Linux manual page</a>.</li></ul><p>Before Chaos Mesh 1.0, we used the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutating admission webhook</a> to implement IOChaos. This technique addressed the three problems lists above and allowed us to:</p><ul><li>Run scripts in the target container. This action changed the target directory of the ChaosFS's backend filesystem (for example, from <code>/mnt/a</code> to <code>/mnt/a_bak</code>) so that we could mount ChaosFS to the target path (<code>/mnt/a</code>).
Modify the command that starts the Pod. For example, we could modify the original command <code>/app</code> to <code>/waitfs.sh /app</code>.</li><li>The <code>waitfs.sh</code> script kept checking whether the filesystem was successfully mounted. If it was mounted, <code>/app</code> was started.</li><li>Add a new container in the Pod to run ChaosFS. This container needed to share a volume with the target container (for example, <code>/mnt</code>), and then we mounted this volume to the target directory (for example, <code>/mnt/a</code>). We also properly enabled <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount propagation</a> for this volume's mount to penetrate the share to host and then penetrate slave to the target.</li></ul><p>These three approaches allowed us to inject I/O faults while the program was running. However, the injection was far from convenient:</p><ul><li>We could only inject faults into a volume subdirectory, not into the entire volume. The workaround was to replace <code>mv</code> (rename) with <code>mount move</code> to move the mount point of the target volume.</li><li>We had to explicitly write commands in the Pod rather than implicitly use the image commands. Otherwise, the <code>/waitfs.sh</code> script could not properly start the program after the filesystem was mounted.</li><li>The corresponding container needed to have a proper configuration for mount propagation. Due to potential privacy and security issues, we <strong>could not</strong> modify the configuration via the mutating admission webhook.</li><li>The injection configuration was troublesome. Worse still, we had to create a new Pod after the configuration was able to inject faults.</li><li>We could not withdraw ChaosFS while the program was running. Even if no fault or error was injected, the performance was greatly affected.</li></ul><h2>Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook<a href="#inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>What about cracking these tough nuts without the mutating admission webhook? Let's get back and think a bit about the reason why we used the mutating admission webhook to add a container in which ChaosFS runs. We do that to mount the filesystem to the target container.</p><p>In fact, there is another solution. Instead of adding containers to the Pod, we can first use the <code>setns</code> Linux system call to modify the namespace of the current process and then use the <code>mount</code> call to mount ChaosFS to the target container. Suppose that the filesystem to inject is <code>/mnt</code>. The new injection process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Use <code>setns</code> for the current process to enter the mnt namespace of the target container.</li><li>Execute <code>mount --move</code> to move <code>/mnt</code> to <code>/mnt_bak</code>.</li><li>Mount ChaosFS to <code>/mnt</code> and use <code>/mnt_bak</code> as the backend.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, the target container will open, read, and write the files in <code>/mnt</code> through ChaosFS. In this way, delays or faults are injected much more easily. However, there are still two questions to answer:</p><ul><li>How do you handle the files that are already opened by the target process?</li><li>How do you recover the process given that we cannot unmount the filesystem when files are opened?</li></ul><h3>Dynamically replace file descriptors<a href="#dynamically-replace-file-descriptors" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><strong>ptrace solves both of the two questions above.</strong> We can use ptrace to replace the opened file descriptors (FD) at runtime and replace the current working directory (CWD) and mmap.</p><h4>Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program<a href="#use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ptrace</a> is a powerful tool that makes the target process (tracee) to run any system call or binary program. For a tracee to run the program, ptrace modifies the RIP-pointed address to the target process and adds an <code>int3</code> instruction to trigger a breakpoint. When the binary program stops, we need to restore the registers and memory.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86_64 architecture</a>, the RIP register (also called an instruction pointer) always points to the memory address at which the next directive is run.
To load the program into the target process memory spaces:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use ptrace to call mmap in the target program to allocate the needed memory.</li><li>Write the binary program to the newly allocated memory and make the RIP register point to it.</li><li>After the binary program stops, call munmap to clean up the memory section.</li></ol><p>As a best practice, we often replace ptrace <code>POKE_TEXT</code> writes with <code>process_vm_writev</code> because if there is a huge amount of data to write, <code>process_vm_writev</code> performs more efficiently.</p><p>Using ptrace, we are able to make a process to replace its own FD. Now we only need a method to make that replacement happen. This method is the <code>dup2</code> system call.</p><h4>Use <code>dup2</code> to replace file descriptor<a href="#use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The signature of the <code>dup2</code> function is <code>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</code>. It is used to create a copy of the old FD (<code>oldfd</code>). This copy has an FD number of <code>newfd</code>. If <code>newfd</code> already corresponds to the FD of an opened file, the FD on the file that's already opened is automatically closed.</p><p>For example, the current process opens <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> whose FD is <code>1</code>. To replace this opened file with <code>/var/run/test/a</code>, this process performs the following operations:</p><ol><li>Uses the <code>fcntl</code> system call to get the <code>OFlags</code> (the parameter used by the <code>open</code> system call, such as <code>O_WRONLY</code>) of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>Iseek</code> system call to get the current location of <code>seek</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>open</code> system call to open <code>/var/run/test/a</code> using the same <code>OFlags</code>. Assume that the FD is <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>Iseek</code> to change the <code>seek</code> location of the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>dup2(2, 1)</code> to replace the FD <code>1</code> of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> with the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Closes FD <code>2</code>.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, FD <code>1</code> of the current process points to <code>/var/run/test/a</code>. So that we can inject faults, any subsequent operations on the target file go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE). FUSE is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.</p><h4>Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor<a href="#write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The combined functionality of ptrace and dup2 makes it possible for the tracer to make the tracee replace the opened FD by itself.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might know that I’ve posted funny emails I’ve received on my blog several times in the past. The kind of emails people send me when they experience problems with some device they own (like a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/02/16/why-is-your-email-in-my-car/" data-type="post" data-id="10856">car</a>) and they contact me because my email address happens to be visible somewhere.</p>



<p>People sometimes say I should get a different email address or use another one in the curl license file, but I’ve truly never had a problem with these emails, as they mostly remind me about the tough challenges the modern technical life bring to people and it gives me insights about what things that run curl.</p>



<p>But not all of these emails are “funny”.</p>



<h2>Category: not funny</h2>



<p>Today I received the following email</p>



<pre>From: Al Nocai &lt;[redacted]@icloud.com&gt;
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:02:24 -0600
Subject: I will slaughter you</pre>



<p>That subject.</p>



<p>As an open source maintainer since over twenty years, I know flame wars and personal attacks and I have a fairly thick skin and I don’t let words get to me easily. It took me a minute to absorb and realize it was actually meant as a direct physical threat. It found its ways through and got to me. This level of aggressiveness is not what I’m prepared for.</p>



<p>Attached in this email, there were seven images and no text at all. The images all look like screenshots from a phone and the first one is clearly showing <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/include/curl/multi.h">source code I wrote</a> and my copyright line:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png"><img loading="lazy" width="295" height="640" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/al/">other images</a> showed other source code and related build/software info of other components, but I couldn’t spot how they were associated with me in any way.</p>



<p>No explanation, just that subject and the seven images and I was left to draw my own conclusions.</p>



<p>I presume the name in the email is made up and the email account is probably a throw-away one. The time zone used in the <code>Date:</code> string might imply US <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cst">central standard time</a> but could of course easily be phony as well. </p>



<h2>How I responded</h2>



<p>Normally I don’t respond to these confused emails because the distance between me and the person writing them is usually almost interplanetary. This time though, it was so far beyond what’s acceptable to me and in any decent society I couldn’t just let it slide. After I took a little pause and walked around my house for a few minutes to cool off, I wrote a really angry reply and sent it off.</p>



<blockquote><p>This was a totally and completely utterly unacceptable email and it hurt me deep in my soul. You should be ashamed and seriously reconsider your manners.</p><p>I have no idea what your screenshots are supposed to show, but clearly something somewhere is using code I wrote. Code I have written runs in virtually every Internet connected device on the planet and in most cases the users download and use it without even telling me, for free.</p><p>Clearly you don’t deserve my code.</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t expect that it will be read or make any difference.</p>



<p>Update below, added after my initial post.</p>



<h2>Al Nocai’s response</h2>



<p>Contrary to my expectations above, he responded. It’s not even worth commenting but for transparency I’ll include it here.</p>



<p><em>I do not care. Your bullshit software was an attack vector that cost me a multimillion dollar defense project.</em></p>



<p><em>Your bullshit software has been used to root me and multiple others. I lost over $15k in prototyping alone from bullshit rooting to the charge arbitrators.</em></p>



<p><em>I have now since October been sandboxed because of your bullshit software so dipshit google kids could grift me trying to get out of the sandbox because they are too piss poor to know shat they are doing.</em></p>



<p><em>You know what I did to deserve that? I tried to develop a trade route in tech and establish project based learning methodologies to make sure kids aren’t left behind. You know who is all over those god damn files? You are. Its sickening. I got breached in Oct 2020 through federal server hijacking, and I owe a great amount of that to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Ive had to sit and watch as i reported:</em></p>



<ol><li><em>fireeye Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Solarwinds Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Zyxel Modem Breach Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Multiple Sigover attack vectors utilizing favicon XML injection</em></li><li><em>JS Stochastic templating utilizing comparison expressions to write to data registers</em></li><li><em>Get strong armed by $50billion companies because i exposed bullshit malware</em></li></ol>



<p><em>And i was rooted and had my important correspondence all rerouted as some sick fuck dismantled my life with the code you have your name plastered all over. I cant even leave the country because of the situation; qas you have so effectively built a code base to shit all over people, I dont give a shit how you feel about this.</em></p>



<p><em>You built a formula 1 race car and tossed the keys to kids with ego problems. Now i have to deal with Win10 0-days because this garbage.</em></p>



<p><em>I lost my family, my country my friends, my home and 6 years of work trying to build a better place for posterity. And it has beginnings in that code. That code is used to root and exploit people. That code is used to blackmail people.</em></p>



<p><em>So no, I don’t feel bad one bit. You knew exactly the utility of what you were building. And you thought it was all a big joke. Im not laughing. I am so far past that point now.</em></p>



<p><em>/- Al</em></p>



<h2>Al continues</h2>



<p>Nine hours after I first published this blog post , Al replied again with two additional emails. His third and forth emails to me.</p>



<h3>Email 3:</h3>



<p><em><a href="https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/">https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/</a><br>Step up. You arent scaring me. What led me here? The 5th violent attempt on my life. Apple terms of service? gtfo, thanks for the platform.</em></p>



<p>Amusingly he has found a blog post about my blog post.</p>



<h3>Email 4:</h3>



<p><em>There is the project: MOUT Ops Risk Analysis through Wide Band Em Spectrum analysis through different fourier transforms.<br>You and whoever the fuck david dick rider is, you are a part of this.<br>Federal server breaches-<br>Accomplice to attempted murder-<br>Fraud-<br>just a few.</em></p>



<p><em>I have talked to now: FBI FBI Regional, VA, VA OIG, FCC, SEC, NSA, DOH, GSA, DOI, CIA, CFPB, HUD, MS, Convercent, as of today 22 separate local law enforcement agencies calling my ass up and wasting my time.</em></p>



<p><em>You and dick ridin’ dave are respinsible. I dont give a shit, call the cops. I cuss them out wheb they call and they all go silent.</em></p>



<p>I’ve kept his peculiar formatting and typos. In email 4 there was also a PDF file attached named <code>BustyBabes 4.pdf</code>. It is apparently a 13 page document about the “NERVEBUS NERVOUS SYSTEM” described in the first paragraph as “NerveBus Nervous System aims to be a general utility platform that provides comprehensive and complex analysis to provide the end user with cohesive, coherent and “real-time” information about the environment it monitors.”. There’s no mention of curl or my name in the document.</p>



<p>Since I don’t know the status of this document I will not share it publicly, but here’s a screenshot of the front page:</p>

<p>This is an implementation of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05507">Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling</a>
in <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>.</p>
<p>This is an extension of <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/xl/index.html">Transformer XL</a> where past memories
are compressed to give a longer attention range.
That is, the furthest $n_{cm} c$ memories are compressed into
$n_{cm}$ memories, where $c$ is the compression rate.</p>
<h2>Compression operation</h2>
<p>The compression operation is defined as
$f_c: \mathbb{R}^{nc \times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.
The paper introduces multiple choices for $f_c$ and we have only implemented
1D convolution which seems to give the best results.
Each layer has a separate compression operation $f_c^{(i)}$ where
$i$ is the layer number.</p>
<h2>Training compression operation</h2>
<p>Since training compression with BPTT requires maintaining
a very large computational graph (many time steps), the paper proposes
an <em>auto-encoding loss</em> and an <em>attention reconstruction loss</em>.
The auto-encoding loss decodes the original memories from the compressed memories
and calculates the loss.
Attention reconstruction loss computes the multi-headed attention results
on the compressed memory and on uncompressed memory and gets a mean squared error
between them.
We have implemented the latter here since it gives better results.</p>
<p>This implementation uses pre-layer normalization
while the paper uses post-layer normalization.
Pre-layer norm does the layer norm before FFN[../feedforward.html) and
self-attention, and the pass-through in the residual connection is not normalized.
This is supposed to be more stable in standard transformer setups.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/compressive/experiment.html">the training code</a> and a notebook for training a compressive transformer
model on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.</p>
<p>It was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.</p>

And the best thing about it? You wouldn’t need to force yourself to work.</p><p>There are people exactly like that who sit down and work without pushing themselves to do it. They even look forward to working. The good news is that you can learn to do it too.</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p>Most people have a negative mindset about work. People see work as an annoyance that keeps them from doing whatever they really want to do. They also think that resting and having nothing to do is an ideal state they’d like to be in forever. This leads to thinking that you need to push yourself to work. You need to use willpower to get yourself to do it.</p><p>It’s simple to understand where this attitude comes from:</p><ol><li>People usually want things they don’t have and think that grass is greener on the other side.</li><li>Everyone talks about how work is hard.</li><li>In comparison to dead-end or corporate jobs without impact or freedom, neverending leisure looks like paradise.</li></ol><p>In reality, most people who try to be in this nothing-to-do state for a long time become unhappy, depressed, and bored. Rich people who “made it” report how soon they become restless again.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/">People who game all the time</a>&nbsp;realize how empty it feels. Too much leisure isn’t satisfying for long.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a certain group of people who work a lot and enjoy it. Let’s call this group&nbsp;<em>producers</em>. By this, we don’t mean workaholics who escape from their whole life by working all the time. Producers have a healthy work-life balance. So what do they do that people who hate work don’t?</p><p>First, they tend to think about work differently.</p><p>For them, work is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/what-is-a-positive-feedback-loop-and-why-it-matters">a virtuous cycle of positive feedback loops</a>. Producers see&nbsp;<strong>work as a source of meaning and satisfaction</strong>. They see work as something that allows them to savor deserved leisure. They see rest as something that increases their life happiness and fuels their motivation towards work.</p><p>Second, their work is usually:</p><ul><li>Interesting</li><li>Meaningful</li><li>Well-defined</li></ul><p>If you check at least 1 or 2 boxes somehow, something magical happens:</p><p><strong>You don’t have to push yourself towards work anymore.</strong></p><p>Well-defined, meaningful, and especially interesting work is easy to look forward to.</p><p>Non-producers often think that these producers are lucky because they stumbled upon work like this. In reality, producers often go a long way to make their work fun.</p><h2>How to make work more interesting</h2><p>This is the crucial factor in whether work gets done.</p><p>You don’t have to see any meaning in your work for it to be interesting.</p><p>Even if the task is totally undefined, complex, and difficult, curiosity can carry you to its completion.</p><p>So how can you develop this curiosity towards work?</p><p>You have to give the work a chance to become interesting. How? By combining these 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Have less exposure towards super fun things</h3><p>Video games, surfing the internet, porn, alcohol, and drugs etc. make work significantly more difficult. Why?</p><p>They establish a certain standard of mental stimulation. Anything that’s not super fun will seem boring.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_standard.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="We develop a Stimulation Standard"></p><p>Unfortunately, work often falls in the “feels bad” category. In comparison to games or social media, work can feel uninteresting or annoying.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_distractions.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from distractions to work is hard"></p><p>You might argue that there are people who work just fine even while drinking alcohol, playing video games etc.</p><p>However, consider that there are two types of people: ones who can moderate their consumption and others who can’t. The latter society often describes as addicts.</p><p>Basically, if you’re addicted to any of the high-dopamine, low-effort activity, please quit it. At least temporarily so you can reestablish a healthy relationship to work. The more experienced we’re about the topic, the more obvious this is. There is no other way than to temporarily quit the addiction. If your vice is gaming, we’ve covered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/should-i-quit-video-games">video gaming addiction here</a>.</p><p>Some can have a healthy relationship with, for example, gaming.</p><p>However, for some people gaming is kryptonite. Here are some signs that super-fun activities have a detrimental effect on your work:</p><ol><li>You rush and half-ass everything else in order to get to your super-fun activity.         When I (Mat) was addicted to gaming, everything during the day was half-assed so I could finally start playing.</li><li>You keep postponing or forgetting everything that isn’t urgent in order to get to your super fun activity. You have this book that you want to read but you never get to actually reading it.</li><li>Your orderliness suffers once you start with the super fun activity.        Most people who come back to gaming report how their sense of orderliness starts to depreciate rather quickly. Their room gets messy, they start skipping workouts, stop meal-prepping, start eating more junk food, stop organizing their days.</li></ol><p>If the points above describe you, it might be time to quit your super fun activity. At least for a while.</p><p>Once your brain is not constantly hyper-stimulated, it’s easier to find mundane activities like work or tidying more interesting.</p><h3>2. Get bored more often</h3><p>When you get bored, everything else becomes more interesting.</p><p>Don’t believe us? Try this little experiment. Turn everything off. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Sit on a chair and stare at a wall. Don’t move. Don’t consume any information. Don’t talk. Don’t write anything down. Just stare at the wall.</p><p>Except for zen masters, most of us will become restless after a few minutes. Often, our brain starts dreaming and imagining things. For the first few minutes, you might feel alright, thinking about your day. However, after 5 or 10 minutes, you’ll be itching to do something, anything really. Suddenly, creating a website, writing an article, or drawing a picture sounds like more interesting, more fun.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_boredom.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from boredom to work is easier"></p><p>If you feel like you never stop scrolling and consume content all the time, schedule a 15 minute boredom window for tomorrow right before you want to start working.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-use-boredom-to-procrastinate-less">Use boredom strategically.</a></p><h3>3. Dive deep into a topic</h3><p>It’s fun when we can connect the dots. When we can draw new connections between ideas, we get a rush.&nbsp;<em>Oh, I can see how this historical event contributed to an uprising…</em></p><p>The more connections we can draw within a topic, the more interested we become. This is what curiosity is all about.</p><p>If you take the time to watch a documentary related to what you’re working on, read a book about it, or find a couple relevant articles. You’ll collect more dots to connect. You’ll see how everything fits together.</p><p>When you do feel like watching something or have a free evening, instead of watching random videos or reruns of old TV shows, steer your attention to something related to what you need to do.</p><p>Give yourself time to develop an interest.</p><h2>How to make work more meaningful</h2><p>It's hard to feel motivated when you don't have a personal reason to do something.</p><p>However, “meaningful work” has become something of a buzzword.</p><p>Everyone is trying to find meaning in their work. This can be wasted energy, especially if you work in a corporate or a dead-end job. We say this so you don’t dwell on it and don’t feel frustrated because you can’t figure out how to save the world by doing what you do.</p><p>In any case, whatever your work is, you can make it meaningful enough to start.</p><p>Let’s say you have to study for an exam. You don’t find this particular class enjoyable. If you remind yourself why you chose to take the class and why studying is important for you, you will have an easier time persuading yourself to push through.</p><p>The fact is that some things simply need to be done. It's better if you find a compelling and personal reason to do them and get them over with as soon as possible, instead of putting them off forever.</p><p>When something is boring, ask yourself: Why do I need to do this? Find and reinforce the why behind the work.</p><h2>How to make work well-defined</h2><p>If you have a recipe that tells you step-by-step how to cook a meal, it is usually quite easy to follow. You know exactly where to start and how.</p><p>In today’s creative work, this often isn’t the case. There are no recipes for the work we need to do, or they don’t make the work any easier because the recipe would be too complex to understand.</p><p>Additionally, we often hamper our enthusiasm towards work by ourselves. How often do you find yourself with vague and unhelpful to-dos like “write the essay” or “make a video.”</p><p>There are so many steps in “make a video” that this vague task definition only causes anxiety and procrastination.</p><p>We always say that it’s more difficult to start working than to keep working. Therefore we should make starting easier by defining well&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to begin and&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;to begin with.</p><p>The better you can define how to start working, the easier it’ll be to actually do it.</p><p>Basically, you do this in 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Always define exactly where you’ll start</h3><p>This means you write down the next physical action to take.</p><p>Do you need to write an essay?</p><p>The next physical action is: Open the scientific study and start reading</p><p>Or: Create a document → Create a rough draft in the next 15 minutes</p><p>Do you want to start learning coding?</p><p>The next physical action should be: Open freecodecamp.org → Start solving the first challenge</p><p>It might sound silly to define the next physical action, but it isn’t. Finding it is easy, and you can do it immediately.</p><p>What’s the next physical action you need to take?</p><h3>2. Start with only having to work for 5/15 minutes</h3><p>You probably don't feel like creating a 20 slide presentation right now from scratch, and then presenting it in 2 hours.</p><p>You don't feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know.</p><p>You don't feel like running a marathon.</p><p>But you might feel like looking up a couple pictures or articles for the presentation.</p><p>Or feel like writing a paragraph or two before lunch break.</p><p>Or feel like taking a 1km walk.</p><p>Those are the small steps along the longer journey.</p><p>We often underestimate the power of small steps, but they are essential because they help us get into the right routine.</p><p>If you start running a couple miles every other day, you'll get familiar with the routine and then you'll naturally want to start increasing the …</p></article></div>

In einer Studie hat nun der Nanowissenschaftler Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger den Ursprung des Virus beleuchtet. Er kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass sowohl die Zahl als auch die Qualität der Indizien für einen Laborunfall am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan als Ursache der gegenwärtigen Pandemie sprechen.</p><p>Die Studie wurde im Zeitraum von Januar 2020 bis Dezember 2020 durchgeführt. Sie basiert auf einem interdisziplinären wissenschaftlichen Ansatz sowie auf einer umfangreichen Recherche unter Nutzung verschiedenster Informationsquellen. Hierzu gehören unter anderem wissenschaftliche Literatur, Artikel in Print- und Online-Medien sowie persönliche Kommunikation mit internationalen Kolleginnen und Kollegen. Sie liefert keine hochwissenschaftlichen Beweise, wohl aber zahlreiche und schwerwiegende Indizien:</p>
<ul>
<li>Im Gegensatz zu früheren Coronaviren-bedingten Epidemien wie SARS und MERS konnte bis heute, d. h. weit über ein Jahr nach Ausbruch der gegenwärtigen Pandemie, kein Zwischenwirtstier identifiziert werden, welches die Übertragung von SARS-CoV-2-Erregern von Fledermäusen auf den Menschen ermöglicht haben könnte. Die Zoonose-Theorie als mögliche Erklärung für die Pandemie besitzt daher keine fundierte wissenschaftliche Grundlage.</li>
<li>Die SARS-CoV-2-Viren können erstaunlich gut an menschliche Zellrezeptoren ankoppeln und in menschliche Zellen eindringen. Ermöglicht wird dies durch spezielle Zellrezeptor-Bindungsdomänen verbunden mit einer speziellen (Furin-)Spaltstelle des Coronavirus-Zacken-Proteins. Beide Eigenschaften zusammen waren bislang bei Coronaviren nicht bekannt und weisen auf einen nicht-natürlichen Ursprung des SARS-CoV-2-Erregers hin.</li>
<li>Fledermäuse wurden nicht auf dem in Verdacht geratenen Fischmarkt im Zentrum der Stadt Wuhan angeboten. Im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan gibt es jedoch eine der weltweit größten Sammlungen von Fledermauserregern, welche von weit entfernten Höhlen in südchinesischen Provinzen stammen. Es ist extrem unwahrscheinlich, dass sich Fledermäuse aus dieser Entfernung von nahezu 2.000 km auf natürliche Weise auf den Weg nach Wuhan begeben haben, um dann in unmittelbarer Nähe dieses virologischen Instituts eine weltweite Pandemie auszulösen.</li>
<li>Eine Forschungsgruppe am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan hat über viele Jahre hinweg gentechnische Manipulationen an Coronaviren vorgenommen mit dem Ziel, diese für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher zu machen. Dies ist in der wissenschaftlichen Fachliteratur durch zahlreiche Publikationen belegt.</li>
<li>Es existierten erhebliche Sicherheitsmängel im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan bereits vor Ausbruch der Coronavirus-Pandemie, welche dokumentiert sind.</li>
<li>Es gibt zahlreiche direkte Hinweise auf einen Laborursprung des SARS-CoV-2 Erregers. So soll sich eine junge Wissenschaftlerin des virologischen Instituts in Wuhan als erste infiziert haben. Es gibt ferner zahlreiche Hinweise darauf, dass sich bereits im Oktober 2019 der SARS-CoV-2 Erreger ausgehend von dem virologischen Institut in der Stadt Wuhan und darüber hinaus verbreitet hat. Ferner gibt es Hinweise auf eine entsprechende Untersuchung des virologischen Instituts durch die chinesischen Behörden in der ersten Oktoberhälfte 2019.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;„Die gegenwärtige Coronavirus-Pandemie beherrscht nicht nur die derzeitigen Schlagzeilen, sondern wird uns noch über viele Jahre hinweg beschäftigen – nicht zuletzt aufgrund der sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen. Seit Monaten steht verständlicherweise der Umgang mit und die Bewältigung von der Corona-Krise im Vordergrund der Themen in der Politik und in den Medien. Von großer Bedeutung ist jedoch schon heute die kritische wissenschaftsbasierte Auseinandersetzung mit der Frage nach dem Ursprung der derzeitigen Pandemie, denn nur auf Basis dieses Wissens können adäquate Vorkehrungen getroffen werden, die Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Auftreten ähnlicher Pandemien in Zukunft so klein wie möglich zu halten“, sagt Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger.</p>
<p>Die Studie wurde im Januar 2021 fertiggestellt und zunächst in Wissenschaftskreisen verteilt und diskutiert. Mit der Veröffentlichung soll nun eine breit angelegte Diskussion angeregt werden, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die ethischen Aspekte der sogenannten „gain-of-function“-Forschung, welche Krankheitserreger für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher macht. „Dies kann nicht länger nur Angelegenheit einer kleinen Gruppe von Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern bleiben, sondern muss dringend Gegenstand einer öffentlichen Debatte werden“, so der Autor der Studie.&nbsp;</p>

					<div>
					<h2>
					I made a PRORES-lookalike for Windows
					</h2>



					
					
					<h2>Preface – What is PRORES?
					</h2>
					<p>
PRORES is a line of intermediate codecs, which means they are intended for use during video editing, and not for practical end-user viewing. It’s been developed by Apple, back in 2007 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProRes" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
</p>


					<h2>Why did I do it?
					</h2>
					<div><p>
There have been several reasons, but it all boils down to: I got very frustrated with the implementation of the Windows decoders when dealing with .mp4 (h264 and h265 codecs) – which are pretty much 98% of all videos out there.<br>

Since I’m actually developing a <a href="https://cinematicstudio.app/" target="_blank">video editor</a>, when it comes to loading video frames in memory, you can:<br>
1. use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer?view=winrt-19041" target="_blank">MediaPlayer</a> class, from Microsoft<br>
2. use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a></p><p>


MediaPlayer is unreliable and slow <a href="#n1">[1]</a>. And, wait for it, it has Video RAM memory leaks <a href="#n2">[2]</a>.<br>

Using ffmpeg: Most advice on the internet – whether you can use ffmpeg in a commercial app or not – ends with “but I’m not a lawyer”. I chose to avoid it, at least at the beginning <a href="#n3">[3]</a>. </p><p>

I initially went with using MediaPlayer. This frustrated me (and a lot of my users) a lot, making my app close to impossible to use in certain scenarios. Like, what if I want to play a video backwards, at 3x speed? What I’d do is cache that specific video segment ahead of time – which not only did take a lot of RAM, but it also made my app show the “Loading” icon when you would press Play – until I would pre-load all such segments.</p><p>

At some point I painfully realized: if I don’t do something similar to PRORES, I’m screwed. Clearly, the first idea was – what if I could use the codecs from Apple? Spoiler alert: you can’t. <br>

So, what else could I do? Develop my own!

</p></div>





					<h2>Lets see the numbers!
					</h2>
					<div><p>
Well, I can’t say it was easy to develop this. I had to get creative quite a few times. But once I realized there’s really no way around it, I stuck with it. And I’ve created some limitations, just to make sure frames will load up insanely fast.</p><p>

When you hit Play, the video project will strive to play at 60 frames / second – even if your video project is 30 fps or something else. </p><p>

What this basically means, I have 16.66 milliseconds to load everything that’s needed (which if you have several video layers, means loading several video frames) and apply video effects on top of that. And, play the sound, of course.</p><p>

We can relax this requirement a bit, because even if the video project would play at 30 frames / second, it would still look smooth to you. So, I have 33.33 milliseconds tops to load all needed video frames and apply video effects on top of that.</p><p>

Applying video effects, such as blur, directional blur, masking, lighting takes an insane amount of time. By doing a lot of trial and error, I chose to do it like this – I will show the video at 640 x 360 (no, it’s not as low res as you may think <a href="#n4">[4]</a>). This will make frame loading very fast, and the video effects will be fast as well. I will improve upon this <a href="#n5">[5]</a>.</p><p>

Complicated video effects can take up to 5ms on a decent GPU. They take slightly longer on older GPUs, but it’s still decent. It can take up to 9ms on an Nvidia Quadro M600M with 2GB of RAM (a 5-year old video card). Compounding video effects (several effects on top of each other) will be a bit harder <a href="#n6">[6]</a>.</p><p>

This still leaves us with 24.33 milliseconds to load video frames. In my tests, I load one video frame in 2ms on an Nvidia Geforce RTX 2070, and 3.45ms on Nvidia Quadro M600M. So, worst case scenario, I could still load 6-7 video frames in time for drawing them on-screen.</p><p>

One thing to note is that you will need a decent SSD for this to happen. Or, do a “sacrifice play” – basically hit Play, and this will be a bit slower the first time, so that Windows will be able to cache the video files in memory.
					
</p></div>


					<h2>Creating the PRORES-lookalike files
					</h2>
					<div><p>
When you import a video file, I will automatically create the PRORES-lookalike file. There’s no point in using MediaPlayer until the PRORES-lookalike is complete – it would drain further resources (Memory + CPU + GPU) with very little gains.</p><p>

One thing I do, while creating the PRORES-lookalike, I will keep in memory the first 3.5 minutes of the video, thus, you can still have a decent preview in real-time while I’m doing this.</p><p>

To give you the numbers, it’s not something set in stone, it depends on the video I’m converting. It will range between 15-18 times faster than duration of the video on my Geforce RTX 2070 card. So for instance, it takes roughly 3:20 minutes to process a 1 hour video.</p></div>


					<h2>Behind the scenes
					</h2>
					<p>
What I’m doing is something remarkably simple, and after running a lot of tests, I realized it’s enough, at least for now. It’s similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG" target="_blank">Motion JPEG</a>, with the difference that I’m in control 100%. In other words, I always get to decide when each video frame is loaded and how long it stays in memory.					
</p>


					<h2>Is this battle tested?
					</h2>
					<p>
Yes! I’ve had this in production since late September 2020. I’ve done a few tweaks along the way, but the core code is the same.</p>


					<h2>How does it compare with ffmpeg?
					</h2>
					<p>
My take is that it’s 6-10 times faster. I’ve looked into it in the last few days, but I can’t do a proper test just yet. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/unosquare/ffmediaelement" target="_blank">FFMediaElement library</a> to do some testing, but I can’t get it to use GPU (I did ask in the forum, will publish the results once I have them). At this time, for a 4K video, my results indicate processing a video frame takes 77ms on the CPU on my machine with the Geforce video card. I assume the GPU should be 5-7 times faster, thus it would likely take somewhere between 11-15ms, compared to 2ms for me.
</p>

					<h2>How does it compare with Apple PRORES?
					</h2>
					<div><p>
Honestly, I don’t know. I would say it should be roughly on-par, since I’m pretty sure the underlying concepts should be similar. It may be that Apple might generate the PRORES files faster, I’m not sure. But accessing them, I would say we should see similar times.</p><p>

If anyone wants to test this – you’d need a machine with both MacOS and Windows 10 – , drop me an email at <a href="mailto:cinematic@cinematicstudio.com">cinematic@cinematicstudio.com</a> I can easily allow turning on statistics that would show you the average video frame loading time.</p><p>

					<h2>Notes
					</h2>
					<div>
<p>[1] For one thing, when you seek to a frame, you’re not entirely sure you’ve actually gotten there, in <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> event – because of how they internally do caching. So even if Microsoft tells you you’re there, well you’re not. To give you an example, say you’re at position 10.5 seconds, and you want to go to position 20.1 seconds. When you receive the first 2-3 <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> events, what you may get is frames at position 10.5 seconds, and at some point, you’ll start receiving frames at position 20.1 seconds. </p><p>

In practice, I’ve found out that 5 frames seems to be a safe bet – in other words, I would go to position 20.1 seconds – 5 frames, then simply ignore the first 5 frames. Even though in practice I never met a case when you would still get an invalid frame after the first 5 frames, it doesn’t really mean it can’t happen. This gets even worse if you need to do several seeks at very small intervals.</p><p>

There’s no way to go several frames ahead. You can only <b>StepForwardOneFrame()</b> and <b>StepBackwardOneFrame()</b>. In practice, going backward is roughly 5 times slower.</p><p>

Having several <b>MediaPlayer</b> instances doesn’t help things either – in practice, I noticed that the more instances I would have, the slower everything got.</p><p>

Sometimes, I would get an infinite amount of <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> events, because, that’s how Microsoft rolls.

<a name="n2"></a></p><p>[2] Finally, <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> has memory leaks. I found this out the hard way – from one user being very, lets say, frustrated. At Export, within 60-70 seconds, it sometimes could end eating up 8GB of video RAM when dealing with 4K footage.

<a name="n3"></a></p><p>[3] I’ve pondered about using ffmpeg more times than I can count. </p><p>

There’s a lot of mambo jambo about whether/how you can use this in commercial code, because MPEG LA holds the patent for it – so even if you use your own implementation, you’d still need to pay MPEG LA. It didn't really sit right with me. It's also unclear to me how they would figure out the number of "downloaded copies".</p><p>

I’ve done another round of searching lately, and I’m in talks with <a href="https://x264.org/en/" target="_blank">x264</a> It seems I need to  obtain a license from them, in order to compile ffmpeg to use LGPL (thus, be able to use it commercially) – this would be on top of what I'd pay MPEG LA.</p><p>

I won’t get my hopes up until I receive a quote from them – the fact that you need to request a quote makes me think they’ll do their best to milk you as much as possible.

<a name="n4"></a></p><p>[4] I can hear you screaming – that’s sooo low res! Turns out it’s not. If you come to think about it, most of the time the video takes less than ¼ of the screen, the rest being occupied by the timeline, and other panes. And in the future, I will allow you to select a higher resolution, such as 1280 x 720, or simply 1920 x 1080 if you’ve got some hard core video card.

<a name="n5"></a></p><p>[5] The next steps will be: once you settle on one video frame (you pause the project, and do some editing), to show the video frame at Full HD (1920 x 1080). It’s not as easy as you’d think, but I can do it :) 

<a name="n6"></a></p><p>[6] The more video effects you compound (one video effect on top of another, on top of another, and so on), the more GPU is needed. One of the reasons I chose to go with 640 x 360 resolution is that this gives a quite reasonable number of compound effects that can be played in real time. On a decent video card, you won’t really need any pre-rendering ahead of time (which pretty much breaks your flow).

    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€ enumerate_mappings()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/maps", self.pid))
â”‚   â”‚  â””â”€ some_parsing()
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€ some_more_checks()
â”‚      â””â”€ copy_from_process()
â”‚
â””â”€ dump()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::header::write()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::thread_list_stream::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::mappings::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ elf_identifier_for_mapping()
   â”‚     â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€ sections::app_memory::write()
   â”‚  â””â”€ copy_from_process()
   â”‚
   â””â”€ ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"nix::ptrace() error"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>PtraceError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>nix</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed to copy memory from process"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>CopyFromProcessError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>DumpError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Error during init phase"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>InitError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>InitError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(transparent)]</span>
    <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>PtraceDumperError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>#[error(</span><span>"Failed when writing section AppMemory"</span><span>)]</span>
    <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>(</span><span>#[from]</span> <span>SectionAppMemoryError</span><span>),</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>aaaaand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory: Failed to copy memory from process: nix::ptrace() error: EIO: I/O error
</code></pre></div></div>

  <p>The extremely precise control of nuclear excitations opens up possibilities of ultra-precise atomic clocks and powerful nuclear batteries</p>
  

  

  <p>From atomic clocks to secure communication to quantum computers: these developments are based on the increasingly better control of the quantum behaviour of electrons in atomic shells with the help of laser light. Now, for the first time, physicists at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg have succeeded in precisely controlling quantum jumps in atomic nuclei using X-ray light. Compared with electron systems, nuclear quantum jumps are extreme – with energies up to millions of times higher and incredibly short zeptosecond processes. A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second. The rewards include profound insight into the quantum world, ultra-precise nuclear clocks, and nuclear batteries with enormous storage capacity. The experiment required a sophisticated X-ray flash facility developed by a Heidelberg group led by Jörg Evers as part of an international collaboration.</p>
  
  
<figure data-description="Loss or gain for nuclear excitations: A team from the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg excites nuclei of iron atoms with a flash of X-ray light and then sends a second such flash onto the sample with different delays and detuning. Then, over a period of about 200 nanoseconds, the researchers measure the intensity of the light with which the nuclei release the absorbed energy (light yellow: high intensity; violet: low intensity). They can choose the delay so that the second flash reduces the excitation and the nuclei release their energy quickly and with high intensity (a).

          Loss or gain for nuclear excitations: A team from the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg excites nuclei of iron atoms with a flash of X-ray light and then sends a second such flash onto the sample with different delays and detuning. Then, over a period of about 200 nanoseconds, the researchers measure the intensity of the light with which the nuclei release the absorbed energy (light yellow: high intensity; violet: low intensity). They can choose the delay so that the second flash reduces the excitation and the nuclei release their energy quickly and with high intensity (a). After only 50 nanoseconds, the emission has decreased significantly. In contrast, they still emit a relatively large amount of light after more than 100 nanoseconds if the second pulse amplifies the excitation from the first (b).

<p>One of the great successes of modern physics is the increasingly precise control of dynamic quantum processes. It enables a deeper understanding of the quantum world with all its oddities and is also a driving force of new quantum technologies. But from the perspective of the atoms, “coherent control” has so far remained superficial: it is the quantum jump of the electrons in the outer shell of the atoms that has become increasingly controllable by lasers. But as Christoph Keitel explains, the atomic nuclei themselves are also quantum systems in which the nuclear building blocks can make quantum jumps between different quantum states.</p>
<h2>Energy-rich quantum jumps for nuclear batteries</h2>
<p>“In addition to this analogy to electron shells, there are huge differences”, explains the Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg: “They’ve got us so excited!” Quantum jumps between different quantum states are actually jumps on a kind of energy ladder. “And the energies of these quantum jumps are often six orders of magnitude greater than in the electron shell”, says Keitel. A single quantum jump made by a nuclear component can thus pump up to a million times more energy into it – or get it out again. This has given rise to the idea of nuclear batteries with an unprecedented storage capacity.</p>
<p>Such technical applications are still visions of the future. At the moment, research entails addressing and controlling these quantum jumps in a targeted manner. This requires precisely controlled, high-energy X-ray light. The Heidelberg team has been working on such an experimental technique for over 10 years. It has now been used for the first time.</p>
<h2>Accurate frequencies enable ultra-precise atomic clocks</h2>
<p>The quantum states of atomic nuclei offer another important advantage over electron states. Compared with the electronic quantum jumps, they are much more sharply defined. Because this translates directly into more accurate frequencies according to the laws of physics, they can, in principle, be used for extremely precise measurements. For example, this could enable the development of ultra-precise nuclear clocks that would make today’s atomic clocks look like antiquated pendulum clocks. In addition to technical applications of such clocks (e.g. in navigation), they could be used to examine the fundamentals of today’s physics much more precisely. This includes the fundamental question of whether the constants of nature really are constant. However, such precision techniques require the control of quantum transitions in the nuclei.</p>

<h2>Coordinated light flashes enhance or reduce the excitation</h2>
<p>The principle of the Heidelberg experimental technique sounds quite simple at first. It uses pulses (i.e. flashes) of high-energy X-ray light, which are currently provided by the European Synchrotron Radiation Source ESRF in Grenoble. The experiment splits these X-ray pulses in a first sample in such a way that a second &nbsp;pulse follows behind the rest of the first pulse with a time delay. One after the other, both encounter a second sample, the actual object of investigation.</p>
<p>The first pulse is very brief and contains a broad mix of frequencies. Like a shotgun blast, it stimulates a quantum jump in the nuclei; in the first experiment, this was a special quantum state in &nbsp;nuclei of &nbsp;iron atoms. The second pulse is much longer and has an energy that is precisely tuned to the quantum jump. In this way, it can specifically manipulate the quantum dynamics triggered by Pulse 1. The time span between the two pulses can be adjusted. This allows the team to adjust whether the second pulse is more constructive or destructive for the quantum state.</p>
<p>The Heidelberg physicists compare this control mechanism to a swing. With the first pulse, you push it. Depending on the phase of its oscillation in which you give it a second push, it oscillates even stronger or is slowed down.</p>
<h2>Pulse control accurate to a few zeptoseconds</h2>
<p>But what sounds simple is a technical challenge that required years of research. A controlled change in the quantum dynamics of an atomic nucleus requires that the delay of the second pulse is stable on the unimaginably short time scale of a few zeptoseconds. Because only then do the two pulses work together in a controlling way.</p>
<p>A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second – or a decimal point followed by 20 zeroes and a 1. In one zeptosecond, light does not even manage to pass through one per cent of a medium-sized atom. How can you imagine this in relation to our world? “If you imagine that an atom were as big as the Earth, that would be about 50&nbsp;km, says Jörg Evers, who initiated the project.</p>
<h2>The sample is shifted by 45 trillionths of a metre</h2>

<figure data-description="Principle of coherent control using the example of tuning forks representing the two samples in the experiment. A bang (left, blue) excites both tuning forks to oscillate – analogous to the synchrotron pulse.

          Principle of coherent control using the example of tuning forks representing the two samples in the experiment. A bang (left, blue) excites both tuning forks to oscillate – analogous to the synchrotron pulse. After the bang, the sound of the first fork additionally hits the second fork as the second part of the double pulse. Depending on the delay with which the sound from the first fork hits the second, the vibration of the second fork is either dampened (a) or amplified (b). The control of quantum dynamics in atomic nuclei works in an analogous way.

<p>The second X-ray pulse is delayed by a tiny displacement of the first sample, also containing iron nuclei with the appropriate quantum transition. “The nuclei selectively store energy from the first X-ray pulse for a short period of time during which the sample is rapidly shifted by about half a wavelength of X-ray light”, explains Thomas Pfeifer, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. This corresponds to about 45 trillionths of a metre. After this tiny movement, the sample emits the second pulse.</p>
<p>The physicists compare their experiment to two tuning forks that are at different distances from a firecracker (Figure 2). The bang first strikes the closer tuning fork, making it vibrate, and then moves on to the second tuning fork. In the meantime, the first tuning fork, now excited, emits sound waves itself, which arrive with a delay at the second fork. Depending on the delay time, this sound either amplifies or dampens the vibrations of the second fork – just like the second push on the oscillating swing, as well as for the case of the excited nuclei.</p>
<p>With this experiment, Jörg Evers, Christoph Keitel, and Thomas Pfeifer and their team from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in cooperation with researchers from DESY in Hamburg and the Helmholtz Institute/Friedrich Schiller University in Jena succeeded for the first time in demonstrating coherent control of nuclear excitations. In addition to synchrotron facilities such as those at the ESRF, free-electron lasers (FELs) such as the European XFEL at DESY have recently provided powerful sources of X-ray radiation – even in laser-like quality. This opens up a dynamic future for the emerging field of nuclear quantum optics.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, I took close to two hundred interviews. These interviews range from Java engineers with two years of experience to architects holding more than fifteen years of experience. The first round of our interview process, irrespective of the candidate experience, involves solving a small problem in a Google document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I prefer Google docs because it removes the unnecessary fluff and most candidates are familiar with it. I understand that you may feel awkward and conscious when someone watches you while you are writing code. At the same time, it does give some understanding on how candidates keep calm under pressure, recover from their mistakes, and explain things.</p>



<p>I don’t expect people to write completely syntactically correct formatted code in Google docs. I give them 20 minutes of peaceful time to write the program. I once read that in other tech organizations, it is expected that you explain your approach and your thinking as you write code on a whiteboard (virtual or physical), but I prefer to give people an uninterrupted time so that they don’t have to do two things at a time. I try to make sure that they have understood the problem by giving them a couple of inputs and their expected output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One question that I have used in most of our L1 interview rounds is shown below. Since 2021 I have stopped using this question so I thought it can be useful to share my analysis on how people performed in attempting this problem.</p>



<p><strong><em>You have to write a function that chunks an array into smaller arrays of specified size. For example, chunks([1,2,3,4,5] , 2) should return [[1,2],[3,4], [5]].</em></strong></p>



<p>Coming up with your own “Fizz Buzz Test”[1] is not easy. I came up with the following requirements on which I evaluate such coding questions [2].</p>



<ol><li>It should be a real problem. The kind of problem you solve in a real-world scenario.</li><li>It should feel simple and give confidence to the developer that they can solve it.</li><li>The solution should not require more than 20 lines of code.</li><li>The problem should not be domain specific that it gives advantage to some candidates.</li><li>It should not require any special data structure, which you don’t use in your day to day work.</li><li>Problem should not have a long text. Anyone should be able to read the problem text in less than a minute.</li><li>It should not require knowledge of a special library function.</li><li>A reasonable developer should be able to write the first version in 15-20 minutes. Candidates do tend to miss a few aspects of the problem, so it can involve more than one iteration.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>I have used this question for evaluating Java candidates only. It is possible that it is not a good question for your specific programming language. So, please keep </em></strong><strong><em>this point </em></strong><strong><em>in </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> mind.</em></strong></p>



<p>There are three skills that I am trying to evaluate about the candidate.</p>



<ol><li>Can they code?</li><li>Can they explain the code they have written?</li><li>Can they explain how they will test the code they have written?</li></ol>



<p>Coming back to the chunks problem, one possible Java solution is shown below.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunks(int[] numbers, int chunkSize) {
   int length = numbers.length;
   int resultArraySize = (length % chunkSize == 0) ? length / chunkSize : length / chunkSize + 1;
   int[][] result = new int[resultArraySize][];
 
   int numberArrIndex = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; resultArraySize; i++) {
       int chunkArraySize = i == resultArraySize - 1 &amp;&amp; (length % chunkSize != 0)
               ? length % chunkSize
               : chunkSize;
 
       int[] chunk = new int[chunkArraySize];
 
       for (int j = 0; j &lt; chunkArraySize; j++) {
           chunk[j] = numbers[numberArrIndex++];
       }
       result[i] = chunk;
   }
   return result;
}
</pre>


<p>Java 8 solution using the Stream API is shown below. I don’t expect candidates to write this version.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunk(int[] numbers, int size) {
   return IntStream.iterate(0, i -&gt; i + size)
           .limit((long) Math.ceil((double) numbers.length / size))
           .mapToObj(cur -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(numbers, cur, cur + size &gt; numbers.length ? numbers.length : cur + size))
           .toArray(int[][]::new);
}
</pre>


<p>My analysis is that only 10% of the total candidates solved the problem correctly in the first attempt. 30-40% missed a few scenarios and while explaining the solution they figured out the gaps and suggested improvements to fix their first version. And, remaining 50% failed to write even the partially correct first version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following are my observations on the attempts made by people:</p>



<ul><li>Candidates for some reason choose a function name different from chunks. I fail to understand why they don’t use function name as chunks. Some of the names used by candidates <em>getSmallArray</em>, <em>getChunksArray</em>, <em>getMeArray</em>, <em>getRefactorArray</em>, <em>getChunks</em>, <em>splitArrayInChunks</em>, <em>convertArray</em>, <em>splitArray</em>, <em>chunkInputArray</em>, etc.</li><li>Candidates who did well in the attempt first wrote chunks algorithm in plain English and then attempted to write code.</li><li>Candidates struggled to come up with the correct function declaration in the first go. They directly wrote the first version of the problem and then came up with the correct declaration.</li><li>Many candidates struggled with multi-dimensional array syntax.&nbsp;</li><li>The first solution written by most candidates didn’t handle the last chunk correctly. They created all chunks with equal size. So, the answer returned by their solution is [[1,2], [3,4], [5,0]]. Some candidates while explaining the solution with the example input figured out the problem and explained how they will handle this scenario.</li><li>Candidates struggled with the size of the result array. They need to consider whether the array is fully divisible by chunkSize or leaves a remainder.</li><li>Some candidates at times used String. They failed to make much progress.</li><li>Candidates make chunks an instance method of some class. They don’t think whether they should make the method static. For some reason, they think static is bad.</li><li>Some candidates prefer to convert an array to a List and then only they can write code.&nbsp;</li><li>Java developers still struggle with Generics. Only a handful of them were able to convert the program to a version that uses generics.</li><li>Only a handful of developers can eloquently explain the code they have written.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>By no means I am underestimating the pressure of giving an interview. Both taking a good interview and giving an interview are difficult. I know it is hard for most of us to write code when someone is watching us in an interview. But, given that this is the kind of code we write everyday and we do have to pair with others. I think it is still a better and scalable way to filter good candidates from average candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613670455547/FEONztOOP.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Recently I faced a request</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm tracking the number of days off each person in my company in google sheets, where I manually add/subtract their remaining days off. Can a telegram bot show them how many days off they have left once they search for their names?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is yes, and here is how to do that with Google Cloud Functions and API.chat chatbot platform in <strong>under 100 lines of code</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="setup-google-functions">Setup Google Functions</h2>
<p>First, you need to set up cloud functions and give them access to our document. </p>
<p>Overall you will need two functions: <code>gsheet-get</code> to provide answers and <code>gsheet-add</code> to register users. Let's create them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663747484/Fas9Hx7_q.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We do not care about the function code yet. When you set up the first function GCloud will probably ask you to enable Billing and, most importantly, will create a Service account - App Engine default service account. Usage of this account will allow you to perform <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client#service-account-credentials">server to server, app-level authentication</a>  later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663799653/PyiIOpK2x.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>But you do need to give access rights to our document to this account.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613662238923/jaVl7Falj.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The document itself is quite simple 
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663879198/fqWuUfk7H.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="function-google-sheet-add">Function <code>google-sheet-add</code></h2>
<p>This function will store the user channel (telegram in the case), chat id, and a name to your table. Google Functions support different languages, including <code>.net core 3.1</code>, but I found out that node.js gives more compact code, so let's stick to it, and sorry for <em>dotnetish</em> code-style</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { google } = <span>require</span>(<span>'googleapis'</span>);

<span>exports</span>.main = <span>async</span> (req, res) =&gt; {
  <span>let</span> auth = <span>await</span> google.auth.getClient({ <span>scopes</span>: [<span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'</span>] });  
  <span>let</span> sheets = google.sheets({ <span>version</span>: <span>'v4'</span>, auth });
  <span>try</span>
  {
    <span>await</span> sheets.spreadsheets.values.append({
      <span>spreadsheetId</span>: <span>"INSERT-SHEET-ID-HERE"</span>,
      <span>range</span>: <span>"Days!A:C"</span>,
      <span>valueInputOption</span>: <span>"RAW"</span>,
      <span>insertDataOption</span>: <span>"INSERT_ROWS"</span>,
      <span>resource</span>: {
        <span>values</span>: [
          [req.query.channel, req.query.id, req.query.name]
        ],
      },
      <span>auth</span>: auth
    });    
    res.status(<span>200</span>).send();
  }
  <span>catch</span> (err)
  {
    res.status(<span>500</span>).send({ err })
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>The code here will append provided values as a new row to the Days sheet. API.chat will provide user data such as channel, chat id, and the name of the user.</p>
<p>Don't forget to add <code>googleapis</code> dependency into <code>package.json</code></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"dependencies"</span>: {
    <span>"googleapis"</span>: <span>"^42"</span>
  }

<p>The second function is for getting data from Google Spreadsheet. </p>

</code></pre><p>The main thing I found out here is that google.sheets API filter does not allow you to filter on actual data - only on metadata. That's why you need to get the entire sheet and filter it in code. Like I said before, API.chat will provide your endpoint with chat-id for filtering. From there you can return a formatted string with the answer like that</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Messages"</span>: [
    <span>"You have 7 days off"</span>
  ]
}
</code></pre><h2 id="chatbot-scenario">Chatbot Scenario</h2>
<p>Now when you have all endpoints in place and working you can create an actual chatbot. I will use my very own <a target="_blank" href="https://api.chat/">chatbot builder API.chat</a>. Scenario might be very simple, like that </p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>bot</span>&gt;</span>

February 18, 2021 | https://acoup.blog/2021/02/19/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iii-the-cult-of-the-badass/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://acoup.blog/2021/02/19/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iii-the-cult-of-the-badass/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the splintering arrived: Google cut a deal with News Corp. that will ensure its services continue to be provided in Australia, and Facebook walked away from the bargaining table and began preventing people from sharing news links from Australian publishers around the world. </p><p>I think Facebook basically did the right thing, and Google basically did the wrong thing, even though Google had a much tougher call to make. Today, let’s talk about why the tech giants made the decisions that they did, why Australia’s shakedown is rotten, and what’s likely to happen next. (If you didn’t <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms">read my piece on the subject yesterday</a>, it offers a lot of useful context for what follows. I’ve made it free for all subscribers to read.)</p><p>In development for three years, the bargaining code is intended to give Australia’s heavily concentrated media industry more leverage as publishers seek direct payment from Google and Facebook for the right to display links to their work. It does this by forcing the platforms into binding arbitration with publishers who bring cases, and puts the decision for how much the platform has to pay the publishers into the hands of the arbiter. Each side throws out a number, and the arbiter picks the one they think is most fair. </p><p>(The arbiter does <em>not</em> pick a number in between, by the way; I got that wrong yesterday and have corrected the post.)</p><p>By design, the arbitration process favors the publisher. Also by design, it encourages platforms to avoid the process altogether by signing one-off deals with individual publishers in hopes that they can get better terms that way. </p><p><strong>I. Google</strong></p><p>Over the past few days, Google has been signing deals with the biggest publishers in Australia for exactly this reason. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-australia-news-technology-seven-west-media-2021-2#:~:text=Google%20signed%20up%20a%20major,force%20payments%20to%20media%20outlets.">Seven West Media got a deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/nine-agrees-to-join-google-news-showcase-in-australia-for-reported-30m-a-year#:~:text=Australia's%20biggest%20locally%2Downed%20media,laws%20being%20debated%20in%20parliament.">Nine Entertainment got a deal</a>, and on Wednesday, one of the country’s biggest conglomerates — Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. —&nbsp;got its deal. In exchange for an undisclosed sum, Google will feature News Corp. articles in its News Showcase product in Australia and beyond.</p><p>“Among the News Corp publications joining Google News Showcase will be the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Barron’s</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em>, and the <em>New York Post</em>; in the UK: the<em> Times</em> and the <em>Sunday Times</em>; and the <em>Sun</em>; and in Australia a range of news platforms, including the <em>Australian</em>, news.com.au, Sky News, and multiple metropolitan and local titles,” the company told me in a statement.</p><p>As announced, the deals pertain to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/">Google News Showcase</a>, a tab within Google News that contains licensed content from official partners. But the people I’ve spoken with are operating under the assumption that if there’s a deal between Google and a big publisher in Australia, that publisher either can’t or won’t be dragged to arbitration for showing links and snippets of text in search results.</p><p>Search, of course, is what Google cares about the most, and explains why the company caved. Removing links to news&nbsp;stories from Google would break the search engine in Australia, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/11/endorsement-australias-proposal-technology-news/">opening it up to rivals</a>. And so the company signed a bunch of deals under duress. </p><p>(It’s worth mentioning that any Australian publisher aggrieved by an unfair exchange of value with Google here could opt out of search results&nbsp;at any time by adding one line of HTML to their website. But almost none of them do, because traffic from Google drives significant advertising and subscription revenue to them.)</p><p>With its moves today, Google has now invited every other country to pursue a similar protection racket. Parliament members in Canada and the European Union have already endorsed measures similar to Australia’s. And a basic tenet of the open web — that hyperlinks can be freely displayed on any website —&nbsp;just took a body blow.</p><p>I’d feel better about this if publishers said a single word about how much of their new Google revenue that they planned to spend on journalists’ salaries, or news gathering. </p><p>They didn’t, though, and why would they? Australia’s bargaining code doesn’t say one word about requiring that any of this money be spent on journalism, either.  </p><p><strong>II.</strong> <strong>Facebook</strong></p><p>Unlike Google, Facebook’s core service doesn’t rely heavily on news articles. The company estimates that only about 4 percent of posts on the network are works of journalism. It is not all that hard to imagine opening up Facebook and scrolling for a few minutes, never to see a link to a news article at all —&nbsp;and in fact, millions of people do this every day.</p><p>And so it is perhaps less surprising that when Google blinked at Australia’s demand, Facebook walked away. Here’s William Easton, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand</a>:</p><blockquote><p>While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally&nbsp;<a href="https://australia.fb.com/post/our-response-to-australias-proposed-news-media-laws/">fails to understand</a>&nbsp;how our services work.</p><p>Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.</p></blockquote><p>And just like that, news articles originating in Australia disappeared from Facebook.</p><p>Easton says that in the past year, Facebook sent more than 5 billion clicks to Australian publishers, whose value he estimated at AU$ 407 million. If the current situation holds, Facebook will send those same publishers zero clicks —&nbsp;a move that, I imagine, may force publishers to recalibrate in their minds the relative value that Facebook and publishers provide one another.</p><p>Of course, many critics were apoplectic that Facebook had taken this move, calling it <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1362135211606220800?s=20">a vile act of censorship</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1362172282102304769">unchecked greed</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/evelyndouek/status/1362171044136710144">destruction of the public sphere</a>. </p><p>Certainly the execution of the ban left something to be desired. </p><p>Rather than building a blacklist of news sites to restrict, Facebook tried using its machine learning systems to identify news publishers, and the systems went <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-18/bom-health-authorities-betoota-caught-in-facebook-news-ban/13166394?section=technology">predictably haywire</a>. There were reports that government and emergency pages, nonprofit groups, and the Bureau of Meteorology <a href="https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1362160410984476672?s=21">could no longer share</a>. Given how long the possibility of restricting links has loomed, you’d think Facebook would have better prepared for it to arrive.</p><p>And while I don’t want to make light of these mistakes, to the extent that they teach Facebook’s user base to seek their news elsewhere, they can serve a noble purpose. I don’t know a single journalist who feels comfortable with social networks being anyone’s primary source of news, particularly after years of daily reporting on the misinformation and conspiracy theories that so often thrive on them. And so it is more than a little strange to see so many people insisting that Facebook is obligated to share publishers’ content, on whatever terms those publishers set.</p><p>Some, <a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1362132040544628736?s=20">like OneZero’s Will Oremus</a>, have noted that removing high-quality news sources from Facebook will likely mean a boost for lower-quality blog posts, memes, and other junk. That seems fair, and I do think it bears watching. But what if, in the meantime, Australians simply … visit websites? Subscribe to newsletters? Read … books? I realize I sound hopelessly naive here. But if this is the beginning of more people coming to understand the value in visiting trusted news sources directly, I think we’d all be better off. Publishers included!</p><p>In reality, though, I suspect the great Australian news outage of 2021 will be short lived. Australia’s treasurer, a leading figure in the negotiations, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshfrydenberg/status/1362144150712315905?s=21">said he spoke with Mark Zuckerberg today</a>, and that negotiations continue. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">Fun fact from the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">New York Times</a></em>: Australia’s treasurer was also “<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ryan-stokes-society-wedding-a-sizzler-20161202-gt30re.html" title="">the best man at the wedding of Ryan Stokes</a>, who is a son of Kerry Stokes, the billionaire owner of Seven West Media, one of the companies that have reached a deal with Google.”)</p><p>“We will continue to engage with the government on amendments to the law, with the aim of achieving a stable, fair path for both Facebook and publishers,” Facebook told me today when I asked for an update.</p><p>In the meantime, though, I’m glad Facebook called publishers’ bluff. </p><p><strong>III. What’s next</strong></p><p>I wish Australia would take Facebook’s rejection as a sign it should rethink its approach to media regulation entirely. It could just tax companies based on their revenues, for example. It could earmark those revenues to support journalism — nonprofit public media, even, <a href="http://www.orangemedianetwork.com/blog/screengaze/the-importance-of-public-broadcasting/article_dda75496-e27e-11e6-a558-2f6b46140340.html">which has consistently been shown to have powerful civic benefits</a>. Or it could pursue a bargaining code that requires big media conglomerates to create and support <em>jobs</em> in journalism, rather than simply accept tens of millions of dollars and spend them however they like — or just return it to shareholders.</p><p>In reality, though, none of that seems likely to happen. Google’s capitulation means that Australian crony capitalism is now likely to be exported worldwide. Legacy media outlets will become richer —&nbsp;and also more dependent on the tech giants that they excoriate daily for having too much power over them. All the while, the media industry will continue to consolidate, and it will be harder to get or keep a job in journalism.</p><p>A bargaining code that truly sought to level the playing field between the platforms and the public would take these realities into account. There is still time to amend it before Parliament takes a vote, and here’s hoping that lawmakers do — both&nbsp;in Australia and beyond it.</p><h3>Message received</h3><p>Y’all really, really prefer the standard linking format. So we’re back to normal today — though I still feel like I could make these feel more valuable somehow; maybe just arranging them differently. I’ll keep you posted, but thanks to everyone who wrote in yesterday with feedback!</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies. See if you can spot today’s …</em></p></div></div>
