</p>
<br>


<p><em>J-U-S-T</em>. Those four characters can be significantly detrimental to a software development process. In this blog post, I’ll describe how the <em>“just keyword”</em> can affect team’s communication and how to avoid misusing it on Slack.</p>
<h2 id="lets-just-do-it">Let’s “just” do it</h2>
<p>You’ve probably been there. Your product manager shares his brand new plan on the Slack channel:</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t we</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>add this cool new feature to our application?”</em></p>
<p>or your colleague got the wrong idea about scaling after reading a HackerNews story:</p>
<p><em>“Let’s</em> <strong>just</strong> <em>migrate our infrastructure to Kubernetes…“</em></p>
<p><em>“Just”</em> is toxic and dangerous. It implicitly suggests that the proposed task is straightforward. It undermines the discussion about the issues that might pop-up during the implementation.</p>
<p>There’s no <em>“just”</em> in software development. Most of the tasks turn out to be more complex than anticipated. <em>“Just tickets”</em> tend to drag, evolve into epics, miss deadlines and hurt the team’s motivation.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this topic discussed many times before. Make sure to check out <a href="https://alistapart.com/blog/post/the-most-dangerous-word-in-software-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these two</a> <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/brad-frost/2014-january-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog posts</a> for a more in-depth description of it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-slack-to-get-rid-of-just-tickets">How to use Slack to get rid of “Just tickets”</h2>
<p>I want to propose a solution to the <em>“Just”</em> problem. Lexically there’s never a need to include the word <em>“just”</em> in a sentence. You can always omit it without altering the core meaning of your message.</p>
<p>You could discourage using the word <em>“just”</em> in communication. Slack offers a simple feature that will let you automate it. Introducing Slackbot triggers:</p>
<p><img alt="Slack keyword trigger in action" title="Slack keyword trigger in action" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-keyword-trigger-40d3219d92fe2bee0932a832ff7c80608c9b99a067f704347ed564dec917bc1e.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger in action</p>

<p>You can configure Slack to automatically send a custom message whenever a <em>trigger</em> keyword is detected. In settings, go to <strong>Customize &gt; Slackbot</strong> and enter your desired trigger and response.
<br></p>
<p><img alt="Slack trigger settings" title="Slack trigger settings" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-trigger-settings-3456bc59b61b75a27c245690b2d0a5d57afd8e2ac535027c9d01e3a87c54cffb.png"></p>
<p>Slack trigger settings</p>

<p>It could be pretty spammy to start with, but your team should quickly adjust and stop using the <em>forbidden</em> keyword. If someone does use it, the alert message will be a fun reminder to stop and think twice if the <em>“just”</em> idea is really that simple.</p>
<p>So why won’t you just give this communication experiment a try?</p>
<p>BTW if you’re looking for more creative ways to enhance your communication on Slack, you can check out <a href="https://abot.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abot for anonymous messaging and polls</a>. It’s highly configurable and supports various <a href="https://abot.app/scenarios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usage scenarios</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Anonymous poll conducted using Abot for Slack" title="Anonymous poll conducted using Abot for Slack" loading="lazy" src="https://pawelurbanek.com/assets/slack-anonymous-poll-bda619f03336795730c69705f61eddc8f4bac6a6bcd8deb65e83bf3ff880156d.png"></p>

<p>After big-tech censorship silenced social media company Parler on January 11, 2020, they are back online with new servers as well as new leadership.</p>



<p>Over one month ago Amazon Web Services removed Parler from their servers, taking them offline.&nbsp; Google and Apple also removed them from their app stores. &nbsp; They claimed that the platform was used to “incite, organize, and coordinate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.”</p>



<p>Defense and National Guard officials, including now former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, have stated in interviews that federal law enforcement authorities indicated there was activity relating to the organizing of the Capitol attack on Twitter also.</p>



<p>Parler execs said it was a war on free speech, and Amazon stated that requests to remove violent content, including death threats against public figures were ignored.</p>



<p>In addition, their co-founder and CEO, John Matze was terminated by their board on January 29 over differences in company visions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parler’s interim CEO Mark Meckler told<a href="https://justthenews.com/nation/culture/welcome-back-parler-resumes-social-media-app-after-securing-new-computer-servers?utm_source=breaking-newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter#article"> Just the News</a> that “20 million users who were already using the app can begin logging back in on Monday, and new users should be able to sign up in approximately one week.”</p>



<p>“He also said the platform is using artificial intelligence and human editors to police for illegal speech that violates its service agreement but otherwise is remaining true to its free speech, no censorship roots.”</p>



<p>According to his<a href="https://twitter.com/MarkMeckler?s=20"> Twitter</a> account, Meckler is the President of the Convention of States Project, Co-Founder and former National Coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, Constitutional Revolutionary, Husband, Father, and Son.</p>



<p>“Parler is being run by an experienced team and is here to stay,” Meckler said in a statement. “We will thrive as the premier social media platform dedicated to free speech, privacy and civil dialogue.”</p>



<p>There are still some issues with the platform as many people are reporting the site is still not accessible, but it seems their return is imminent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A writeup detailing the vulnerability reporting process that took place after Sakura Samurai had breached the Indian Government</p><p>Reading time: 6 minutes.</p><div>
      

<p>Sakura Samurai knew that the Indian Government operated an RVDP (Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program). <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> put a list together of initial assets in scope for Sakura Samurai to legally test. <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> reported that he had found sensitive data and was able to breach police assets. <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> was working in the enumeration processes with his friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001" title="https://twitter.com/orpheus9001">Zultan Holder</a> [not an active Sakura Samurai member] and identified a slew of various attack vectors, immediately resulting in the exposure of many pairs of credentials for databases and other pertinent applications.</p>
<p>The team was informed of the initial enumeration results as they continued to work on the list of assets within scope, while also further jumping into the research and began performing analysis on the sensitive data, identifying additional vectors of attack, exposed PII, and even more credentials.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai team members included <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a>, and<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking"> John Jackson</a></p>
<p>In total, the following vulnerabilities were identified, in no specific order:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 Separate Instances of Exposed Credential Pairs (Servers, Important Applications, etc)</li>
<li>3 Instances of Sensitive File Disclosure</li>
<li>5 Exposed private-key pairs for servers</li>
<li>13K+ PII Records [and those are only the records that we were inadvertently exposed to]</li>
<li>Dozens of Exposed Sensitive Police Reports</li>
<li>Session Hijacking Chained via Multiple Vulnerabilities, resulting in the compromise of extremely sensitive government systems</li>
<li>Remote Code Execution on a sensitive financial server; a server that contained large backups of Financial Records</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, it is important to note that so many Critical findings had been identified during our testing that we cannot possibly include all of the vulnerabilities without making this writeup unnecessarily heavy. Therefore, we have opted to include small snippets of repetitive findings in this section. Many variations of application and server credentials also were obtained but the point has already been made.</p>
<p><strong>Exposed Database Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/db-creds.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Private SSH Keys</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/priv-ssh.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive File Exposure</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/sens-file-exp.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Exposed PHP Mailer Credentials</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/mailer.png" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rej_ex" title="https://twitter.com/rej_ex">Robert Willis</a> identified an application that resulted in a vulnerability that allowed him to access Sensitive Police Records, containing PII of individuals listed on the report. In addition, sample forensic reports and forensic tooling that is used by the police department was identified by Willis. The exposure of citizen’s sensitive information, some being victims, is a sensitive subject within itself and highly alarming.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/police2.png" alt=""><br>
Shortly after, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax" title="https://twitter.com/JacksonHHax">Jackson Henry</a> found a vulnerability that resulted in the exposure of 14,000+ user records. The records included a wide range of sensitive information, including full name, contact info, employee’s department, date of birth, etc. These exposed records along with other various SQL server dumps and Rob’s Police Record Exposure is enough to constitute a data breach without even logging into any of the servers.</p>
<p>Henry identified many credential pairs which could have resulted in even more exploitation of many other people. The PII identified is a small sample of a much larger issue.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/14k-records.png" alt=""><br>
<a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> was able to identify a relevant Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, affecting an out-of-date application residing on one of the government servers. The remote code execution vulnerability allowed for complete access to sensitive files on the server, including the ability to exfiltrate complete backups of financial records [although data exfiltration wasn’t performed to avoid unnecessary action]</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce1.png" alt=""><br>
<img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/rce2.png" alt=""><br>
Finally, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner" title="https://www.twitter.com/Kirtaner">Aubrey Cottle</a> identified the presence of what appeared to be an extremely important application being hosted by the same server that John had achieved successful Remote Code Execution on. Cottle then chained together multiple vulnerabilities in conjunction with the Remote Code Execution vulnerability, resulting in the ability to hijack any user’s session on the web application. The application contained troves of sensitive government data and could have given a threat actor the ability to perform highly-critical, admin-based government actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/session-chained.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Even though the Indian Government has a RVDP in place, we didn’t feel comfortable disclosing the vulnerabilities right away. The hacking process was far from the standard situation of business-as-usual security research. In total, our report compounded to a massive 34 page report worth of vulnerabilities. We knew that our intent was good, but we wanted to ensure that the US Government had eyes on the situation. Sakura Samurai coordinated with the <a href="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP" title="https://twitter.com/DC3VDP">U.S. DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)</a> to assist in facilitating initial conversations of disclosure. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking" title="https://twitter.com/johnjhacking">John Jackson</a> spoke with DC3’s Program Manager via email and coordinated on a plan of action.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-1.png" alt=""><br>
Roughly 4 days later, after further communication with the DC3, we felt safe to begin our initial reveal of research on the NCIIPC’s RVDP program.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, the DC3 also commended the hacking that we did in support of making the cyberspace a better place for everyone.</p>
<p><img src="https://johnjhacking.com/uploads/dc3-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, what seemed like a done deal turned out to be quite the unprofessional ride. Any organization knows that fixing breach-worthy vulnerabilities is extremely time sensitive. Once threat actors catch wind of major vulnerabilities against an organization they begin poking on their own, looking for more vectors of attack. Immediately upon revealing that Sakura Samurai was the group responsible for hacking the Indian Government, we followed up with them via Email.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>2021/02/04</strong> - DC3 begins initial contact with the Indian Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai informs the public that they breached the Government.<br>
<strong>2021/02/08</strong> - Sakura Samurai makes contact with the NCIIPC, noting that the report that they received was a result of their research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - The NCIIPC responds, with a basic acknowledgement and thank you for the research.<br>
<strong>2021/02/09</strong> - Sakura Samurai asks for clarification on patching and the responsibility of breach disclosure to the public.<br>
<strong>2021/02/10</strong> - Sakura Samurai, having received no response, asks for an update on the involved remediation and breach notification processes.<br>
<strong>2021/02/16</strong> - Sakura Samurai once again asks for NCIIPC’s plans for remediation and disclosure.<br>
<strong>2021/02/17</strong> - The NCIIPC makes contact, 7-days later, stating that they will follow up in a short time. Again, we ask about plans of anticipated patching and breach notification to the affected citizens.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - In the morning, we ask again about patching and disclosure, 8-hours later and still no response on the matter.<br>
<strong>2021/02/19</strong> - Sakura Samurai reviews the submitted vulnerability report and notes that only about an eighth or less of the submitted Critical Vulnerabilities have been resolved within a two-week period. No notification of breach has occurred even though Government Employees and Indian Citizens are at risk of exploitation from threat actors.</p>

<p>Governments have an obligation to protect the private data of its employees and citizens. In addition, the exposure of proprietary government data can be used for great means of manipulation and for other destructive purposes. While the NCIIPC operates a Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure Program, the recklessness and avoidance of communication represents the complete opposite of a responsible program. A failure to release notification of breach to affected citizens and to patch highly-critical vulnerabilities in a timely manner reflects poorly on the state of their Information Security posture. The clock to patch vulnerabilities began immediately when the DC3 contacted the NCIIPC via Twitter, as it is a highly visible space - one which threat actors avidly monitor.</p>
<p>Sakura Samurai urge the NCIIPC to patch the remainder of the vulnerabilities. The criticality of some of the issues cannot wait weeks or months for adequate resolution.</p>

<p>Whenever a software project needs to implement immutable records, people often start thinking of Blockchain or <strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>L</strong>edger <strong>T</strong>echnology like Hyperledger. Blockchain and DLT make use of cryptographic techniques that enable immutability, verifiability and integrity checks. However, Blockchain and DLT need much more than just these checks. It needs to prevent all the attempts of a double-spend by potential malicious users. In a trust-less environment it needs implementation of complex protocols which leads to consumption of huge amount of electricity. This makes writing data on Blockchain costly. DLTs like Hyperledger make use of simpler consensus algorithms between a “set of trusted nodes”, which reduces the cost. However, it still incurs significant costs if nothing more than immutability, verifiability and integrity were the concern.</p>



<p>This post is about how to implement data immutability, verifiability and integrity without using a Blockchain or a DLT in industrial strength software applications.</p>

<h2 id="foundation">Foundational technique – Cryptographic Hashing</h2>



<p>To understand the solution, some foundational techniques must be understood. This section describes what is cryptographic hashing. Those who are already aware of cryptographic hashing, they may skip to the next section.</p>



<h4 id="hash-function">Cryptographic hash function</h4>



<p>If you provide a stream of bytes to a cryptographic hash function, it generates a number called hash (also referred to as digest). The following properties make it a very useful tool:</p>



<ol><li>It is impossible to guess the generated hash value for a stream of bytes. To get the hash value, one has to run the algorithm, there is no shortcut.</li><li>For a given input it always generates the same hash value.</li><li>It is infeasible to deduce the input based on the hash value. That means it is an irreversible mathematical function.</li><li>No two different stream of bytes result in the same hash value. Even a small change in the input stream generates a totally different number.&nbsp;<em>(When two different stream of bytes produce the same hash value, we say the cryptographic hash function is broken. It is also referred to as there is a collision in the cryptographic hash function.)</em></li><li>Any size of input stream will always result in the same size of hash value. Some hash functions generate hash values that are 256 bits long. If those functions are used, the result will always be 256 bits long.</li></ol>



<p>Examples of commonly used cryptographic hash functions include:</p>



<ul><li>SHA-256 (returns 256 bit&nbsp;unsigned integers)</li><li>RIPEMD-160 (returns 160 bit unsigned integers)</li></ul>



<p>Sample hash values:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Input</strong></td><td><strong>SHA-256</strong></td><td><strong>RIPEMD-160</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hello world</td><td>0x64ec88ca00b268e5ba1a35678a1b5316d212f4f366b2477232534a8aeca37f3c</td><td>0xdbea7bd24eef40a2e79387542e36dd408b77b21a</td></tr><tr><td>Hello world.</td><td>0xaa3ec16e6acc809d8b2818662276256abfd2f1b441cb51574933f3d4bd115d11</td><td>0x6ad34a17d22d67a7ab02710ae9eb6f282cb1d787</td></tr><tr><td>Unrelated, totally.</td><td>0x2bd72f5c4300444890325b3363ef2027f30ed38797c3133dbc62a90564976458</td><td>0x51cb1844d22a00d5f659795e0b1c339c6fa1a8bc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Hex representation of SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash values for different inputs</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are two things we observe from the table above:</p>



<ol><li>With a slight change in input, the hash values change dramatically and by looking only at the hash values, one cannot conclude&nbsp;that&nbsp;the first and second are&nbsp;even closely related. This is also referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">avalanche effect</a>. It is one of requirements of a cryptographic algorithms to have the avalanche effect.</li><li>The values mentioned are actually text strings and do not look like numbers, although we expected them to be numbers.</li></ol>



<p>They are actually numbers, represented this way to reduce the size of the presented text. For example, binary representation of the number 255&nbsp;is ‘11111111’. Decimal representation is ‘255’. Hexadecimal representation is ‘ff’ or ‘FF’. The representations in the table above are hexadecimal representations of 32 byte and 20 byte numbers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">base64encoding</a> is commonly used to represent the hash values in cryptographic applications.</p>



<h2 id="verifiability">Verifiability</h2>



<p>For quite some time, open source software has been distributed through various mirror sites so that downloads are sped up. Any user could download the software package quickly from a nearby mirror site. These nearby sites could be malicious and could provide compromised open source software packages. In order to overcome this problem, open source software builds would publish a checksum file on their website. This checksum file is used to verify that the downloaded package from a nearby mirror site is authentic. The checksum file actually contains a cryptographic hash of the software package.</p>



<p>For example: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums/3.4.1_checksums.html" target="_blank">Apache OpenOffice – Download checksum files</a>.</p>



<pre>e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</pre>



<p>This is the content from SHA256 checksum file for <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/files/stable/3.4.1/Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz.sha256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apache Open Office SDK for Linux x86-64</a> build.</p>



<p>It would not matter which mirror site the SDK is downloaded from. A user can easily verify the authenticity of the download using a simple command like:</p>



<pre><code>$ sha256sum Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz
e08f9c8acecba1ee0046f820b0abed97dfe90511bd733a65936fdf0ea9c22540  Apache_OpenOffice_incubating-SDK_3.4.1_Linux_x86-64_install-rpm_en-US.tar.gz</code></pre>



<p>If the generated SHA256 does not match with the checksum file, the user knows that the software package has been tampered.</p>



<p>We will use the same technique to verify data objects. The data object we are interested in would have an ID. Any application or service asks for objects using IDs. If the data that the application gets does not generate the same hash value as the ID, then the application can easily conclude that the data is not what was asked for or the data has mutated. On a typical hardware the cryptographic hash function would take a few microseconds to generate the hash value. So, this is not costly and offers good verifiability.</p>



<p>In the context of this post, the verifiability that we are seeking is not because we operate in a trust-less or adversarial environment like Blockchains, but mainly because data can become corrupt or can be deliberately changed by hackers / attackers. This is for companies to verify that the data they hold has not been modified undesirably.</p>



<h4 id="verify-id">Application: Deterministic and Verifiable IDs</h4>



<p>In a typical RESTful request, a client posts a request to a service, and the service returns back an ID. The service uses the ID to index the object that got created due to the request. However, with a predetermined ID generation technique, it is possible for the client to know the ID even before the service receives the request. This is done even in blockchains. The transactionID (also referred as <a href="https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/TXID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TXID</a>) is a hash computed from certain fields of a transaction request.</p>



<p>To be able to know the ID of an object that will be returned by a service even before the object is created in a service has significant benefits. </p>



<ol><li>Just by computing the ID from the fields of an object, and comparing it with the ID provided in the object, one can determine if the object is the right object. Housekeeping processes can easily determine data corruption or software bugs or potential attacks.</li><li>Request need not be processed synchronously.</li><li>The client can fire a batch of requests in just one call. Each individual request can easily be identified by the request id which will be deterministic for both the client and the service. This eliminates the need to create IDs on the client side, and map them to the server side IDs.</li><li>Non-idempotent requests such as HTTP POST requests can achieve deterministic behaviour. Multiple POST requests (which could be because of software bug or infrastructural replays) will not cause harm, as the request ID is predetermined. The server can easily identify a duplicate request.</li></ol>



<p>Example: To generate an OrderID, one could take the sha256 of a series of bytes of the quantity, price, dateTime of the order, clientID, and the assetID or assetSymbol.</p>



<pre><code>OrderID = sha256(bytes(qty)||bytes(price)||bytes(dateTime)||bytes(clientID)||bytes(assetID))</code></pre>



<h4 id="data-format">Data format and ID Generation</h4>



<p>While the scheme above for ID generation works, it has a certain drawback. For every type of objects, a developer would have to write an ID generator. This is not desirable. For a majority of the types of objects, the id generator should just be available easily. For this, the object itself can be serialised and the serialised stream of bytes can be hashed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that text based data structures like JSON, XML are not very well suited for this. The main reason behind this is that adding a space or TAB within the document will not alter the data for JSON or XML, however will yield a totally different hash value and therefore a totally different object ID. Hence, it is better to use serialisation formats designed for cross platform, multiple language environments and are deterministic. Compact data serialisation like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers" target="_blank">protocol buffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/" target="_blank">FlatBuffers</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://avro.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Avro</a> and even <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049" target="_blank">CBOR</a> are much better suited for this.</p>



<h2 id="immutability">Immutability and Verifiability</h2>



<p>Software professionals often jump to Blockchain to achieve immutability even in a non-adversarial environment like most business applications. Any party explicitly trying to cheat would face the court, and fraudulent transactions can be reverted in the most common business applications seen throughout the world. Therefore, there is no need for all the complexity and consensus algorithms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. Even on DLTs there are algorithms like Raft which are used to achieve consensus. Although much lesser in the power consumption, raft could still be an overkill for some …</p></div></div>

<p>Consider a trio of moments of entangled spacetime:</p>



<p>Jan. 7, 2021, cyberspace and Washington, D.C.: A staggering 4,112 people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/coronavirus-deaths.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">die</a> of the coronavirus in America, a new record. Elon Musk becomes the richest person in the world and reiterates his plan to leave Earth and start a colony on Mars.</p>



<p>Dec. 7, 1972, near-Earth orbit: The crew of <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a002600/a002680/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Apollo 17</a>, 18,000 miles from home and on their way to the moon, snap a photograph of Earth. Illuminated by the sun and nestled in the sable sea of outer space, the “Blue Marble” image becomes a resonant icon of humans’ dear and fragile life-filled planet. Earth’s denizens wonder: Are there other worlds beyond? Or is this the only example of life in the universe?</p>



<p>Nov. 7, 1957, Calcutta, India: Two prominent biologists, Joshua Lederberg and J.B.S. Haldane, meet for dinner. A month earlier, the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Lederberg and Haldane <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/bb/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584906X13253-doc" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">determine</a> that a thermonuclear bomb detonated on the moon would be visible to Earthlings, and it would be so destructive it would spoil the possibility of finding traces of lunar life.</p>



<p>Lifted from three interspaced epochs of the ongoing Space Age — the COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental movement and the Cold War — those moments reveal how terrestrial troubles are entwined with hopes of discovering life, and of living, beyond Earth. As dreams to explore the cosmos curl skyward, fears and anxieties particular to each moment raise doubts not only about humans’ longevity on our home planet, but also about how we might inhabit and sustain life on other worlds as space-faring explorers. If humans self-destruct through nuclear war, poison the planet by churning out carbon into the atmosphere or fail to control a deadly virus, such events would preclude us from existing on Earth, living long enough to communicate with possible extraterrestrial beings and venturing to other worlds we might discover to be habitable.</p>



<p>Thus, fears of terrestrial apocalypse animate pursuits for life and living beyond Earth. But conversely, imagining how life (including human life) might exist in an extraterrestrial context, and seeing the planet from outer space, has driven imaginations of Earth’s possible futures — both hopeful, course-correcting pathways, but also escapist fantasies of extraplanetary colonization.</p>



<p>Anticipations of worlds <em>beyond</em> Earth — places that might be (or might be made to be) habitable — are made possible by conceiving <em>of</em> Earth as both threatened and interconnected: The coronavirus’s march across the world reveals the viruses’ disregard for political borders, the environmental movement highlighted the fragility of the planet’s entangled life and the Cold War ushered in the concept of global nuclear disaster.</p>



<p>These threats have, in different ways, revealed how actions are never self-contained in global, networked systems. Each moment’s particular planetary anxieties — pathogenic, climate, nuclear — have animated and informed scientists’ pursuit of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<h5><strong>Annihilation</strong></h5>



<p>On Oct. 4, 1957, Sputnik Istreaked across the sky. Touching off the “space race” between the United States and the Soviet Union, the satellite represented the opposition between democracy and communism. “Artificial earth satellites will pave the way to interplanetary travel,” the Communist Party’s official newspaper <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/14.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">announced</a> the following day, and “our contemporaries will witness how the freed and conscientious labor of the people of the new socialist society makes the most daring dreams of mankind a reality.”</p>



<p>Sputnik I was particularly visible from the southern hemisphere, where Nobel Prize-winning microbiologist Joshua Lederberg happened to be traveling. A month later, on his way back to Stanford University, where he taught and researched, Lederberg passed through Calcutta to visit his friend and collaborator J.B.S. Haldane. Haldane had formulated the “<a href="https://www.uv.es/~orilife/textos/Haldane.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">primordial soup</a>” model — how life could have originated from <span data-note="Abiogenic means not produced by the activity of living organisms; abiogenesis is the process by which life could have evolved from non-living materials.">abiogenic</span> materials on an ancient Earth. Both scientists looked forward to that night’s lunar eclipse.</p>



<p>Over dinner, Haldane — a “confirmed Communist” and “radical alternativist,” according to Lederberg — “gloated” that it was also the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the October Revolution, the event that had precipitated the formation of the Soviet Union. As a thought experiment, the two scientists wondered: What if the Soviets leveraged the symbolic occasion to plant a “red star” — a nuclear bomb — on the moon? Their back-of-the-napkin calculation revealed that it would be visible from Earth.</p>



<p>Of course, there was no “red star” that evening, and the U.S. astronauts of the Apollo 11 mission, not Soviet cosmonauts, would be the first to land on the moon twelve years later, in 1969. But the conversation with Haldane about the possibility for off-Earth atomic destruction spurred Lederberg toward the study of “exobiology,” the search to detect and preserve life beyond Earth. As the U.S. and the Soviet Union’s space race accelerated during the Cold War, the National Academy of Sciences established the Space Science Board (SSB) to research outer space and to recommend policies to NASA. That group, which included Lederberg and other prominent scientists (among them a young Carl Sagan), worked to protect the moon and other extraterrestrial sites as scientific laboratories.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to possible NASA missions that would explore Mars and Venus for traces of life, a 1959 SSB report that Lederberg chaired transported Cold War fears of nuclear war on Earth to celestial bodies beyond. It warned that “the effect of introducing radioactivity on another planet where there may be entirely different levels of background radiation from those found on Earth could greatly influence any form of life found there.” Planetary concerns of atomic fallout migrated to unexplored sites beyond our planet.</p>



<p>In addition to nuclear radiation on other planets, the possibility of microbial contamination presented risks in the search for life beyond Earth. A spacecraft landing on Mars, for example, might bring terrestrial hitchhikers, risking a false detection of organic biochemistry that would muddle attempts to theorize the origin of life in the solar system and possibly the cosmos beyond. Throughout the late 1950s and the 60s, exobiologists’ reports urged sterilization protocols be taken so as to preserve possible “planetary biota” on Mars.</p>



<p>At the same time, exobiologists worried that possible Martian microbes might infect Earth; through incautious activity by either the U.S. or the Soviet Union, a “dramatic hazard would be the introduction of a new disease, imperiling human health,” as Lederberg wrote in 1960. This particular threat took center stage in Michael Crichton’s 1969 science fiction book (and subsequent film) “The Andromeda Strain,” in which a mysterious and fatal extraterrestrial microorganism appears in Arizona and threatens to end life on Earth. Merging apocalypses, the characters consider annihilating the infected laboratory with a nuclear bomb.</p>



<p>Civilian scientists’ goals to detect extraterrestrials were often <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/344962?seq=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">at odds</a> with those of the national agencies they answered to. While John F. Kennedy’s 1962 “<a href="https://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">We choose to go to the moon</a>” speech mandated the priority of manned missions to outer space that would showcase national prestige, exobiologists advocated for international efforts to preserve (extra)terrestrial life forms. A 1961 SSB report suggested that the U.S. and the Soviet Union work together on sterilization protocols to “simplify the problem of protection against possible contamination of the planets and of the Earth.” The planetary struggle for political dominance, which threatened to plunge Earth into a nuclear apocalypse, was thus shaping extraplanetary pursuits.</p>



<p>As they considered Earth and extraterrestrial sites of possible life (Mars’s subsurface, Venus’s atmosphere and even, possibly, the moon’s dust) in tandem, exobiologists began to imagine interconnected, but distinct, planetary wholes. Linking Earth to planets beyond, two exobiologists wrote in a 1961 <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/12425/chapter/1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a>, “The planets of the solar system are part of a whole — in their origins, in their present states and in their futures.” Such exercises that forecasted other worlds soon came to intersect with growing concerns about the fragility of our own planet.</p>

<h5><strong>Interconnection</strong></h5>



<p>Amid the persistent threat of nuclear apocalypse that defined the Cold War era, exobiologists began to call for planetary protection protocols for both Earth and extraterrestrial sites — concerns that became increasingly aligned with a burgeoning consciousness about humans’ harmful activities on Earth. Rachel Carson’s 1962 book “Silent Spring” introduced the idea that synthetic chemicals, especially pesticides — which she <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/05/reviews/carson-obit.html?_r=2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">argued</a> should be called “biocides” — were fundamentally altering life on Earth. The ensuing environmental movement of the 1960s and 70s culminated in the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and made “the environment” a widespread public concern, fortifying the concept that life systems were interconnected, malleable and fragile.</p>

February 21, 2021 | https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><nav aria-label="breadcrumb"><ol><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ditto.live/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer">The New Network Multiplexer </a></li></ol></nav><p>Since the first versions of Ditto, devices always made multiple connections to other peers. For example, two iOS devices will try to connect simultaneously over WiFi, Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL), and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We make multiple connections because each transport has different characteristics such as throughput and distance. For example, Bluetooth Low Energy works over long distances but has little bandwidth. AWDL has much more bandwidth but the devices need to be close together.</p>
<p>In the example below we see two iPhones syncing over AWDL and BLE. As one device gets further from the other, the AWDL connection will degrade and disconnect while the BLE connection sustains longer distances.</p>

<h2 id="pre-version-1.0.0">Pre-Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>Before version 1.0.0, Ditto created a unique replication session for every transport. This is the software component which tracks queries and data changes and ensures that every Ditto device stays in sync. These separate replication pathways can appear or disappear as connections come and go, without disrupting sibling sessions.</p>
<p>When there is new data to sync, a session packs that data into an update file. With multiple concurrent sessions, all of them would then race against each other to transmit that update file as quickly as possible, regardless of duplication between transports. Transactional locking on the internal database made sure that only one session at a time could modify the update file, which prevented race conditions. Since any session is able to maintain the update file, any individual session can fail and replication will always continue, providing a high level of reliability.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/old-way.svg" alt="old-way-sessions"></p>
<p>In this benchmark we see the consequences of each session sending data eagerly over every transport. In an attempt to send a document with about 2 megabytes of data, all five connected modes of transport aggressively sent data as fast as they could. We can see that the highly efficient AWDL transports could send all bytes first, and the remote peer quickly notified the slower connections that they could stop. However, the slower transports had already sent duplicate bytes. In the end, the peer had sent 5.4 megabytes even though the document size was about 2 megabytes. This was 2.6 times larger than the initial payload. Furthermore, this fully occupied the BLE radio, consuming bandwidth that could have been better used by a Bluetooth-only peer.</p>
<div>

    <thead>
      <tr>

        <td>5390896</td>
        <td>134</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


<p>In version 1.0.0, we’ve introduced a completely new system for creating sync sessions between peers we call the multiplexer. Our first order of business was to reduce the duplication of sessions to the same peer over multiple transport types. We’ve introduced the concept of a virtual connection between two peers. No matter how many transport connections are active, there will only be one virtual connection and only one session. Now incoming data is buffered and intermediated from the transport layer to a single virtual connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ditto.live/assets/blog/posts/the-new-network-multiplexer/new-way.svg" alt="new-way-multiplexer"></p>
<p>This new architecture allows each virtual connection to intelligently send data over multiple physical transports with fine-grained control. For example, the multiplexer can switch active transports on the fly without unnecessary duplication.</p>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The multiplexer on the left device deemed that TCP (WiFi) was the best transport to start sending data.</li>
<li>Suddenly, the infastructure WiFi goes out, and the multiplexer switches to AWDL.</li>
<li>As the device moves away from its peer, AWDL is lost and the multiplexer switches to BLE.</li>
<li>The devices move closer together and the multiplexer finishes the rest of the transmission over AWDL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the total bytes sent is equal to the size of the update file.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Transport</th>
        <th>Bytes Sent</th>
        <th>Packets Sent</th>

        <td>2097944</td>
        <td>246</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The introduction of the multiplexer is a gigantic step forward for Ditto's networking capabilities. Today, it focuses on using one transport at a time but this new foundation allows us to build even more powerful, dynamic and flexible replication techniques such as using multiple transports at a time over unreliable connections, streaming use cases, and decentralized data sync techniques reminiscent of BitTorrent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software Development Kits (SDK) and Application Programming Interface (API) are critical components of your app’s development. However, these two terms sometimes overlap, often leading to confusion.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Knowing their differences and how you can take advantage of them can significantly help you improve your application. This piece tackles their distinct features and outlines how you can utilize them to supercharge your app.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an API?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>By definition, APIs are sets of instructions and protocols used to integrate specific functionalities into an application. An API can help connect your apps or projects to external services, enabling seamless data transfer and adding a new feature altogether.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at this example from software company <a href="https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api">Mulesoft</a> explaining the function of an API:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>Imagine you’re sitting at a table in a restaurant with a menu of choices to order from. The kitchen is the part of the “system” that will prepare your order. What is missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That’s where the waiter or API comes in. The waiter is the messenger – or API – that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen – the system – what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.</em><br></blockquote><p>With an API, developers don’t have to worry about creating lots of custom code to enable functionalities, as various APIs exist to fulfill a specific function. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Youtube&amp;utm_content=000023UA&amp;utm_term=10010608&amp;utm_id=YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmc=OSocial_Youtube-_-Cloud+and+Data+Platform_SFT+Cloud+Platform+Digital-_-WW_WW-_-YTDescription-101-API-vs-SDK-LH-API-Guide&amp;cm_mmca1=000023UA&amp;cm_mmca2=10010608">IBM</a> mentioned, APIs allow companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality for third-party developers to use. So if you have a food delivery app and want to verify your user’s number, provide the location, and enable payment without leaving the platform, there’s an available phone, maps, and payment API to perform these actions.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is an SDK?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>On the other hand, SDKs are a set of tools used to develop applications for a specific platform. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-SDK">Red Hat</a> mentioned that a typical SDK contains a compiler, debugger, as well as APIs, and any of the following:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Documentation</li><li>Libraries</li><li>Editors</li><li>Runtime/development environments</li><li>Testing/analysis tools</li><li>Drivers</li><li>Network protocols<br></li></ul><p>Let’s take the restaurant scenario again. For example, you are a chef. When you’re cooking a dish, you will need ingredients for your recipe; you need the kitchen utensils so you can cook, you need a copy of a recipe to put the meal together, and so on. In the same way, SDK provides all the things you need to create your intended application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs are crucial when developing an app for a specific platform. For instance, Apple provides iOS SDKs to developers so they can create applications specifically for iOS. An SDK should add value to a developer. Hence it should be easy to use, provides a thorough explanation of the code used, and adds functionality to an existing app.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Things to remember&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Now that we defined both, let us recap:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>APIs facilitates the communication and integration of software</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDK provides the foundation to build an application specifically for a platform</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>SDKs contain APIs; APIs don’t contain SDKs<br></li></ul><p>API, as a part of an SDK, is lightweight and specialized based on the function intended. Meanwhile, SDKs have a collection of utilities to create a new application or add new functionalities.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>API and SDK can elevate your app&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Now that we know the differences, how can you take advantage of both to improve your app?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Utilizing SDKs with the APIs that meet your needs can significantly enhance your application’s functionality. According to <a href="https://marketfinder.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en/guide/improve-ux-ui-of-app/#overview">Google</a>, mobile users spend nine out of ten minutes using only their top five favorite apps. So how can your app be one of their top five?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>SDKs can enable powerful in-app features with the corresponding APIs that will substantially affect your app’s user experience. With so many apps out there, you would want yours to stand out in the app market.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And of course, you just don’t want users to download your app; you would like them to keep and share it with their peers, creating a loyal fanbase for your application.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you are a brand and you aim to engage and retain your users, adding <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/remain-competitive-by-adding-social-features-to-your-app">social features with an SDK </a>to your app can help raise user engagement through <a href="https://www.amity.co/blog/building-your-in-app-community-why-it-matters">in-app groups.</a> Meanwhile, integrating chat SDK into your application can facilitate 1-on-1 conversations or group interactions, allowing you to host online communities.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-video">Video SDKs</a> can help you integrate in-app live streaming and stories to your product if you have an entertainment application.&nbsp; So whether it’s a sports event or a concert broadcasted in your app, this solution can help bring throngs of fans to use your application. On the other hand, if your SDK has a <a href="https://www.amity.co/products/amity-bots">chatbot</a> API that can collect user data, you can use the information you have to create a more personalized user experience, push tailored notifications, and deliver the right content to your users.<br></p><p>In conclusion, API and SDK, regardless of their differences, can both be beneficial for your application. Using SDK with the right APIs can create numerous possibilities to improve your application. Now is the time to find the best SDKs to enhance your in-app user experience, engagement, and retention.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>I made a control board for the Microsoft Sculpt wireless keyboard that converts it to wired USB, and now my favorite keyboard is even better.</p>

<figcaption>USB cable and reset button.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The QMK config is available at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware">@chadaustin/qmk_firmware</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/handwired/sculpt">keyboards/handwired/sculpt/</a>), and the PCB design files at <a href="https://github.com/chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb">@chadaustin/wired-sculpt-pcb</a>.</p>

<p>I’m planning on making at least one more, so if you’d like one, maybe I can help.</p>

<p>It’s a huge improvement. Latency is reduced by about 13 milliseconds, and with full control over the microcontroller’s firmware, you can customize keymaps and layers, and actually use the keyboard’s built-in LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Feel free to stop reading here — I am going to tell the sequence of events that led to this project. Besides some exposure to basic voltage and resistance circuits in college, I have very little electronics background. But, in a short time, I went from only barely knowing what a capacitor was to having a working PCB manufactured and assembled, and maybe this will inspire someone else to give it a try.</p>

<p>Since developing RSI in college, I’ve exclusively used Microsoft’s ergonomic keyboards. And when I first tried the Sculpt, I instantly knew it was the best yet. The soft actuation, short key travel, and rigid frame are perfect for my hands. And because the number pad is a separate device, the distance to my mouse is shortened.</p>

<p>My brother went out and bought one too. Not much later, he gave it to me, saying the latency was inconsistent and high, and it was unacceptable for gaming. I thought he was being uniquely sensitive, since I had no problem in either Linux, Windows 7, or macOS. But then I updated to Windows 10 and saw exactly what he meant.</p>

<p>It was like the keyboard would go to sleep if a key wasn’t pressed for a few seconds, and the first keypress after a wake would be delayed or, worse, dropped.</p>

<p>And heaven forbid I use my USB 3 hub, whose EMI would disrupt the 2.4 GHz signal, and <em>every other</em> keypress would be unreliable. I’d gone as far as mounting the wireless transceiver directly under my keyboard, on the underside of my desk, and keys were still dropped.</p>

<p>So, best keyboard ever. But wireless sucks. (But mostly in Windows 10? No idea about that.)</p>

<h2 id="over-the-hump">Over the Hump</h2>

<p>What started this whole thing is that the <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/eden/#edenfs">EdenFS</a> team was a bunch of keyboard enthusiasts. During the pandemic, as we’re all at home burning out and missing each other, we were trying to think of some virtual team offsites. Wez offered to walk everyone through building a <a href="https://www.1upkeyboards.com/instructions-downloads/sweet-16-instructions/">Sweet 16 Macro Pad</a>.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/sweet-16.jpeg" alt="Assembled Sweet 16 underside"></a>
<figcaption>Assembled Sweet 16 underside. This is take two, after resoldering and cleaning the whole thing. Take one was a bit of a mess.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, okay, a keyboard is a matrix, with some diodes used to disambiguate the signalling, and a microcontroller that rapidly polls the matrix and reports events over USB…</p>

<p>So maybe I could fix the Sculpt! I bought a transceiver-less Sculpt off eBay for cheap and <a href="http://emmanuelcontreras.com/how-to/how-to-disassemble-microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-and-make-it-wired/">popped it open (thanks Emmanuel Contreras!)</a>, thinking maybe its controller could be flashed with new firmware that speaks USB. The Sculpt uses a <a href="https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF24LE1_PS_v1.6.pdf">Nordic Semiconductor nRF24LE1</a>, but I was nowhere near capable of making use of that information at the time, though it did point me to Samy Kamkar’s horrifying guide on <a href="https://samy.pl/keysweeper/">surreptitiously sniffing keystrokes from nearby (older) Microsoft wireless keyboards</a>.</p>

<p>I almost gave up here, but Per Vognsen <a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1322422385174220800">suggested I scan the matrix myself</a> and it turns out Michael Fincham had already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/bhkgnp/modification_photos_qmk_wired_microsoft_sculpt/">mapped out the matrix and soldered a Teensy 2.0++ board onto the Sculpt’s test pads</a>, showing this was doable!</p>

<p>So I ordered my own microcontroller to try the same thing.</p>

<p>First, I bought an Arduino Pro Micro, like the Sweet 16 uses. Oh hey, 18 GPIO pins isn’t enough to drive the Sculpt’s 26-pin matrix. I looked at using an I2C GPIO expander, but it felt like taking on too much.</p>

<figcaption>Arduino Pro Micro. Wait, you need pins to scan a matrix?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>More pins? QMK’s Proton C has more pins! So I carefully soldered onto the test pads as Michael had shown was possible… and it worked!</p>

<figcaption>All test pads connected to Proton C. It works!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Getting those wires to stick to the pads without shorting was tricky. (I hadn’t yet discovered how magical flux is.)</p>

<p>The keyboard worked, but I couldn’t fit the board, its wires, and the new microcontroller into the case, and I wasn’t <em>really</em> happy leaving it in this state, even if I could pack it in somehow.</p>

<p>I thought, all I <em>really</em> need is the ribbon cable connector, so I ordered a 30 pin, 1.0 mm pitch ribbon breakout and the pricier (but tons of pins!) <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy 2.0++</a>. Looking back, it’s cute that I was trying to save $10 on the microcontroller… You just have to get used to spending money on whatever saves you time.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/breakout-and-teensy.jpeg" alt="Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++"></a>
<figcaption>Ribbon cable breakout and Teensy 2.0++</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, it was almost as annoying to solder, and still didn’t fit. So much for saving money on microcontrollers.</p>

<p>I thought about giving up. Is it really that bad that my keys don’t always register in games? Can I just tolerate some flakiness and latency?</p>

<p>But Jon Watte offered to spend an entire day showing me how to use KiCad, design circuits, layout PCBs, select components on Digi-Key, scan datasheets for the important information, and how to work with a PCB manufacturing house. Of course you never turn down opportunities like that.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---schematic">Designing the Final Board - Schematic</h2>

<p>Assuming, like me, you’ve never done this, I’ll summarize the steps.</p>

<p>First you sketch out the circuit schematic.</p>

<figure>
<a href="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png"><img src="https://chadaustin.me/images/sculpt/schematic.png" alt="Schematic"></a>
<figcaption>Schematic in KiCad. Most of this was informed by the datasheet and Atmel's design guides.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jon showed me several tricks in KiCad, like global labels, and starting with some standard resistor and capacitor values, but it’s very important that you go through the datasheets, because details can matter a ton.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted the main processor to be the AT90USB1286 controller, and fortunately KiCad already had a symbol for it. Atmel has a comprehensive and accessible data sheet, which showed me I needed some 22 Ω resistors on the USB data lines, which of the ISP programmer lines needed resistors (and appropriate values), and that I needed to either pull HWB low, or provide a physical switch that pulls it low, in order to allow rebooting the device into USB firmware update mode.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of things that are implicitly known to electrical engineers but that were new to me. You want:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a ground plane under the data lines and most of the microcontroller if possible.</li>
  <li>an electrolytic or tantalum bypass capacitor on the main 5V power from USB.</li>
  <li>ceramic filter capacitors on each power pin.</li>
  <li>appropriate values for the resonance capacitors on your crystal.</li>
  <li>electrostatic discharge protection! Turns out transients are common and it’s easy to fry a chip just by plugging it in.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then when you get into concerns like EMI and high-frequency signal integrity, the rabbit hole goes deep.</p>

<p>I kept having to tell myself “it’s just a keyboard”, but it also helped that there are a great number of high-quality resources on these topics just a click away. I spent lots of time on <a href="https://www.eevblog.com/">EEVBlog</a>.</p>

<p>Before finishing the circuit design, Jon had me do a couple smart things. In case the factory-supplied USB bootloader didn’t work out, he suggested I add the footprint (but not a connector!) for an ISP programmer and a debug LED to prove code would work at all.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-final-board---physical-layout">Designing the Final Board - Physical Layout</h2>

<p>After arranging the schematic and ensuring it passed the electrical rules check, it was time to pick specific components. That is, the reference to a 220 Ω resistor is replaced with the Panasonic ERJ-3EKF2200V, 0603 surface mount.</p>

<p>There are a couple things to keep in mind. For common components, like resistors and ceramic capacitors, there is a huge amount of choice. For example, I see over 1400 surface-mount 220 Ω resistors on digikey. I tried to just stick with one high-quality brand like Panasonic or Samsung for all of that stuff.</p>

<p>The important thing is the physical form factor, which determines the footprint on the board. Once you pick a part, it has a size, and you need to tell KiCad which physical footprint should be assigned to that component. I used 0603 resistors, so I assigned each resistor in the schematic the “Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric” footprint.</p>

<p>Same for everything else. Jon showed me how to draw my own footprints, but to avoid complexity, I was able to find appropriate footprints in KiCad’s standard libraries for every component I needed.</p>

<p>When you import the schematic into Pcbnew, it’s time to figure out where things go. Where are the edges of the board? Make careful measurements here. Where do the mounting holes go? Where do you want 
the microcontroller? Where do you want the USB port?</p>

</figure>

<p>Also, you have to pick through-hole sizes and trace widths. Jon had me use .250 mm for the narrow traces and .500 mm for the wider ones, presumably from experience. I used the narrow traces for signalling and wide traces for power, though I’ve since heard it’s a good idea to use narrow traces between filter capacitors and VBUS.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, there’s some iteration between the schematic and the PCB. After physically placing the ribbon cable connector and MCU, the traces all crossed over each other, so I had to reassign all the pins so it made sense physically.</p>

<p>There are also physical constraints about how USB data lines are run, and how the electrostatic protection chip wants to be placed for the most protection.</p>

<p>So, as simple as this board is, I spent a fair amount of time getting all of that right.</p>

<p>I found myself getting lost in the abstractness of holes and traces and footprints, so it was helpful to ground myself by occasionally loading the PCB in KiCad’s 3D viewer.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In this article, we share empirical measurements from our experiments in using Postgres to index and search over 10,000 top GitHub repositories using <code>pg_trgm</code> on only a Macbook.</p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://devlog.hexops.com/2021/postgres-trigram-search-learnings">“Postgres Trigram search learnings”</a>, in which we shared several learnings and beliefs about trying to use Postgres Trigram indexes as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”).</p>

<p>We share our results, as well as <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements">the exact steps we performed, scripts, and lists of the top 20,000 repositories by stars/language on GitHub</a> so you can reproduce the results yourself should you desire.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p><strong>This article is extensive and more akin to a research paper than a blog post.</strong> If you’re interested in our conclusions, see <a href="#conclusions">conclusions</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We wanted to get empirical measurements for how suitable Postgres is in providing regexp search over documents, e.g. as an alterative to Google’s <a href="https://github.com/google/zoekt">Zoekt</a> (“Fast trigram based code search”). In specific:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many repositories can we index on just a 2019 Macbook Pro?</li>
  <li>How fast are different regexp searches over the corpus?</li>
  <li>What Postgres 13 configuration gives best results?</li>
  <li>What other operational effects need consideration if seriously attempting to use Postgres as the backend for a regexp search engine?</li>
  <li>What is the best database schema to use?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>We ran all tests on a 2019 Macbook Pro with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9</li>
  <li>16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4</li>
</ul>

<p>During test execution, few other Mac applications were in use such that effectively all CPU/memory was available to Postgres.</p>

<h2 id="corpus">Corpus</h2>

<p>We scraped <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/tree/main/top_repos">lists of the top 1,000 repositories from the GitHub search API</a> ranked by stars for each of the following languages (~20.5k repositories in total):</p>

<ul>
  <li>C++, C#, CSS, Go, HTML, Java, JavaScript, MatLab, ObjC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Shell, Solidity, Swift, TypeScript, VB .NET, and Zig.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloning all ~20.5k repositories in parallel took ~14 hours with a fast ~100 Mbps connection to GitHub’s servers.</p>

<h3 id="dataset-reduction">Dataset reduction</h3>

<p>We found the amount of disk space required by <code>git clone --depth 1</code> on these repositories to be a sizable ~412G for just 12,148 repositories - and so we put in place several processes for further reduce the dataset size by about 66%:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removing <code>.git</code> directories resulted in a 30% reduction (412G -&gt; 290G, for 12,148 repositories)</li>
  <li>Removing files &gt; 1 MiB resulted in another 51% reduction (290G -&gt; 142G, for 12,148 repositories - note GitHub does not index files &gt; 384 KiB in their search engine)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-insertion">Database insertion</h2>

<p>We <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/cmd/corpusindex/main.go">concurrently inserted</a> the entire corpus into Postgres, with the following DB schema:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>pg_trgm</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>files</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>bigserial</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
    <span>contents</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
    <span>filepath</span> <span>text</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In total, this took around ~8 hours to complete and Postgres’s entire on-disk utilization was 101G.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-trigram-index">Creating the Trigram index</h2>

<p>We tried three separate times to index the dataset using the following GIN Trigram index:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS files_contents_trgm_idx ON files USING GIN (contents gin_trgm_ops);
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>In the first attempt, we hit an OOM after 11 hours and 34 minutes.</strong> This was due to a rapid spike in memory usage at the very end of indexing. We used a <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements#configuration-attempt-1-indexing-failure-oom">fairly aggressive</a> Postgres configuration with a very large max WAL size, so it was not entirely unexpected.</li>
  <li><strong>In the second attempt, we ran out of SSD disk space after ~27 hours</strong>. Notable is that the disk space largely grew towards the end of indexing, similar to when we faced an OOM - it was not a gradual increase over time. For this attempt, we used the excellent <a href="https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/#/">pgtune</a> tool to reduce our first Postgres configuration as follows:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>shared_buffers = 4GB → 2560MB
effective_cache_size = 12GB → 7680MB
maintenance_work_mem = 16GB → 1280MB
default_statistics_target = 100 → 500
work_mem = 5242kB → 16MB
min_wal_size = 50GB → 4GB
max_wal_size = 4GB → 16GB
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 8 → 4
max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8 → 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In our third and final attempt, we cut the dataset in half and indexing succeeded after 22 hours.</strong> In specific, we deleted half of the files in the database (from 19,441,820 files / 178GiB of data to 9,720,910 files / 82 GiB of data.) The Postgres configuration used was the same as in attempt 2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-memory-usage">Indexing performance: Memory usage</h2>

<p>In our first attempt, we see the reported <code>docker stats</code> memory usage of the container grow up to 12 GiB (chart shows MiB of memory used over time):</p>

<p><img width="981" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313722-56bbac80-6a50-11eb-94c7-8e13ea095053.png"></p>

<p>In our second and third attempts, we see far less memory usage (~1.6 GiB consistently):</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314104-350ef500-6a51-11eb-909f-2f1b524d29b2.png"></p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315387-ce3f0b00-6a53-11eb-886c-410f000f73bd.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-cpu-usage">Indexing performance: CPU usage</h2>

<p>Postgres’ Trigram indexing appears to be mostly single-threaded (at least when indexing <em>a single table</em>, we test multiple tables later.)</p>

<p>In our first attempt, CPU usage for the container did not rise above 156% (one and a half virtual CPU cores):</p>

<p><img width="982" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107313915-cc277d00-6a50-11eb-9282-62159a127966.png"></p>

<p>Our second attempt was around 150-200% CPU usage on average:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107314168-507a0000-6a51-11eb-8a18-ec18752f7f16.png"></p>

<p>Our third attempt similarly saw an average of 150-200%, but with a brief spike towards the end to ~350% CPU:</p>

<p><img width="980" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107315239-8324f800-6a53-11eb-9a5b-fcc61d1a7b59.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-io">Indexing performance: Disk IO</h2>

<p>Disk reads/writes during indexing averaged about ~250 MB/s for reads (blue) and writes (red). Native in-software tests show the same Macbook able to achieve read/write speeds of ~860 MB/s with &lt;5% affect on CPU utilization.</p>

<p><small>Addition made Feb 20, 2021:</small> We ran tests using native Postgres as well (instead of in Docker with a bind mount) and found better indexing and query performance, more on this below.</p>

<p><img width="599" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/106507903-ec6f9e80-6488-11eb-88a8-78e5b7aacfd6.png"></p>

<h2 id="indexing-performance-disk-space">Indexing performance: Disk space</h2>

<p>The database contains 9,720,910 files totalling 82.07 GiB:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>postgres=# select count(filepath) from files;
  count  
---------
 9720910
(1 row)

postgres=# select SUM(octet_length(contents)) from files;
     sum     
-------------
 88123563320
(1 row)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Before indexing</strong>, we find that all of Postgres is consuming 54G:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 54G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After <code>CREATE INDEX</code>, Postgres uses:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ du -sh .postgres/
 73G	.postgres/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, the index size for 82 GiB of text is 19 GiB (or 23% of the data size.)</p>

<h2 id="database-startup-times">Database startup times</h2>

<p>From an operational standpoint, it is worth noting that if Postgres is starting clean (i.e. previous shutdown was graceful) then startup time is almost instantaneous: it begins accepting connections immediately and loads the index as needed.</p>

<p>However, if Postgres experienced a non-graceful termination during e.g. startup, it can take a hefty ~10 minutes with this dataset to start as it goes through an automated recovery process.</p>

<h2 id="queries-executed">Queries executed</h2>

<p>In total, we executed 19,936 search queries against the index. We chose queries which we expect give reasonably varying amounts of coverage over the trigram index (that is, queries whose trigrams are more or less likely to occur in many files):</p>

<h2 id="query-performance-vs-planning-time">Query performance vs. planning time</h2>

<p>The following scatter plot shows how 79% of queries executed in under 3s (Y axis, in ms), while Postgres’s query planner had planned them for execution in under 100-250ms generally (X axis, in ms):</p>

<p><img width="1252" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848471-ef379100-6db0-11eb-8396-4d156a179aae.png"></p>

<p>If we expand the view to include all queries, we start to get a picture of just how outlier these 21% of queries are (note that the small block of dots in the bottom left represents the same diagram shown above):</p>

<p><img width="1250" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848517-3cb3fe00-6db1-11eb-9652-e65d7d88fe36.png"></p>

<h2 id="query-time-vs-cpu--memory-usage">Query time vs. CPU &amp; Memory usage</h2>

<p>The following image shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(top) Query time in milliseconds</li>
  <li>(middle) CPU usage percentage (e.g. 801% refers to 8 out of 16 virtual CPU cores being consumed)</li>
  <li>(bottom) Memory usage in MiB.</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="1255" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107848716-efd12700-6db2-11eb-8e8b-a8141a6bdb0b.png"></p>

<p>Notable insights from this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The large increase in resource usage towards the end is when we began executing queries with no <code>LIMIT</code>.</li>
  <li>CPU usage does not exceed 138%, until the spike at the end.</li>
  <li>Memory usage does not exceed 42 MiB, until the spike at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>We suspect <code>pg_trgm</code> is single-threaded within the scope of a single table, but with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-partitioning.html">table data partitioning</a> (or splitting data into multiple tables with subsets of the data), we suspect better parallelism could be achieved.</p>

<h2 id="investigating-slow-queries">Investigating slow queries</h2>

<p>If we plot the number of index rechecks (X axis) vs. execution time (Y axis), we can clearly see one of the most significant aspects of slow queries is that they have many more index rechecks:</p>

<p><img width="1036" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/107849660-fc0cb280-6db9-11eb-9c10-cb7e74366ab7.png"></p>

<p>And if we look at <a href="https://github.com/hexops/pgtrgm_emperical_measurements/blob/main/query_logs/query-run-3.log#L3-L24">the <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> output for one of these queries</a> we can also confirm <code>Parallel Bitmap Heap Scan</code> is slow due to <code>Rows Removed by Index Recheck</code>.</p>

<h2 id="table-splitting">Table splitting</h2>

<p>Splitting up the search index into multiple smaller tables seems like an obvious approach to getting <code>pg_trgm</code> to use multiple CPU cores. We tried this by taking the same exact data set and splitting it into 200 tables, and found …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is the first post in this blog, it was published on February 19, 2021.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>The year of 2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, the BLM movement, and the U.S. elections among other billion of things around the globe. It is funny I even mention the third one considering how little I give a damn about U.S. politics, yet this whole story begins with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler">Parler</a> deplatforming that happened about a month ago. Let me remind you: Apple, Google, Amazon, and a few other companies terminated their service to the free speech social network for insufficient moderation effectively destroying the platform in a matter of just a couple of days. What the fuck?</p>

<p>OK, let me be clear with my position: I believe every private company has a right to refuse service to anyone, whether an individual or a business, but I also have my own right to despise them for exercising that. What they did was probably legal, but screw them anyway, they failed us. Regardless what these psychopathic corporations like to tell the public, they are only concerned with maximizing shareholder value, and if there is anything  even remotely resembling an image liability (through pressure by political radicals, cancel culture SJWs, you name it), they will not think twice. What disgusts me the most here is neither greed nor hypocrisy but their unwillingness to grow a pair of balls and stand up for freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You see, freedom of speech and expression must be absolute. You cannot have censorship-resistance with exceptions; otherwise, these exceptions could be used to remove or block anything unwanted, not only offensive. This way, the Chinese cannot access Wikipedia because of what originally started as a counter-terrorism measure, and the Russians cannot access LinkedIn because of what originally started as a children protection measure. We cannot deprive humanity of their freedom just because some small fraction of users might, unfortunately, use that freedom to spread offensive content. In the same way, you do not ban electricity because people get electrocuted.</p>

<p>Let us now switch from corporates to governments. Ooh, wee! Do not even get me started on that. And I am not even talking about cases like Google happily not letting people disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SafeSearch">SafeSearch</a> in Indonesia because its government knows best, that is just the tip of the iceberg. I am talking about political censorship which includes silencing people with torture, gulags, and bullets. Here is the world map of the freedom of the press status:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/press-freedom.png" alt="2020 Press Freedom Index"></p>

<p>Just look at this mess. Blue tones mean OK-ish, others not so much. This map is <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:NordNordWest">NordNordWest</a>’s work based on the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">2020 Press Freedom Index</a> and is distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/legalcode">CC BY-SA 3.0 de</a>. Keep in mind population densities, e.g. there are about 90 times more people per unit area living in Vietnam than Australia. I am actually surprised the U.S. did so well in 2020 considering how badly they wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Mr. Assange</a> to be extradited and executed.</p>

<p>What would you answer your children if they asked you how in the world North Korea still exists in its current form with 25 million Koreans suffering for over 70 years and no one is doing anything about that? Or how about 28 million people in Venezuela? Or 82 million people in Iran? Giving voice to all whistleblowers and activists, especially the ones risking their lives and freedom in hostile environments is the fundamental goal of Pepe.</p>

<h3 id="darknets">Darknets</h3>

<p>There is already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet">Freenet</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNUnet">GNUnet</a> etc. We can run emails, message boards, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kad_network">Kad</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> on top of them, maybe even use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum</a> smart contracts for decentralized computing. All the technology is there, why bother with something new? Well, first of all, these are all amazing projects, there is nothing wrong with them. The peculiar thing, however, is none of them except BitTorrent (and perhaps Tor) gained much popularity, neither do we see any readily available censorship-resistant communication platforms. Why is that?</p>

<p>I claim there are 2 main reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are hard to use. The “Unix is user-friendly, it is just picky about who its friends are.” aphorism still lives in most them: you may need to install a bunch of additional software (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">JVM</a> or shared libraries) potentially dealing with a dependency hell on some platforms; read through sparse documentation and dead forums on optimal network, security, and sharing settings; carefully configure your router, computer, and client; install, study, and configure applications running on top of the darknet, i.e. repeat the steps. The reason why Tor became popular outside of research was not because it was first, but because of the hacky all-in-one Tor Browser Bundle with sane defaults.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They prefer purity to practicality. Instead of concentrating manpower on few specific use cases, most existing tools try to conquer the world: a new internet, interplanetary, infrastructure, an application framework, APIs, a Turing-complete language on the blockchain etc. This is great and all, it is general, conceptual, modular, extensible, and stackable—everything we like—but sometimes overengineering is just overengineering given the goal. And our goal here is not to make a technical revolution, but to help as many people as we can communicate without fear of retribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>BitTorrent evolved into something that is used by 150 million people worldwide, it seamlessly adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">PEX</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">µTP</a>, trackerless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet links</a>, and people do not even know what the hell it all means. Even though proprietary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> thrived very similarly (at least before it was crippled by Microsoft), millions of its users did not even know what peer-to-peer meant, not to mention how it worked under the hood, it just did. These two systems succeeded not because of luck but rather as a result of some excellent product decisions. We need to learn from that and reiterate.</p>

<h2 id="pepe-overview">Pepe overview</h2>

<h3 id="user-level">User level</h3>

<p>For the messaging platform, I chose to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">imageboard</a> similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan">4chan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futaba_Channel">Futaba Channel</a>. While not the most popular type of forum, imageboards are extremely flexible and free of junk like authentication or karma, they promote anonymity in a very practical way, and over 30 million people are already familiar with them. Perhaps, I am not a big fan of their crowded old-school design, but the initial user traction is more important than my sense of beauty, we will refine the looks through time.</p>

<p>That is, the Pepe imageboard is going to be the only application running on top the Pepe darknet, they are in fact inseparable. This way, we can design the network specifically for this one use case. This brings both security and performance benefits. Joining the darknet can be as simple as double clicking the application, and users do not need to install or configure any third-party browsers or proxy servers, they can just go to <a href="http://localhost:8666/">localhost:8666</a> using Chrome, Safari, or whatever they like, and it is going to be safe without any third-party extensions.</p>

<p>Once online, users may browse existing or create new message boards about various topics in any language such as <code>/en/food/</code> or <code>/ja/math/</code>. A board is a collection of threads about something more specific, would it be an idea or a question. A thread has a collection of posts that people send replying to each other. Each post may have one or multiple attachments such as photos, videos, you name it. So that you have an idea of what it looks like, here is a screenshot of a random thread on the 4chan DIY board:</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/4chan-thread.png" alt="4chan thread"></p>

<p>What is fundamentally different with Pepe is moderation. Instead of relying on a centralized entity with a banhammer, each board and thread owner may anonymously moderate their spaces on their own. However, nothing can actually be deleted, it can only be shadowed, and each user decides whether they want to see the light or the full version of the page at any moment in time. People can still reply to shadowed posts inside their own shadowed posts, so no one cannot silence anyone, only maintain order on the light side.</p>

<p>If people are no longer interested in particular threads, they will eventually become forgotten by the network and naturally disappear from their board. But if there is at least one person who is subscribed to or has archived some thread, no one in the world (even Pepe creators) can censor or somehow shut it down without hurting most of the network Pepe is running on top of.</p>

<h3 id="network-level">Network level</h3>

<p>The three biggest problems with 4chan and similar communication platforms are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They use closed source software so no one can tell how secure everything is and what is really going on there.</li>
  <li>They are centralized, i.e. some individual or business owns the servers and fully controls the whole infrastructure.</li>
  <li>They collect lots of metadata including but not limited to “someone with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP address</a> posted this at this moment in time”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigating the first problem is the easiest: just use open-source software whenever possible. Regarding the centralization issue, we could switch to a decentralized solution like BitTorrent (imagine each torrent containing a thread with its posts and attachments), but that itself does not help with privacy, people can still see what others are doing. Similarly, we could tackle the privacy issue with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> or a darknet like Tor or I2P, but that, contrary to popular belief, does not solve the centralization issue in any way. Clearly, we need the best of the two worlds. Let us fuse them together!</p>

<p><img src="https://1b677b8f8bb20100.github.io/introduction/pepe-routing.png" alt="Pepe routing"></p>

<p>Here is an very simplified walk through how the network works. Imagine Bob is an undercover journalist who wants to anonymously share his report and Alice is a political activist who is interested in the investigation Bob had been doing. It all starts with Bob announcing he has the report:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bob joins the network and gathers information about random peers on it through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>. This way, Bob discovers hundreds of participants including X and Y. Similarly, Bob registers himself on the network through the DHT so that others …</p></li></ol></div></div>

<p>Today, we’re changing our name from TransferWise to Wise.</p>
<p>Our customers now need us for more than money transfers. Sending, spending, and receiving money internationally is too expensive, slow, and inconvenient. We’re fixing that for people and businesses.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/world-meet-wise#transferwise-is-now-wise">skip ahead to see what changes for you</a> (spoiler: not much, right away), but first, let’s go back a bit.</p>
<h2><a href="#a-decade-into-our-mission" id="a-decade-into-our-mission"></a>A decade into our mission</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, Taavet and I set out to fix international money transfers for all of us who’d been overcharged and underserved by banks. We named our idea ‘TransferWise’ — because our early customers were ‘wise’ to know their banks were charging hidden fees in exchange rate markups.</p>
<p>We set ourselves a mission to make money work without borders — to make money move instantly, transparently, conveniently, and — eventually — for free.</p>
<p>Now, we’re a community of 10 million like-minded people and businesses managing money all over the world, saving billions and fighting as hard as ever against hidden fees.</p>
<p>Our multi-currency account and the clever debit card is replacing international banking for many of you. By building this infrastructure for you, we’ve created a platform that more than a dozen banks use today.</p>
<p>You’ve told us for years the problem is bigger than money transfers. Any time money moves into another currency, it’s still a maze of hidden exchange rate markups, high fees, delays, and small print.</p>
<h2><a href="#well-fix-international-banking-together" id="well-fix-international-banking-together"></a>We’ll fix international banking together</h2>
<p>Sending, spending, receiving, and holding money internationally doesn’t work like it should, because the international banking system was built for the past.</p>
<p>For generations, banks have been defined by borders. Traditional bank accounts trap our money in one country, making international lives more difficult and expensive than they need to be. We shouldn’t have to accept this status quo.</p>
<p>Today, we don’t. We’ll fix it with Wise — the world’s most international account. It makes your money borderless — with instant, super-cheap money transfers, a debit card to spend in any currency, account details to get paid in 30+ countries, balances to hold your money safely in 50+ different currencies, multi-currency direct debits, and other revolutionary features.</p>
<h2><a href="#transferwise-is-now-wise" id="transferwise-is-now-wise"></a>TransferWise is now Wise</h2>
<p>Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for — a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. Wise is for all of us who live, work, travel, or support family around the world. It’s for those of us who want to cut out the middlemen that hold us back from being truly borderless.</p>
<p>For customers, not too much will change right away. We become “Wise” or “Wise Business” — depending how you use us. You can access your exact same account via <a href="http://wise.com/">wise.com</a>, using your current email and password. You won't need a new account. In a few weeks we will start to redirect transferwise.com to wise.com.</p>
<p>Our logo has changed, and our apps will be renamed. But our icon — the fast flag — remains as a symbol for money without borders. Beyond that, you’ll notice some new colours, words, and designs.</p>
<p>The core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.</p>
<p>We’re humbled that 10 million of you already rely on us to help you lead your international lives. We can’t wait to bring the next 100 million of you with us as we continue to build a new, fair, and transparent world of money.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>

      <p>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.</p>

<p><img src="https://joshwithers.blog/uploads/2021/7f4522c3f4.jpg"></p>

<p>That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?</p>

<p>So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</p>

<p>And TransLink, the local public transport provider, had neglected to renew the domain name used in the NFC tag.</p>

<p>I now own the <a href="http://transl.in/">transl.in</a> domain name and the people of the Gold Coast now have easy access to my website. 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>As an example, a local bus stop links to <a href="http://transl.in/k_300428">http://transl.in/k_300428</a></p>

However, what if there were languages that were not created to be used? Ones that test the boundaries of programming language design and cause even the most experienced programmers to bang their heads against the wall trying to build a simple program? Enter esoteric programming languages.<h2>What Are Esoteric Programming Languages?</h2> Most programming languages are designed for the purpose of widespread use and productivity. However, Esoteric programming languages (esolang) are a segment of programming languages that are not built for usability, but rather for entertainment, artistic intent, or to prove a concept. The word "esoteric" is <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/esoteric" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derived from the Greek word "esoterikos"</a>, which means “belonging to an inner circle”. Esoteric languages are not intended to be widely understood.<h2>The Purpose of Esoteric Languages</h2> The first-ever esoteric programming language was <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INTERCAL</a>. A parody created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_(programmer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Don Woods</a> and James M. Lyon in 1972 that mimicked popular languages at the time, such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/">COBOL.</a> The idea was later revived in 1993 when Wouter van Oortmerssen designed <a href="http://strlen.com/false-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FALSE</a>. The concept was to build a powerful, tiny implementation (compiler executable of 1024 bytes) programming language with an obfuscated syntax that was disorienting to its users. From here, more recognizable names such as <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainfuck</a> and <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Befunge</a> began to emerge and the concept of esoteric languages began to take shape as a concept.  As previously stated, esoteric languages have four main purposes. To act as a proof of concept, for competitive sport, display an artistic process and simply for entertainment. To better grasp these ideas, let's look into each of them with an example language.<h3>Proof of Concept (Brainfuck)</h3> The first purpose of esoteric languages we are going to look at is proof of concept. A language that was able to present a proof of concept to the computer science community was <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainfuck.</a> A minimalist programming language that contains an astonishing eight characters in total while still proving to be <a href="https://medium.com/@evinsellin/what-exactly-is-turing-completeness-a08cc36b26e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing-complete</a>. The language should not be used for practical projects due to its complexity at scale (as the name suggests). However, it is interesting to see that a programming language can have its utilities with such a small amount of primitives. Here is an example of the language:  <h3>Competitive (Malbolge)</h3> Esoteric languages can also be viewed in a competitive context, such as Malbolge. Languages like Malbolge were created with the sole intent to be exceptionally incomprehensible and difficult to use. Achieved through self-modification, non-intuitive operators and encryption, Malbolge is one of the hardest programming languages to learn. It also very well could be the first of its kind for this purpose in mind. The competition revolving around Malbolge is contained within the premise of the language. That anyone able to make a useful program with Malbolge deserves bragging rights. Here's a sample of how difficult the language is to use.  <h3>Artistic (Shakespeare)</h3> The third purpose of esolang's are for artistic purposes. A popular example of this is the <a href="http://shakespearelang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shakespeare language</a>. A unique programming language that is meant to resemble the writing from Shakespearean plays. The language is unique, as it redefines the entire programming paradigm. Instead of focusing on producing an intended result, the goal is to make the code itself look more elegant. If only all our code looked as clean as this!  <h3>Entertainment (COW)</h3> Finally, some esoteric programming languages are simply meant to be entertaining.&nbsp; Such as the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COW language by Sean Heber</a>. As a derivative of the Brainfuck language mentioned above, COW only has 12 primitive. All of which are different capitalizations of the word 'moo'. It's hard to imagine why someone would go through so much effort to create this language. In a way, this comical language really does grasp what programming is all about: incredibly frustrating, a little silly and most importantly, fun.  <h2>The Interesting Thing About Esoteric Languages</h2> So that's pretty much all you need to know about esoteric programming languages. In a strange way, they are like the 'conceptual art' of the programming world. Unconventional and weird, but often thought-provoking and fascinating. Esoteric languages break the recycled formula that most conventional languages follow. Making me believe that these languages could one day be the key to new applications of programming.  Although, if nothing else, they are fascinating designs to look at. Which remain untouched over years, without the over looming necessity to stay 'current' like the majority of popular languages today. Allowing them to only become more interesting with age.  You can check out a full list of esoteric programming languages, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Language_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment section below!

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Say you run an online book store and want to build a data pipeline that figures out who the top-selling authors are. Logically, the input to the pipeline is a log of every individual book purchase on the store for all time, along with details about each book like who authored it. And the output is a list of the top-selling authors per month.</p>

<!-- [image: book purchases + authorship info -> top-selling authors of the month] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>

    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The output of this data pipeline is a function of the input. In other words, the output is derived from the input by running the input through the pipeline.</p>

<!-- [image: f(input) -> output] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/f-input-output.png" width="400">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This is an important characteristic of the output. As long as the input data and pipeline transformations (i.e. the pipeline code) are preserved, the output can always be recreated. The input data is <em>primary</em>; if lost, it cannot be replaced. The output data, along with any intermediate stages in the pipeline, are <em>derivative</em>; they can always be recreated from the primary data using the pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="the-logical-view">The Logical View</h2>

<p>Let’s represent our hypothetical “Top-Selling Authors” pipeline as a directed graph, where the nodes represent datasets and the edges represent transformations of those datasets. Furthermore, let’s color each dataset in the graph based on whether it’s primary or derivative.</p>

<!-- [image: colored graph of transformations] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-graph.png" width="500">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Most data pipelines, if you zoom out far enough, look something like this. You have some source data; it gets sliced, diced, and combined in various ways to produce some outputs. If someone were to wipe out all the derived data in this pipeline, you’d be able to regenerate it without any data loss. The pipeline could include any number of arbitrary steps, like copying files from an FTP share, or scraping data from a web page. It doesn’t matter as long as the pipeline produces the same output when given the same input.</p>

<p>Any time someone queries the output of the pipeline, it’s logically equivalent to them running the entire pipeline on the source data to get the output they’re looking for. In this way, a pipeline is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/views/views?view=sql-server-ver15">view</a> into the source data.</p>

<h2 id="materializing-the-view">Materializing the View</h2>

<p>Of course, data pipelines don’t work this way in practice. It would be a waste of resources and a long wait for users if every query triggered a series of computations stretching all the way back to the primary data. When you ask for this month’s top-selling authors, you expect a quick response.</p>

<p>Hence, the typical real-world pipeline <em>materializes</em> its output, and often also several of the intermediate datasets required to produce that final output. Materializing a dataset simply means saving it to persistent storage, as opposed to repeatedly computing it on the fly. So when you ask for that list of authors, whatever system answering your query can start from the closest materialized dataset, as opposed to starting at the source or primary data.</p>

<!-- [image: cached nodes in graph colored; key explaining colors; caption] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>
        <img src="https://nchammas.com/assets/images/data-pipeline-materialized-view/pipeline-with-cached-nodes.png" width="500">
    </span>
    <figcaption>
    A query against dataset B only needs to recompute the pipeline starting from A, since A is materialized.
    All derivative datasets, whether materialized or not, can be thrown away and recreated from the primary data.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>So we’ve turned our view into a <em>materialized view</em>. “View” represents the logical transformations expressed in the pipeline. “Materialized” represents the fact that we cache the output of the pipeline, and perhaps also some of the intermediate steps. A complex set of interdependent data pipelines can be conceptualized in this way, as a graph of materialized views.</p>

<p>Note that this concept can be applied very broadly, and not just to what we think of as “normal” data pipelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A traditional web cache alleviates read traffic from the primary database, which is the source of truth. The cache is derivative and can be regenerated from the database at any time. The data in the cache is materialized so that incoming queries do not need to go all the way back to the database to get an answer.</li>
  <li>A build system compiles or assembles source code into artifacts like executables or test reports. The artifacts are derivative, whereas the source code is primary. When you run a program over and over, you reuse the artifacts output by your build system, as opposed to recompiling them from source every time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="updating-a-materialized-view">Updating a Materialized View</h2>

<p>Materializing the output, though a practical necessity for most pipelines, adds an administrative cost. When the source data changes, the materialized views need to be updated. Otherwise, the data you get from the view will be <em>stale</em>.</p>

<!-- [image: highlighted new source row; out-of-date output aggregation] -->

<div>
<figure>
    <span>

    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>To update a materialized view, there are two high-level properties you typically care about: the update <em>trigger</em>, and the update <em>granularity</em>. The former affects the freshness of your output, which impacts end-users of the data, and the latter affects the performance of your update process, which impacts the engineers or operators responsible for that process.</p>

<h3 id="update-trigger">Update Trigger</h3>

<p>The update trigger is the event that prompts a refresh of the materialized view—e.g. by running your pipeline against the latest source data.</p>

<p>That event may be a file landing in a shared drive, or some data arriving on an event stream, or another pipeline completing. For some pipelines, the update trigger may just be a certain time of day, in which case it might be more useful to talk about the update <em>frequency</em> rather than trigger.</p>

<p>A typical batch pipeline, for example, might run on a daily or hourly cadence, whereas a streaming pipeline may run every few seconds or minutes, or whenever a new event is delivered via some sort of event stream. Whenever the pipeline runs, it updates its output, and the whole process can be viewed as a <em>refresh</em> of the materialized view.</p>

<h3 id="update-granularity">Update Granularity</h3>

<p>The update granularity refers to how much of the materialized view needs to be modified to account for the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>A common update granularity is the full refresh. No matter how small or large the change to the source data, when the pipeline runs it throws away the entire output table and rebuilds it from scratch.</p>

<p>A more sophisticated pipeline might rebuild only a subset of the table, like a date partition. And an extremely precise pipeline may know how to update exactly the output rows that are impacted by the latest changes to the source data.</p>

<p>The update trigger and granularity are independent. You can have a pipeline that runs every second and does a full refresh of its output, and you can have a pipeline that runs once a day but carefully updates only the rows that it needs to.</p>

<h3 id="typical-examples">Typical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s explore these two properties a bit using our example pipeline that computes the top-selling authors of the month.</p>

<h4 id="the-daily-batch-update">The Daily Batch Update</h4>

<p>Every night at 1 a.m., an automated process looks for a dump of the latest purchases from the previous day. The dump is a compressed CSV file.</p>

<p>The update process uses this dump to recompute the month’s sales numbers for all authors. It replaces the entire output table with all-new calculations for all authors. Many of the authors’ numbers may not have changed since the last update (because they had no new sales in that time period), but they all get recomputed nonetheless.</p>

<p>This is a very typical example of a batch pipeline. It has a scheduled update trigger at 1 a.m. every night, and an update granularity of the entire output.</p>

<h4 id="the-live-updating-table">The Live-Updating Table</h4>

<p>In this version of our top-selling authors pipeline, individual purchases are streamed in as they happen, via a stream processor like Apache Kafka. Every purchase on this stream triggers an update to the calculation of top-selling authors.</p>

<p>The update process uses each individual purchase to incrementally recompute the sales total for the relevant author. If an author has no new sales over a given span of updates, their sales total is not recomputed (though their rank in the top-selling authors may need to be updated).</p>

<p>This is an example of a precise streaming pipeline. The update trigger is the purchase event that is streamed in, and the update granularity is the sales total for a single author.</p>

<h2 id="the-declarative-data-lake">The Declarative Data Lake</h2>

<p>We previously discussed the idea of conceptualizing your <a href="https://nchammas.com/writing/modern-data-lake-database">data lake as a database</a>. And here we’ve shown how you can conceptualize your data pipelines as materialized views.</p>

<p>But what if we could take this idea further than just as a conceptual tool? What if you could actually implement your data pipelines as a graph of materialized views?</p>

<p>Taken far enough, the promise of such an idea would be to build a <em>declarative data lake</em>, where the code that manages the lake focuses more on defining <em>what</em> the datasets are and less on <em>how</em> to mechanically build or update them.</p>

<p>Two relatively new projects express aspects of this vision in clear but different ways, and they merit some discussion here: <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> and <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dbt-pipelines-as-batch-updated-sql-queries">dbt: Pipelines as Batch-Updated SQL Queries</h3>

<p>The core of <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> is an engine for building <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction#what-makes-dbt-so-powerful">a graph of SQL queries</a>. Parts of any given query can be generated dynamically using a templating language (<a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/using-jinja/">Jinja</a>), and queries can reference other queries.</p>

<p>Every query has a configured materialization strategy, which defines whether the results of the query are generated ahead of time, and if so, how they are stored and updated.</p>

<p>If the results are materialized, they can be updated with a full refresh or <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/configuring-incremental-models/#understanding-incremental-models">incrementally</a>, though there are some restrictions on what kinds of updates can be done incrementally. Updates are typically triggered on a schedule.</p>

<h3 id="materialize-pipelines-as-live-updated-materialized-views">Materialize: Pipelines as Live-Updated Materialized Views</h3>

<p><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a> is an engine for building live, incrementally updated materialized views from streaming sources like Apache Kafka. A view can reference other live-updated views, as well as fixed tables.</p>

<p>The primary interface for creating these views is plain and elegant: A <a href="https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-materialized-view/"><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code></a> SQL statement.</p>

<p>Conceptually, this is roughly the same statement that is available in

			<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics says that&nbsp;you can have a particle spinning clockwise and counterclockwise at the same time – until you look at it, at which point it definitely becomes one or the other. The theory claims that&nbsp;observing reality fundamentally changes it.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics says that when you observe or interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it. At the very least, you are to blame for not doing <em>more</em>. Even if you don’t make the problem worse, even if you make it slightly better, the ethical burden of the problem falls on you as soon as you observe it. In particular, if you interact with a problem and benefit from it, you are a complete monster. I don’t subscribe to this school of thought, but it seems pretty popular.</p>
<hr>
<p>In 2010, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/nyregion/09placebo.html?_r=2&amp;hpAlways=&amp;pagewanted=all">New York randomly chose homeless applicants to participate in its Homebase program</a>, and tracked those who were not allowed into the program as a control group. The program was helping as many people as it could, the only change was explicitly labeling a number of people it wasn’t helping as a “control group”. The response?</p>
<blockquote><p>“They should immediately stop this experiment,” said the Manhattan borough president, <a title="More articles about Scott M. Stringer." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/scott_m_stringer/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Scott M. Stringer</a>. “The city shouldn’t be making guinea pigs out of its most vulnerable.”</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>On March 11th, 2012, the vast majority of people did nothing to help homeless people. They were busy doing other things, many of them good and important things, but&nbsp;by and large not improving the well-being of homeless humans in any way. In particular, almost no one was doing anything for the homeless of Austin, Texas. BBH Labs was an exception – they outfitted 13 homeless volunteers with WiFi hotspots and asked them to offer WiFi to SXSW attendees&nbsp;in exchange for donations. In return, they would be paid $20 a day plus whatever attendees gave in donations. Each of these 13 volunteers chose this over all the other things they could have done that day, and benefited from it – not a vast improvement, but significantly more than the 0 improvement that they were getting from most people.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/03/the-damning-backstory-behind-homeless-hotspots-at-sxswi/">response</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1">IT SOUNDS LIKE </span>something out of a <a href="http://nytsxsw.tumblr.com/post/19145988299/getting-a-decent-data-connection-at-sxsw-can-be-a">darkly satirical science-fiction dystopia</a>. But it’s absolutely real — and a completely problematic treatment of a problem that otherwise probably wouldn’t be mentioned in any of the panels at South by Southwest Interactive.</p></blockquote>
<p>There wouldn’t be any scathing editorials if BBH Labs had just chosen to do nothing – but they&nbsp;did something helpful-but-not-maximally-helpful, and thus are open to judgment.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are times when it’s almost impossible to get a taxi – when there’s inclement weather, when a large event is getting out, or when it’s just a very busy day. Uber attempts to solve this problem by introducing surge pricing – charging more when demand outstrips supply. More money means more drivers willing to make the trip, means more rides available. Now instead of having no taxis at all, people can choose between an expensive taxi or no taxi at all – a marginal improvement.&nbsp;Needless to say, Uber has been repeatedly lambasted for doing something instead of leaving the even-worse status quo the way it was.</p>
<hr>
<p>Gender inequality is a persistent, if hard to quantify, problem. <a href="http://blog.jaibot.com/?p=392">Last year I blogged</a> about how amoral agents could save money and drive the wage gap down to 0 by offering slightly less-sexist wages – while including some caveats about how it was probably unrealistic and we wouldn’t see anything like that in reality.&nbsp;So of course <em><strong>less than a week after I wrote that&nbsp;</strong></em><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/it-pro/business-it/evan-thornley-causes-stir-with-sexist-comments-at-sunrise-startup-conference-20140922-10kiku.html" target="_blank">Evan Thornley says</a>&nbsp;:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s a great arbitrage there, we would give [women] more responsibility and a greater share of the rewards than they were likely to get anywhere else and that was still often relatively cheap to someone less good of a different gender.”</p>
<p>While Mr Thornley said he wasn’t advocating that the gender pay gap should be perpetuated, he said it provided “an opportunity for forward thinking people”.</p>
<p>A number of online commentators, as well as Australian start-up blogs, have since said Mr Thornley’s comments were sexist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Thornley improved on the status quo – but in the process he interacted the problem and was thus caught up in it. This is a strategy which, if widely embraced, would practically eliminate&nbsp;many forms of wage discrimination overnight simply by harnessing something we have way too much of already: greed. So of course it was denounced.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last year the city of Detroit began to crack down on unpaid water bills, and thousands of poor people suddenly faced the prospect of having their water shut off. The vast majority of people did nothing to help them whatsoever. PETA did offer conditional help: If a family went vegan for 30 days, PETA would pay off their water bill, and throw in a basket of vegan food to boot. This was strictly more helpful than what 99.99999% of humanity was doing for Detroit residents at the time, as it didn’t make anything worse and offered a trade for anyone who valued 30 days of not-being-vegan less than however much they owed on their water bill. For marginally improving he situation instead of ignoring it, they were <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/07/24/3464033/peta-is-the-worst/" target="_blank">denounced as “the worst”</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Peter Singer has a famous thought experiment about a child&nbsp;drowning in a pond. I’ll let <a href="http://www.philosophybro.com/post/120721529553/peter-singers-drowning-child-argument" target="_blank">Philosophy Bro</a> explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like, let’s say I’m on my way to a bitchin’ party and I’m looking fly as shit and I smell good because <i>you already know</i>, and I’ve got a 30-rack of Natty because I’ll be goddamned if I show up empty-handed to the house I’m about to burn down. Once I get over this bridge, and turn the corner I’ve arrived and so has the party. Except I hear a bunch of splashing and I look over the bridge into the river and – fuck me – there’s a kid flailing around and calling for help, like he’s drowning for some reason instead of handling his shit like an adult.</p>
<p>I should save his life, right?</p>
<p>Sometimes in philosophy we like to ask obvious questions and waggle our eyebrows suggestively, like maybe you don’t exist after all, <i>hmm</i>? but bro, this is not one of those times. I should obviously jump in and SAVE THIS FUCKING CHILD’S LIFE. So I ruin a Polo and I don’t smell good anymore and a couple of the beers explode because I dropped them. Who gives a shit, right? A child was going to die.</p>
<p>…[snip]…</p>
<p>What if I told you that for $5, you could buy a life-saving vaccine for a child? Sure, he’s far away, but we already agreed: who gives a shit, right? It’ll still save his life, and it only costs you not having a fifth drink at the bar on a Thursday. Remember that $300 bar receipt you posted with the caption “just another Thursday night wearing matching plaid with my bros, we’re special and impressive and are the ACTUAL six dudes with the biggest dicks, unlike all you OTHER overconfidences of bros who think that, well guess what, it’s us?” What you were really saying was “I routinely pass up the chance to save two dozen lives with science so that I can black out and pretend that I like myself for a night.” That’s fucked up, bro.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference is that the drowning child has been definitively noticed, and thus her moral weight bears down on us and we have to save her. But children thousands of miles away? Not noticed!</p>
<p>I think this might be where a lot of the discomfort with talking about things we can do to alleviate suffering comes from. If you implicitly believe in the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics, then to confront the scope of suffering in the world is to make it your fault, and then if you don’t throw everything you have at the problem you’re as “bad” as PETA or Mr. Thornley or Uber or BBH Labs.</p>
<p>But what if – what if noticing a problem didn’t make it any worse? What if we could act on&nbsp;a problem and not feel horrible for making it just a little better, even if it was an action that benefited ourselves as well? What if we said that in these instances, these groups weren’t evil – it’s okay to notice a problem and only make it a little bit better. If everyone did that, the world would be a vastly better place. If everyone “exploited” opportunities where they could benefit and alleviate people’s suffering at the same time, we’d all be better off.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Today’s the day: We’re very proud to announce <a href="https://trussed.dev/">Trussed</a>®, an open source framework for modern cryptographic applications, which powers the FIDO and PIV authenticators of the Bee firmware on the new Solo V2 security key by SoloKeys.</p><p>It’s written in Rust.</p><p><img src="https://trussed.dev/images/uploads/trussed-square-200.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>This announcement will give a high-level overview of the motivation for and design of Trussed. It will be followed soon by a “tutorial” of sorts, walking through an <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed-totp-pc-tutorial">implementation of TOTP</a> (time-based one-time password, a commonly used second factor authentication method) in minimal form on PC.</p><p>We’re not just announcing, we’re also releasing the source code, dual-licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses, on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/">https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/</a>. This code is still very much a work in progress, and does not yet come with stable functionality or API promises. However, we think the time has come to continue further work in public, so we may learn from the open source community.</p><p>“We” here are not just SoloKeys, but also <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a>, our competitor-slash-collaborator from Germany that has always used SoloKeys firmware in their web authentication products, and will continue to do so. <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/" title="Nitrokey">Nitrokey</a> will have their own announcement on this topic and their further plans for security keys here.</p><p>Together, we loosely build the current “Trussed Alliance” of Trussed implementers, users, and evangelists. We are reachable by several means, for instance via email at <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a>, by Matrix chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#trussed:matrix.org">#trussed:matrix.org</a>, or async at <a href="https://github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions">github.com/trussed-dev/trussed/discussions</a>. We are very interested in and open to additional allies. Particularly, at this stage, those with strong (correct) opinions, and the drive to contribute to the implementation :)</p><h3 id="but-what-is-trussed">But what is Trussed?</h3><p>You may be aware of PKCS #11 (<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-ug/v2.40/pkcs11-ug-v2.40.html">usage guide</a>), which – despite all of its warts – is a standardized, high-level, platform-independent API, enabling software to make use of hardware-backed cryptography. There are other APIs in a similar spirit, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">WebCrypto</a> by the W3C (with its own warts, and notably relaying JavaScript applications to software implementations of cryptography), or <a href="https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec">PARSEC</a> (backed by Arm and Docker, which has a rather more grand scope).</p><p>All of these have in common that applications can outsource their cryptographic needs to a trusted third party implementation through a common API. Secret keys can be generated for various algorithms or mechanisms (symmetric cryptography such as AES, asymmetric cryptography such as P256, Ed25519, X25519, RSA, etc.). The application obtains not the sensitive key material, but instead a handle object, with which it can then perform further operations: sign data, verify signatures, encrypt or decrypt data, etc.</p><p>The core idea of Trussed is this: What if there were similar facilities – without the warts – right inside the firmware of embedded devices?</p><p>Thinking further: What if these were provided by idiomatic, misuse-resistant, best cryptographic practice-following APIs? What if the list of available cryptographic mechanisms, together with their software or hardware implementations, were flexibly configurable at compile time, but came with “batteries included”? What if this “crypto-in-a-box” would be easy to plug into whatever setup one is already using? What if applications, then, could focus on implementing their domain-specific logic and interfaces with the outside world, while taking advantage of <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html">one cryptographic joint, kept well oiled.</a></p><p>And that is exactly what Trussed is!</p><h3 id="portable-trussed-apps">Portable Trussed apps</h3><p>You may see the term “Trussed app”. By this we mean any unit of firmware that uses the Trussed APIs, and otherwise is completely cross-platform (meanwhile, it will be called externally by the runtime/scheduler). To repeat, a Trussed app is called externally, but internally only calls Trussed APIs – this makes it portable to all platforms on which Trussed itself runs on.</p><p>Two prime examples would be the FIDO and PIV authenticator apps by SoloKeys. In the past (with the existing Solo V1 key C firmware), when others wanted to “somehow reuse” app code it didn’t really work – forks happened, or even simple copy-pastes. Similarly, Google’s FIDO2 implementation in <a href="https://github.com/google/OpenSK">OpenSK</a> is tightly coupled to the Tock OS around it, and limited to devices which have Tock OS support.</p><p>By decoupling from runtimes, and making minimal requirements on Trussed platforms, we envision that “Trussed apps” will be shareable between vendors (each adding their own runtime and physical product). That bug fixes and functionality additions can be shared. That alternative implementations of existing applications are possible (e.g., a <a href="https://github.com/dicekeys/seeding-webauthn">DiceKeys</a>-backed FIDO2 app).</p><p>Generally, we would like to open up an ecosystem of “Trussed apps” (WireGuard, password managers, GPG for those that like it, pocket HSMs, etc.), eventually replacing JavaCard and bringing embedded cryptographic firmware to the modern age.</p><h3 id="trussed-components">Trussed Components</h3><p>There are two major components in Trussed, the service, and the clients.</p><p>The service depends on platform resources (storage, entropy, UI facilities), bundles up cryptographic algorithm implementations at compile time, and is then just a beefy component with a “process” method. This method needs to be called by the runtime/scheduler, either regularly, or on-demand via a provided syscall abstraction.</p><p>The service’s storage is partitioned by client, and further by type of object the service is responsible for managing on a client’s behalf: A key store for cryptographic keys, a file store for binary metadata (exposed as a POSIX-ish filesystem interface), and a certificate store.</p><p>The clients correspondingly have APIs (for crypto, file and other needs) to send requests with, for instance a “CryptoClient + P256 + HmacSha256”. Client and service communicate via <a href="https://docs.rs/interchange">interchanges</a>, shared memory areas in which requests and replies are placed. Both the requests and replies are modeled as Rust types, so there is no low-level memory copying and length calculations. Additionally, interchanges serve as a strong demarcation between different privileged executions (such as the secure and nonsecure worlds in ARM TrustZone).</p><h3 id="what-is-trussed-not">What is Trussed not?</h3><p>Trussed intends to be a configurable box you can use with ease in your firmware, but it does not intend to take over your entire platform. It is not an embedded operating system. Trussed does not use the heap, all variables are allocated on the stack. Trussed does not internally use threads in any way, control flow is linear and predictable.</p><p>To create a functional product, besides a Trussed platform, you need to supply:</p><ul><li>runtime/scheduler: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://rtic.rs/">RTIC</a> (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency), which is a thin software wrapper around the Arm Cortex-M NVIC hardware scheduler. Conceivably, something like <a href="https://www.tockos.org/">Tock</a> should work, or threaded scheduling on PC</li><li>interfaces: with SoloKeys, we use <a href="https://docs.rs/usb-device">usb-device</a> as a framework to implement USB classes (CTAPHID, CCID) on top of our <a href="https://github.com/lpc55/lpc55-hal">LPC55 HAL</a> (hardware abstraction layer), and our own NFC device framework</li><li>dispatch: depending on the richness of the runtime, there may be separate need to dispatch between multiple interfaces and multiple applications</li><li>secure manufacturing: Trussed has the concept of “device attestation”, binding a unique identifier for the chip it runs on to private device attestation keys (Ed255 + P256), via a vendor certificate authority. Further it has a concept of “key attestation”, attesting keys on the device as being generated on the device and not being extractable, via the device attestation keys and certificates. While Trussed exposes methods to do this, they rely on preparations that depend on the platform and need to be done in the manufacturing process.</li><li>optionally, a secure signed firmware update procedure: conceivably, Trussed might be used in a custom bootloader, but the compile-time security of Trussed comes from firmware “bundles” being verified by a vendor. There needs to be a way to ensure any changes to the firmware are “atomic” and authorized, replacing the entire bundle of runner + apps + Trussed with a new non-compromised setup (operating on the existing data).</li></ul><h3 id="first-implementation">First Implementation</h3><p>SoloKeys <a href="https://solokeys.com/blogs/news/our-solo-v2-campaign-launches-on-january-26th">will be releasing the first products built with Trussed</a>. Their Solo v2 authenticators are fully open source and designed for enterprise use for FIDO2 and PIV. More applications are to follow, all based on Trussed.</p><p><img src="https://trussed.dev/images/uploads/solov2.png" alt="Solo V2" title="Solo V2"></p><h3 id="what-about-the-trademark">What about the trademark?</h3><p>To conclude, we would like to explain why Trussed sometimes has a registered trademark symbol next to it. First off, as mentioned, the source code itself is permissively dual-licensed. There is no intent for any “open core” kind of license/monetization scheme (some reasoning that resonates is <a href="https://250bpm.com/blog:15/">here</a>). We consider the ideas expressed in Trussed to be public domain, and really just an (ongoing) distillation of best practices.</p><p>However, when a vendor wishes to sell a product, and advertise that it is “Built on Trussed”, has “Trussed® Inside”, or similar (in effect, profit from the trust we will build in Trussed!), we would like to be able to ensure that basic requirements are fulfilled for the platform, applications and product manufacturing chain – this is needed to make a secure product.</p><p>As an example, Trussed ensures keys are kept secret by storing them encrypted-at-rest at all times. It can do so either by using a backing storage that is encrypted by hardware, or adding a software encryption layer itself – one or the other, but it needs to be ensured.</p><p>As another example, Trussed needs a source of entropy. Ideally, a platform has a hardware source, alternatively, the manufacturing process can inject an entropic seed – again, one or the other (or both) need to be ensured.</p><p>To sum up, we hope that you find use for Trussed in your products. The more eyes, the better! If you do use Trussed, we’d like you to advertise that you do. In this case, please contact <a href="mailto:alliance@trussed.dev">alliance@trussed.dev</a> so we can discuss. There is no formal certification process at this point.</p><h3 id="some-more-details-about-portability">Some more details about portability</h3><p>Cryptographic implementations …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Svelte lures developers with the promise of better performance and smaller bundle size than competitors like React. But, since it is new, its eco-system is small. Let's change that!
    </p>
<p>There are many differences between Svelte and React. Svelte is a compiler, while React lives in the browser. Svelte components are written into '.svelte' files, while React uses <code><code>jsx</code></code>/<code><code>tsx</code></code>. React has the virtual DOM while, Svelte doesn't. So, are these frameworks so different, that we have to write every library from scratch?
    </p>
<p>No.
    </p>
<p>I took a React library, which I like, and translated it to Svelte. It is a good excercise to see what the real differences between React and Svelte are, and to see which concepts are related. The library I chose is <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a>. It has unimpressive 295 stars as a standalone library at github, but it belongs to the <code><code>react-virtualized</code></code> library, which is currently at 21 thousand stars. For comparison, the highest rated Svelte specific library besides Svelte and Sapper is <code><code>svelte-material-ui</code></code> with 1.5k stars. The <code><code>auto-sizer</code></code> allows your component to grow or shrink to the available space on your page.
    </p>
<img alt="An image of a port, with a ship and a crane." title="Port" src="https://gradientdescent.de/images/port.jpg">
<h2 id="PortingAuto-Sizer">Porting Auto-Sizer
    </h2>

<blockquote>
      
    </blockquote>
<p>The library <code><code>react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code> has only one exported component, so it is quite a low-hanging fruit to port. It is older, so it is implemented as a React class component. React component have more lifecycle methods than in Svelte, so it may be hard or impossible to reproduce the same behavior. In this case it will be no problem.
    </p>

<h3 id="AutoSizercomponent">AutoSizer component
    </h3>

<p>There are only two files of interest in the library. The first file is <code><code>src/vendor/detectElementResize.js</code></code> and it contains only code, that is independent of React. So, I could simply copy it into my project. The other file is <code><code>src/index.js</code></code>. The author used <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a> for static type checking, so it starts with a lot of type definitions. Other than that, the file just holds the component source code.
    </p>
<p>In the root of my new project <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer"><code><code>svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code></a> I create a file <code><code>AutoSizer.svelte</code></code>.
    </p>
<h4 id="Props">Props
    </h4>

<p>First, in the scripts part I've put all props of the React component, except children and style. Both of these are handled a bit differently in Svelte. Some of the props have a default, so I copied that over:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>AutoSizer</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> React</span><span>.</span><span>PureComponent</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Props</span><span>,</span><span> State</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>static</span><span> defaultProps </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>onResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableHeight</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>disableWidth</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>style</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{},</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This becomes the following:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let onResize = () =&gt; </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableHeight = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let disableWidth = false;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let className = "";</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultHeight = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let defaultWidth = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    export let nonce = undefined;</span></span>
<span><span>    ...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="State">State
    </h4>

<p>The React component defines a state variable and a few class member:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>state</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>height</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>width</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>  _parentNode</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>HTMLElement</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>DetectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>which both become simple state variables in Svelte:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultHeight</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>width</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>defaultWidth</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>_parentNode</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_detectElementResize</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>

<h4 id="componentDidMountandcomponentWillUnmount">componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
    </h4>

<p>The code from the <code><code>componentDidMount</code></code> and <code><code>componentWillUnmount</code></code> member functions is put into Sveltes <code><code>onMount</code></code> and <code><code>onDestroy</code></code> callbacks respecitvely.
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// react-virtualized-auto-sizer/src/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>componentDidMount</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>nonce</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>      </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>The variable unloading (<code><code>const {nonce}...</code></code>) is deleted and also all <code><code>this</code></code>-s are also removed (thank you vs-code find-and-replace function :) ):
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>onMount</span><span>(</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>            </span><span>_autoSizer</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<h4 id="_onResize">_onResize

<p>The "<code><code>_onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>" member becomes a const function "<code><code>const _onResize = () =&gt; {...</code></code>". Again, props unloading is deleted. The React component uses <code><code>width</code></code> and <code><code>height</code></code> again, so I had to rename the new consts to <code><code>width_</code></code> and <code><code>height_</code></code>. And the <code><code>setState</code></code> part is changed:

    </pre>
<h4 id="render">render
    </h4>

<p>So far, there have been no significant changes. Syntax is a little bit different, but not much. For the <code><code>render</code></code> function we got a little more to do. Let's break this down to four steps.
    </p>
<p>Step 1 - Styling: The React code defines a <code><code>outerStyle</code></code> object
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>render</span><span>() </span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>   </span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>outerStyle</span><span>:</span><span> Object </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>overflow</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>visible</span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>    </span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and in the code the height and the width of this style object can be set to 0. In Svelte, inline styling is not supplied as an object, but as a string. An equivalent implementation is straight forward, but I take a different route here, since Svelte makes it easier to avoid inline styling. I create two boolean variables <code><code>let outerstylewidth = false, outerstyleheight = false</code></code>, which are set to true, when the <code><code>width</code></code> or <code><code>height</code></code> style would have been set to 0 by the React component. Then I add the following style element to the <code><code>.svelte</code></code> file and make the two classes conditional with the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/classes"><code><code>class:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>...</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;style&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    div {</span></span>
<span><span>        overflow: visible;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstylewidth {</span></span>
<span><span>        width:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    .outerstyleheight{</span></span>
<span><span>        height:0;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/style&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;div class={className} class:outerstylewidth class:outerstyleheight bind:this={_autoSizer}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>...</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Step 2 - ref -&gt; bind: I use the The <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this"><code><code>bind:this</code></code> directive</a> as an exchange for the <code><code>ref</code></code>-logic. Note that this makes the <code><code>_setRef</code></code> member function unecessary.
    </p>

<p>Step 3 - make render code reactive: The logic part of the <code><code>render</code></code> function is marked as reactive, since it is called each time something changes:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.js</span></span>

<p>Typescript declarations make the life of the consumer of the library easier. The types of the React library are stored within the definitelyTyped project <code><code>@types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer</code></code>.
    </p>
<p>The React component is changed into a Svelte component:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>/// @types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer/index.d.ts</span></span>

    </pre>
<h4 id="Howtouseit">How to use it
    </h4>

<p>That's it, the library is ported. You can load the library with
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm install --save-dev svelte-virtualized-auto-sizer</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>This is how you would use the original in React:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    {(height,width)=&gt;(</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={{!width!}}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>      Test</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;/div&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    )}</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/AutoSizer&gt;</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>and here is the equivalent in Svelte, using the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/slot-props"><code><code>let:</code></code> directive</a>:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>&lt;AutoSizer let:width={childWidth} let:height={childHeight}&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    &lt;div style={"width:"+childWidth+"px;height:"…</span></span></code></p></pre></div></div>

    </span></p><p>One of my favourite programming languages in the last few years has been <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a>. While the language has not yet reached its 1.0 version, it has been widely used in production and has a growing ecosystem. Crystal provides an easy setup and allows you to jump straight into developing your own Crystal programs. I’m going to walk you through getting it setup and how you can get started!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">puts "Hello World"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>Crystal is a general purpose, Ruby-inspired compiled programming language, making it extremely fast and easy to program with. The syntax is strongly inspired by Ruby, but also provides static typechecking. Crystal sits somewhere in the top 100 programming languages according to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a>, not widely used but don’t let that put you off!</p><p>I was originally interested in Crystal due to its expressive syntax and the claims on its speed. I am likely in the minority in that I came into Crystal with no prior Ruby experience. Crystal soon became my go-to language for personal programming projects. My project <a href="https://github.com/azula-lang/azula">Azula</a> (WIP programming language) was built entirely in Crystal - a choice a made due to Crystal’s nice macro system and built-in LLVM bindings. Crystal was an excellent choice, allowing rapid development and producing a small binary (1.9mb in Crystal vs 3mb in Go).</p><h3>Shards</h3><p>The Crystal ecosystem is powered by its Shard system. Shards is Crystal’s dependency manager that is usually installed along with Crystal. It aims to allow reproducible installs across platforms by declaring dependencies and their versions. You can read more about Shards <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/reference/the_shards_command/index.html">here</a>.</p><h2>Installing Crystal</h2><p>On Ubuntu, installing Crystal is as easy as running:</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ curl -fsSL https://crystal-lang.org/install.sh | sudo bash</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>For other platforms, have a look at the <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/install/">Crystal install guide</a>!</p><h2>First Crystal Program</h2><p>Crystal provides a nice scaffolding tool to setup a new project, including a README template, license and gitignore.</p><deckgo-highlight-code bash="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">$ crystal init app myproject</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>If we open up <code>myproject/src/myproject.cr</code>, we can start writing our Crystal program!</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">
          <code slot="code">def say(message : String)
    puts message
end

say "Hello!"</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>In this example, we create a function called <code>say</code> that accepts a string and passes it to <code>puts</code>. As you can see, almost identical to Ruby except for the typing of the parameter in the function.</p><h2>Project Structure</h2><h3>src</h3><p>Inside the <code>src/</code> directory is where all the Crystal files will go. It can contain subdirectories, allowing you to divide up your code. You can include separate files by using the <code>require</code> keyword.</p><h3>spec</h3><p>The <code>spec/</code> directory is the home for your tests. Using the <code>crystal spec</code> subcommand, we can run all our tests.</p><deckgo-highlight-code crystal="" terminal="carbon" highlight-lines="">

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>
series, I give an accelerated introduction to game development in Unity.
<a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">Subscribers</a> have been following this series over the
past few months, often suggesting areas to cover or elaborate on. A few months
ago, a reader<!-- -->—<!-- -->also a software engineer<!-- -->—<!-- -->reached out to me (lightly
edited, emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>The biggest unknown for me is: How do I start?</strong> What does the process of
creating a game look like? Should I build the scenes first? Should I design
the gameplay mechanics first? With business software, it’s much more familiar.
It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>While there is no single correct answer, we can still make some distinctions
that can help get us oriented. The answer will also undoubtedly depend on <em>who</em>
is doing the development: an individual, small indie team, or larger studio? If
an individual, the answer will also depend on their primary skillset: a
developer, artist, or designer?</p><p>Here, I’ll give heuristics especially helpful for individual Software Engineers
building a game on their own as a side project, hobby, or proof-of-concept.</p><figure><p><span>

Do you have a sense of what game mechanics
your game will have? Do you know what genre, controls, and themes this game will
have?</p><p>If <em>yes</em>, you’re ready to decide <strong><a href="#start-coding">where to start coding</a></strong>.
Otherwise, you have a few more questions to ask yourself.</p><h3>Do you <em>want</em> to know what you’re building?</h3><p>It’s totally fine not to have a project in mind! Maybe you’re prototyping.
Perhaps you’re throwing a bunch of mini-games on the wall and seeing what
sticks. Or you’re looking for inspiration and trying to implement random
mechanics to see what feels fun.</p><p><strong>If you’re hoping to begin working on a specific, cohesive game</strong>, you will
likely want to know what you’re building. Consider brainstorming and sketching
out an informal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_design_document">game design document</a>.
There are
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=game+design+document+template">plenty of templates</a>
of various levels of detail you could decide to use. Especially as a software
engineer toying with abstract ideas in my brain, I’ll start with a super
high-level GDD, covering the feel, themes, genre, and mechanics of the game I
have in mind. Maybe a few pictures or sketches for inspiration, and that’s it.
The key part of this exercise will be the list of mechanics I’m working on.</p><p><strong>If you want to prototype and experiment</strong>, you should already have a vague
sense of 1-2 mechanics that could be fun: Maybe unusual movement or a different
control scheme. It could be a traditional mechanic that you’re wondering how to
implement. For instance, I might decide to build a 3rd Person character and
camera controller to see the “feel” of it, experiment with it a tiny bit, and do
something smooth and polish that I feel good about. I might end up keeping that
code in my back pocket for later, or I might use play-through sessions with that
controller to move around a scene, add a few assets, and use that as a starting
place to see the “feel” various mechanics and designs.</p><h2 id="start-coding">I know the mechanics I care about. Now what?</h2><figure><p><span>

development. You do that by failing fast and getting feedback early. In game
development, the primary metric for success is a feeling: the game should be
fun. So, when deciding what to start with when working on a game, one good
question to ask is: <em>“How can I see if this game is fun as soon as possible?”</em>
or <em>“How can I implement the ‘fun’ part of the game ASAP?”</em></p><p>One way to do that is to look at a game’s mechanics and implement them in some
order. The advice that resonates with me is implementing game mechanics in order
of what the most <em>“core”</em> mechanic first.</p><figure><p><span>

plane shooting game—as an example. Here’s my attempt at writing its main
mechanics in descending order of importance:</p><ol><li>Movement: Navigate a vertically scrolling world</li><li>Obstacles &amp; Dodging: Player can collide with stationary obstacles and debris</li><li>Shooting: Player can shoot straight ahead to defeat obstacles</li><li>Enemies: Enemies are moving obstacles that can shoot back</li><li>Player Health: A player can take a finite number of hits before losing the
game</li><li>Enemy Health: Some enemies take multiple shots to destroy</li><li>Boosts: The player can pick up boosts that improve health, shooting, etc.</li></ol><p>… and so on.</p><p>If I’m trying to develop <em>1945</em> from scratch, I will implement that list in that
order. The game’s mechanics build on each other, so I can only tell if shooting
is “fun” is if I can move around the screen and if there are obstacles I’m
trying to clear (otherwise, there’s no urgency to just pressing <em>Space</em> and
seeing projectiles coming out of a plane).</p><p>In simpler games, we might order our mechanics so that every new feature adds to
a game’s feel. So, with every new mechanic you add, you can play the game and
tell if it’s adding what you hope for it to add.</p><p>In more complex games, some of the “core” mechanics might be too ‘standard’ to
be “risky” <em>per se</em>, but you’ll still need the core mechanics implemented to
assess how fun the other mechanics are. You might choose to use a simpler
throwaway implementation, like a few lines of input-handling code and Unity’s
<code>CharacterController</code> component. You’ll want your core mechanics just smooth
enough that they don’t ruin the fun of the things you’ll layer on top of it.
Another approach here is to use the asset store. I’ve previously mentioned the
<a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/ufps-ultimate-fps-106748?aid=1011leWs6">Ultimate FPS (UFPS)</a>
asset, which you might choose to use when building an FPS game, and move on to
implementing the combat or some more unique (but still “core” feature of the
gameplay first).</p><h2>So I picked a mechanic, but where do I start programming <em>within</em> this mechanic?</h2><p><em>Within</em> a mechanic, your traditional software engineering intuition becomes
helpful. I hope to spend subsequent articles discussing patterns that are
especially helpful in Unity, but here are a few to consider:</p><ul><li>Work within Unity’s Object-Component paradigm. If you’re adding a new
<em>capability</em> to your player, write it as its own component.</li><li><em>Tuning</em> is especially important in game development; representing a
mechanic’s interesting pieces as <em>configurable</em>, <em>serializable</em> data that
can be input to a component will help you playtest and iterate.</li><li>Don’t shy away from using plain-old data objects to represent core concepts
you’re working with. E.g., health, ammo information, or powerups. Make it
serializable if you want it passed around in the editor (or saved to disk
across sessions).</li><li>Where pieces of a concept don’t correspond to a single object in a scene,
consider using Scriptable Objects to do the jobs. Scriptable Objects
introduce many patterns that might help represent what you’re doing.</li></ul><p>A few articles I have already written might prove helpful:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt1-basic-concepts/">Basic Concepts in Unity for Software Engineers</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt2-six-practices/">6 Software Practices to Keep, Shed, and Adopt in Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/09/patterns-in-unity-adventure-tutorial/">Making Sense of Patterns in Unity’s Adventure Game Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/2020/10/unity-for-engineers-pt5-object-component/">Understanding Unity Engine Objects</a></li></ul><p>You might also take a look at patterns covered in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://unity.com/how-to/architect-game-code-scriptable-objects">Three ways to architect your game with ScriptableObjects</a>,

data and abstractions, the reader’s initial comment also becomes the answer:</p><blockquote><p>It’s easy to think, “Well, okay, I need to write the DAO or controller, etc.”
But with games, I’m lost.</p></blockquote><p>Beyond learning about useful patterns and abstractions in game development to
make development clearer and cleaner, the real takeaway is to decide <em>what</em> to
work on at a macro-level.</p><h2>How much time should I spend on one mechanic?</h2><p>As you’re developing a mechanic, what’s a good signal you should move on to the
next on your list? Generally, that would be when you’re convinced:</p><ul><li>This mechanic <em>feels fun</em> and <em>adds to the game</em>,</li><li>Your implementation adds <em>just the
<a href="https://www.e4developer.com/2018/11/21/having-just-the-right-amount-of-technical-debt/">right amount</a></em>
of technical debt.</li></ul><p>Traditionally, folks will often say to worry about polish at the later stages of
your development. In his GDC 2016 micro-talk <em>“Pizzazz First, Polish Later”</em>,
Lee Perry makes a distinction in this traditional wisdom.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8QAVGeEj-U?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Certain levels of pizzazz might give you a better sense of your mechanic and how
fun it feels. A certain amount of polish or pizzazz can also help you see your
game in a new light and motivate you to keep going.
<a href="https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design/">Juice</a>
is another form of pizzazz; in certain dull moments of your game design, adding
juice might be a low-cost way to get back into the groove of things.</p><p>I hope the conflicting advice shows there isn’t a silver bullet on what to add
when. Rather—as in traditional software development—this choice is about a
series of trade-offs that depend on the developer, the project, and lots more.</p><h2>Are you developing a game or architecting systems?</h2><p>For some software engineers, we’re often drawn to writing code for systems that
seem <em>interesting</em>. Sometimes, I have a game in mind, but <em>really</em>, I’m
interested in implementing a cool inventory system where <em>everything</em> in the
game is an item. It might not be the core mechanic, but it might be the thing I
want to build.</p><p>It’s important to recognize when you’re not building a game but building a
system. If you just quit your job to be a full-time indie gamedev and have a
year of runway before your run out of cash, it is probably a bad idea to start
building a complex inventory system that you don’t even know you’ll need<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
But if you’re programming on the side to flex your game development muscle, then
go right at it.</p><hr><p>I don’t think I’m qualified <em>per se</em> to answer the …</p></div></div>

They usually result from: </p><ol><li>Generating HTML unsafely (parameterizing without encoding correctly).</li><li>Allowing users to edit HTML directly (WYSIWYG editors, for example).</li><li>Allowing users to upload HTML/SVG files and serving those back unsafely.</li><li>Using JavaScript unsafely (passing untrusted data into executable functions/properties).</li><li>Using outdated and vulnerable JavaScript frameworks.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-"><a href="#how-to-prevent-xss-vulnerabilities-">How to prevent XSS vulnerabilities?</a></h2><p>Follow these steps: </p><ol><li>Generate HTML safely using a templating engine, or use a static JavaScript frontend to avoid HTML generation altogether.</li><li>If you display untrusted HTML content on your website, purify it first and contain it in a sandboxed frame.</li><li>Serve all downloads with a proper Content-Disposition header to prevent user-supplied HTML/SVG from being rendered in your origin.</li><li>Don't pass untrusted data into executable JavaScript functions/properties such as <code>eval</code>, <code>innerHTML</code> or <code>href</code>.</li><li>Use well-known components with a good security history and keep them up to date.</li><li>Implement a proper CSP (Content Security Policy).</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-untrusted-data-"><a href="#what-is-untrusted-data-">What is untrusted data?</a></h2><p>Before we begin, let's quickly touch on this point. For the sake of this article, anything that is not controlled by your web application is untrusted data.</p><p>User input is one clear example. But you should also consider any data retrieved from external sources, even your database or API, as potentially dangerous and render it with proper safety measures.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is that if it's not a static resource, then it's untrusted data, at least on some level.</p><h2 id="why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-"><a href="#why-are-xss-vulnerabilities-nasty-">Why are XSS vulnerabilities nasty?</a></h2><p>There is sometimes a misconception that XSS vulnerabilities are low severity bugs. They are not. The power to execute JavaScript code on a website in other people's browsers is equivalent to logging in to the hosting server and changing the HTML files for the affected users.</p><p>As such, XSS attacks effectively make the attacker logged in as the target user, with the nasty addition of tricking the user into giving some information (such as their password) to the attacker, perhaps downloading and executing malware on the user's workstation.</p><p>And it's not like XSS vulnerabilities only affect individual users. Stored XSS affects everyone who visits the infected page, and reflected XSS can often <a href="">spread like wildfire</a>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samy_(computer_worm)</a>.</p><h2 id="1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely"><a href="#1--avoid-xss-by-generating-html-safely">1. Avoid XSS by generating HTML safely</a></h2><h3 id="a-simple-example"><a href="#a-simple-example">A simple example</a></h3><p>Here is a PHP script that is vulnerable to XSS: </p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>It is vulnerable because it generates HTML unsafely. The <code>search</code> parameter is not <em>encoded</em> correctly. An attacker can create a link such as the following, which would execute the attacker's JavaScript code on the website when the target opens it: </p><pre><code>https://www.example.com/?search=<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>Results in HTML like: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>alert</span><span>(</span><span>"XSS"</span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="the-importance-of-encoding"><a href="#the-importance-of-encoding">The importance of encoding</a></h3><p>So how then can you safely display the value <code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML? The answer is: HTML entity encoding: </p><pre><code> <span>&amp;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>amp<span>;</span>
 <span>&lt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>lt<span>;</span>
 <span>&gt;</span> <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>gt<span>;</span>
 " <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>quot<span>;</span>
 ' <span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>&amp;</span>#x27<span>;</span></code></pre><p>PHP has a function called <code>htmlspecialchars</code> that performs this operation. So if we change our script a little bit (This is a horrible legacy approach, but it suffices now for demonstration), the resulting HTML will be safe.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>Creates: </p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for: <span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span>alert(<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>XSS<span title="&quot;">&amp;quot;</span>)<span title="<">&amp;lt;</span>/script<span title=">">&amp;gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h3 id="encoding-contexts"><a href="#encoding-contexts">Encoding contexts</a></h3><p>HTML entity encoding is suitable only when you want to put something inside HTML tags or quoted HTML attributes. If your variables go inside JavaScript variables or URL addresses, you need another encoding function to avoid XSS.</p><p>So make sure you are using the proper encoding for the context.</p><h3 id="quotes-"><a href="#quotes-">Quotes!</a></h3><p>Don't forget to quote your HTML attributes and JavaScript variables or no encoding in the world will save you. The following PHP script <em>is</em> vulnerable to XSS because you can enter a value such as: <code>foo onClick=alert(1)</code>.</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'&lt;input type="text" value='</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>'&gt;&lt;/input&gt;'</span><span>;</span></code></pre><h3 id="don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields"><a href="#don-t-put-untrusted-data-in-executable-fields">Don't put untrusted data in executable fields</a></h3><p>Also, never put untrusted data, encoded or not, within HTML attributes that execute something. These include <code>onClick</code>, <code>onMouseEnter</code> and friends, but also <code>src</code> and <code>href</code> because someone can put <code>javascript:alert("XSS")</code> for the value, and once again, you have an XSS vulnerability.</p><h3 id="scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-"><a href="#scary--isn-t-it--but-don-t-worry-">Scary, isn't it? But don't worry.</a></h3><p>There are quite a few things that can go wrong, and OWASP has curated a nice list of them here: <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank">Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet</a></p><p>However, I wouldn't advise you to focus on that too much. After all, are we thrilled with code like this?</p><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>"&lt;p&gt;Search results for: "</span> <span>.</span> <span>htmlspecialchars</span><span>(</span><span>$_GET</span><span>(</span><span>'search'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>.</span> <span>"&lt;/p&gt;"</span></code></pre><p>No. That isn't very good. Mixing presentation and code is so 90's.</p><pre><code>$ <span>rm</span> legacy.php</code></pre><h3 id="template-engines-to-the-rescue"><a href="#template-engines-to-the-rescue">Template engines to the rescue</a></h3><p>Instead, you should have your controller method somewhere render a template with the data you want to display. In the case of PHP, Twig is a good option. You would have <code>search.html.twig</code> with the following content: </p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Search results for:</span> <span><span><span>{{</span></span><span>search</span><span><span>}}</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>And Twig would automatically encode your <code>search</code> parameter due to the template engine's automatic escaping.</p><ul><li><a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping" target="_blank">https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html#output-escaping</a></li></ul><p>There are good template engines for all programming languages worth their salt. There's Jinja for Python, Thymeleaf for Java, and so on.</p><p>Just note that not all template engines are created equal. Some of them have an excellent and standard way to add HTML attributes, Thymeleaf's <code>th:attr</code> being one of them.</p><p>Then there are others where you have to be careful to quote your attributes.</p><p>And probably none of them will protect you from putting untrusted data into <code>href</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>onclick</code>, etc., so you still have to keep those in mind.</p><h3 id="---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-"><a href="#---or-just-don-t-generate-html-at-all-">...or just don't generate HTML at all!</a></h3><p>Another great way not to deal with XSS when generating HTML is not to generate HTML. You can do this by creating a static HTML/JavaScript frontend and perhaps a backend API. Try <a href="https://www.appsecmonkey.com/blog/xss-attack-and-prevention/NextJS" target="_blank">https://nextjs.org/</a>, perhaps. It's pretty cool!</p><h2 id="2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content"><a href="#2--avoid-xss-by-purifying-and-sandboxing-untrusted-content">2. Avoid XSS by purifying and sandboxing untrusted content</a></h2><p>There are scenarios where you might want to render content that you don't fully trust. Maybe you want your users to create HTML in a WYSIWYG editor, or perhaps you want to download an HTML response from a third party and display it to the user.</p><p>Whatever the use case, the solution is the same. Purify and sandbox.</p><h3 id="purify"><a href="#purify">Purify</a></h3><p>Purifying is the act of removing any dangerous parts from an HTML string. You can do this on the client-side with <code>DOMPurify</code> or on the server-side with several tools such as the OWASP <code>Java HTML sanitizer</code> for Java or Mozzila's <code>bleach</code> for Python. Just pick a well-esteemed one.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify" target="_blank">https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify</a></li><li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/" target="_blank">https://owasp.org/www-project-java-html-sanitizer/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bleach" target="_blank">https://github.com/mozilla/bleach</a></li></ul><h3 id="sandbox"><a href="#sandbox">Sandbox</a></h3><p>Purifying is an excellent first step, but I wouldn't leave my website's security hanging on that alone. Luckily, there is a great control that we can use to display untrusted HTML content. May I present: sandboxed iframes!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_iframe_sandbox.asp</a></li></ul><p>Sandboxed iframes run by default in their own <em>origin</em>. That is, if anything goes south in the frame, the frame cannot access your website. Also, sandboxed iframes by default prevent script execution and even links. Very useful for our purposes!</p><p>Here is an example of a non-sandboxed frame. If you run it, you should see an <code>alert</code> box with the message <em>evilness</em>.</p><p>Here is another fiddle with the <code>sandbox</code> attribute specified. Notice that this time the script does not get executed.</p><p>Such is the magic of sandboxed frames.</p><h2 id="3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly"><a href="#3--avoid-xss-by-serving-downloads-properly">3. Avoid XSS by serving downloads properly</a></h2><p>When you allow users to upload files, there is a risk that they upload a malicious HTML, SVG, or similar file to your server. And suppose the file is then downloadable from your domain, and your web server serves it like any other HTML file. An attacker could upload a file with malicious JavaScript content and redirect unwitting users to the page.</p><p>To prevent this, serve all content that is not supposed to be rendered directly in a web browser with a proper <code>Content-Disposition</code> header. Like so: </p><pre><code><span>Content-Disposition</span><span>:</span> attachment; filename="filename.jpg"</code></pre><p>By specifying <code>attachment</code>, you tell browsers to show the save file dialog.</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition</a></li></ul><h2 id="4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely"><a href="#4--avoid-xss-by-using-javascript-safely">4. Avoid XSS by using JavaScript safely</a></h2><p>Not all XSS vulnerabilities arise from unsafe HTML. Sometimes your JavaScript code can have XSS vulnerabilities in it.</p><p>To get one, all you have to do is pass untrusted data into a function or property that either executes something or changes the HTML, HREF, or SRC of something.</p><p>Here are a couple of examples just so that you get the idea.</p><ol><li>Passing untrusted data to jQuery <code>append</code> (which writes HTML).</li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Passing untrusted data to a <code>href</code> attribute. This example demonstrates that not even React applications are safe from XSS if you don't know what you are doing (click the user's homepage link to see).</li></ol><ol start="3"><li>Passing untrusted data to <code>eval</code> This is an example of passing untrusted data to a function that executes something. This simple calculator will execute code if you enter values like <code>;alert('xss');</code> into one of the operands.</li></ol><p>There is virtually an infinite list of functions and properties into which you shouldn't pass untrusted data. They include things like <code>innerHTML</code>, <code>outerHTML</code>, <code>setTimeout</code> and so on. And of course, the JavaScript libraries you use will have their own, just like the jQuery example above.</p><p>It's better to be safe than sorry, so check the documentation for the function/property before assigning/appending untrusted data into it.</p><h2 id="5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date"><a href="#5--avoid-xss-by-using-well-known-javascript-libraries-and-keeping-them-up-to-date">5.

    <p>If you’re creating technical content in order to teach others, you might be tempted to use words like “easy”, “simple”, or “straightforward” because you want to put the learner at ease. Unfortunately, those words can have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>How “easy” something is depends on the learner’s frame of reference. It’s relative to their existing experiences. When a learner encounters something that they hear is easy, or simple, or straightforward, and they encounter a problem, they tend to internalize it; “This is easy… why am I struggling? I’m not cut out for this!” This cancels out all the good intentions you had.</p>
<p>When I’m editing a document, article, book, or script, I have a list of words and phrases that I try to eliminate right away. I call them “bad words”. Here are some of the words that tend to be demotivational.</p>
<ul>
<li>basically</li>
<li>easy</li>
<li>just</li>
<li>obvious</li>
<li>obviously</li>
<li>straightforward</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>simply</li>
</ul>
<p>I flag these and remove them, as in most cases they’re not necessary. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remove “Simply” and the sentence loses no meaning and becomes tighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reboot the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I’ll ask the author to add the context that might be missing. A lot of times, authors are making assumptions about the experience the readers have. Consider this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Okta is a simple way to add authentication to your app. Just add it to your project. Much easier than writing your own authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the documentation for Okta, it’s anything but simple. And you don’t “just” add it to your project. You need an account. You need to create users. You need to import the appropriate libraries, and integrate the code into your codebase.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this a hundred times, you may indeed find this easy. As an author, you have to remember that you’re writing something like this to teach others. You want them to be successful. So you may have to share the details so the learner has the right frame of reference, and can make the call if it’s “easy” for themselves. Consider this version instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okta lets you add authentication to your app instead of writing your own logic, which will be more complicated and more prone to security vulnerabilities. In this tutorial you’ll sign up for an Okta account, obtain the API keys you need, create your users, and integrate Okta’s JavaScript code with your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version tells the reader what’s in store, including an explanation as to why Okta is a good choice over writing your own implementation.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s much more text. But readers can skip it. Assume your readers are as smart as you. Give them all the pieces and let them decide what’s easy, and what they can skip.</p>
<p>I suggest adding words like “easy”, “simple”, and others to your text editor’s spelling dictionary as misspelled words so they show up as you’re writing or editing.</p>
<p>You can also install plugins for your editor that focus on improving writing. The <a href="https://github.com/TravisTheTechie/vscode-write-good">write-good</a> plugin for Visual Studio Code is handy, and you can find similar plugins for <a href="https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/writegood.vim">Vim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode">Emacs</a>. These will find some of the words I listed, among other phrases and words that cause your writing to be weaker than it could be. Be warned though; these plugins have opinions of their own, and may ignore some words while flagging others. Tweak them to find what works best for your learners. After all, you’re writing for them, not just for yourself.</p>

             <h2>-1. Overview</h2>
<p> After the prototyping phase of any electronics project, I like to make a "Motherboard" PCB. For this phase I will continue to use breakout boards for all of the individual components, but link them together using a PCB. This allows the PCB design to stay simple and flexible, and makes them easy to hand manufacture them in my workshop. This is a great setup if you want to do a small (10ish) beta run of your project before designing a full product. I have shipped many hardware products using this stage, it's a great way to validate your MVP before putting money into tooling and CM bring up. </p> <p> This tutorial will walk through the process that I follow to create a motherboard. The intended audience is someone who has already wired up a prototype on a breadboard, and wants to get started bundling them together into a motherboard. This will be the guide I wish existed when I got started doing this. </p>

<p> This is just the process I figured out for myself, it's by no means perfect. If you have any feedback or questions about any of this stuff, want a PCB design for your project, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me: mdl0394@gmail.com </p>
<p> This is Part 1 of the guide. In this guide we will go through initial setup, component model sourcing and schematic design. In Part 2 we will go through board layout and ordering PCBs. If you want to be notified when Part 2 comes out, sign up for email notifications, or subscribe to the RSS feed. </p>

        <h2 id="0-before-you-build-a-pcb">0. Before you build a PCB</h2>

<p>Before you build a PCB you should already have all of the breakout boards &amp; devkits you want to use for the project. When designing the motherboard you should already have a good understanding of how the electronics components are wired together, if you donâ€™t itâ€™s easy to make costly mistakes.</p>

<p>For this project I will be using my Caffstat (Hackable Smart Home Thermostat) project. If you are interested in a smart home thermostat feel free to check out that <a href="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/caffstat_beta">project here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7eacc185287abd48aa4bca8d5f02bff250b987d9/def8e/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/untitled.png" alt="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7eacc185287abd48aa4bca8d5f02bff250b987d9/def8e/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/untitled.png">

<p>These 3 images represent the stages of any electronics project: Breadboard -&gt; Project Board -&gt; PCB</p>

<p>This project contains 3 different breakout boards and a few through hole components. The brains of the operation are an ESP32 Devkit, there are breakouts for the Thermostat and Screen, and through hold components for the buttons, resistors, and relays.</p>

<h3 id="01-installing-eagle">0.1 Installing Eagle</h3>

<p>For this tutorial I will we be using Eagle. Itâ€™s got a free tier tool that, and it integrates well into the Autodesk suite. Eagle is free for up to two layer boards, which should be all you need for most electronics projects. The information here will be pretty generally applicable to any tool, although the screenshots will be of eagle specifically.</p>

<p>You can download eagle for free <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview">here</a></p>

<h2 id="1-anatomy-of-a-pcb-design">1. Anatomy of a PCB Design</h2>

<p>A PCB Design contains two main parts, the schematic and the layout. The schematic is an abstract diagram of the connections between components in your project, and the layout is the actual physical layout of those components, and the electrical traces that connect them. The great thing about PCB design software, is that the schematic will be enforced when you are creating the layout, this makes it very straight forward to create the layout after youâ€™ve created the schematic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%203.png"></p>

<p>This is the completed schematic for the caffstat project. You can see all of the breakout boards as individual components (red). The connections between them are mostly being managed by net labels to simplify the schematic (more on this later).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%204.png"></p>

<p>Here is an image of the completed layout. Every component has found a space on the board, and all of the electrical traces have been drawn. Donâ€™t worry if it looks complicated/messy now, when we go step by step it will be very easy to create.</p>

<h2 id="2-finding-or-creating-component-models">2. Finding or Creating Component Models</h2>

<p>Before you can begin drawing a schematic and layout, you need to find or create models for each and every one of your components. A device model contains both a <strong>symbol</strong> for part (goes in the schematic) and a <strong>footprint</strong> of the part (for the layout). I will list out some great resources for finding or creating these here. I can create a full tutorial for creating your own component models if you are interested, let me know at mdl0394@gmail.com</p>

<p>One thing to note is that Eagle comes pre-packaged with a bunch of common components. These are mostly things like standard resistors/capacitors. Itâ€™s worth checking the pre-installed library before spending too much time scouring the internet. The easiest way to check the library is to use the â€œAdd Partâ€� button discussed in section 3.2 of this tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="21-octopart">2.1. Octopart</h3>

<p>The best tool I have found for looking up components and downloading models is <a href="https://octopart.com/">Octopart</a>. Their mission is to provide the best search engine for electronics components. Almost every part can be found in the search engine, I always check here first.</p>

<p>If octopart has the CAD Model for your part, it will appear like this, you want to download the Eagle format, this will download the library that you can install later.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%205.png"></p>

<h3 id="22-desparate-googling">2.2. Desparate Googling</h3>

<p>I have also found quite a few schematics by just googling the part. It can often be helpful to try different variations on the name, and include the term â€œEagleâ€� or â€œ.lbrâ€� (Eagle library file extension) in your query. If you do find a schematic, make sure you do some measurements (you can do this on the layout of your design) to ensure it matches well with your part (sometimes people upload bad designs, or are modeling something slightly different than yours, you donâ€™t want to order a PCB with bad footprints)</p>

<h3 id="23-installing-a-library">2.3. Installing a library</h3>

<p>Once you have a library itâ€™s easy to install, drag the Library (.lbr) file into the <code>libraries</code> section of the Eagle Control Panel. <strong>Important:</strong> after dragging the lbr file, make sure you right click and hit â€œUseâ€� otherwise you wonâ€™t actually be able to add it to your project. Libraries in use will have a green dot next to them</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%206.png"></p>

<h3 id="24-creating-your-own-library">2.4. Creating your own Library</h3>

<p>If you fail to find any schematics online (often the case with cheap breakout boards, or with chinese knockoffs) you might have to make your own. Itâ€™s not too hard to make your own models, mostly just a little bit tedious. Creating your own models &amp; libraries is a full tutorial in itself, if I get interest I can put that together, for now I will refer you to the resources I used to learn the process.</p>

<p>A good tutorial on how to make custom eagle components can be found here: <a href="https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/">https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/eagle-components/</a></p>

<h2 id="3-creating-your-schematic">3. Creating your Schematic</h2>

<p>Once you have your components, you can start creating your schematic.</p>

<h3 id="31-basic-project-setup">3.1. Basic Project Setup</h3>

<p>First thing is to make a new Project and new Schematic in eagle. Go into the projects section, right click and hit â€œNew Projectâ€�. Then right click and hit â€œNew Schematicâ€�. Once the schematic opens, you also want to create a layout (Weâ€™ll use this in Step 4). Do this by hitting the â€œGenerate/Switch to Boardâ€� button on the top bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png" alt="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6647e677a7889893fc65d08499400076efd2adee/d3801/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/screen_shot_2021-01-18_at_9.26.13_am.png"></p>

<h3 id="32-place-your-components">3.2. Place your components</h3>

<p>Once you have a schematic you need to put all of your part symbols on. The add part button is on the left bar, clicking this will bring up a dialogue that lets you choose a component. If you donâ€™t see a component you installed here, go back to the control panel and make sure you selected â€œUseâ€� on the right click menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%207.png"></p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%208.png"></p>

<p>Add all of your components to your schematic. Make sure you give yourself a bunch of room around components to create connections. You should also try to sort the parts in logical groupings, the simpler your schematic, the less likely-hood of bugs.</p>

<p>While placing components there are a few useful tools at your disposal. The Move, Rotate and Copy tools at the top of the left panel are all useful for organizing your schematic. When you want to select an object, the easiest thing to do is to click the + symbol (probably either at the center, or the origin of the part).</p>

<p>Here is what my schematic looks like after I have placed all of my parts.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%209.png"></p>

<h3 id="33-placing-the-ground-label">3.3. Placing the Ground Label</h3>

<p>The standard for schematics is to use a specialty component to label the shared ground. You can find this by searching â€œgndâ€� in the Add Part menu.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2010.png"></p>

<p>I will usually place one of these per component, just off the bottom of the component, and wire them to the ground pin.</p>

<h2 id="34-wiring-using-labels">3.4. Wiring using Labels</h2>

<p>You can directly connect parts together using the â€œNetâ€� tool (Green line) however with more than a few parts, this will very quickly become unmanageable. Instead of doing that, I will show you how to use labels to cleanly connect parts together. Note that for some components I will not use labels for connections, this makes sense for analog circuits, or things like pull down resistors because they can be logically grouped together.</p>

<p>For every node that I want to connect, I will first draw a one or two unit Net. Like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png" alt="/images/how-to-pcb-part-1/Untitled%2011.png"></p>

<p>Then using the â€œNameâ€� tool I will name all of the new nets something that makes them easier to keep track of. To name a net, select the tool, then select the green line for the net, a text dialogue should …</p></div></div></div>

When a domain is configured to receive mails usually a DNS record of the type MX is configured pointing to the host name of the mail server.</p><p>

Notably, according to the respective <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035">RFC 1035</a> the MX record must contain a domain name and may not directly point to an IP address. However some mail servers do configure an IP address. Many mail servers are lenient when it comes to this misconfiguration and will deliver mails nevertheless, so this may stay undetected.</p><p>

I happen to use a mail server that is less forgiving (Courier), and every now and then I cannot send a mail due to this. It’s rare, but it does happen. If your mail server has such a configuration you may not receive some legitimate e-mails.</p><p>

So I’m hoping to raise some awareness and get some of those servers fixed.</p><ul><li>Obviously if you run a mail and DNS server please don’t do this and correctly set your MX records.</li><li>If you do any kind of IT service or consulting that is related to mail and DNS servers this is a good thing to add to your list of things to check regularly (here's a <a href="https://github.com/hannob/ipmx">very simple python script you can use</a>).</li><li>If you run any form of service or tool that checks DNS and mail servers for misconfigurations, please add a check for IP addresses in MX records and warn your users. Unfortunately only few services do this currently (thanks to <a href="https://www.hardenize.com/">Hardenize</a> and <a href="https://intodns.com/">IntoDNS</a> who will warn users about this), and some popular services don’t.</li></ul><p>

I did a quick scan of the Alexa Top 1 Million list. Currently <a href="https://github.com/hannob/ipmx/blob/main/scans/ipmx-2021-02-20.txt">around 0,06 % are affected</a> (if you happen to know someone responsible for a host on this list please consider pointing them to this blogpost).

February 21, 2021 | https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/fpga-rasterizer.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/fpga-rasterizer.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>The Alice 4 rasterizer is broken into two main parts:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="https://lkesteloot.github.io/alice/alice4/libgl.html">software library</a> linked with the C application program. The library
                    implements the IrisGL API. It performs transformations, lighting, clipping,
                    and retained mode (display lists). Its output is a list of commands
                    (clear screen, draw triangle, swap buffers, etc.) that it writes to
                    memory outside Linux's range.</li>
                <li>An FPGA configuration that reads these commands from SDRAM and
                    executes them. For triangles it interpolates color (RGB) and depth
                    (Z). The FPGA also scans out the image buffer to the
                    LCD and performs other minor tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Buffers</h2>

            <p>There are three image buffers in shared memory:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A front color buffer, which is displayed to the user via the LCD.
                The scanning is continuous because the LCD has no memory of its own.
                The timing and wire format is similar to VGA.</li>
                <li>A back color buffer, which is being rasterized into.</li>
                <li>A depth buffer, used along with the back buffer during rasterization.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The first two buffers are only virtually “front” and “back”. Those two
            labels switch every frame as the back buffer becomes the new front
            buffer and is shown to the user.</p>

            <h2>Modules</h2>

            <p>The Verilog code is broken into about a dozen modules:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Main: Integrates all the other modules.
                    <ul>
                        <li>soc_instance: Module generated by Qsys to interface with
                            SDRAM and I<sup>2</sup>C.</li>
                        <li>LCD_control: Generates LCD control signals (H-Sync, V-Sync,
                            pixel enable, next frame signal, X coordinate, Y coordinate).
                            This runs at 25&nbsp;MHz (about 50&nbsp;FPS). It could run faster (up to 40&nbsp;MHz)
                            but the board clock is 50&nbsp;MHz, so it was convenient to
                            divide that by two and avoid having asynchronous clocks.</li>
                        <li>LCD_text: Given screen pixel X and Y, returns character X and Y
                            (text column and row) and sub-character X and Y.</li>

            <h2>Memory controller</h2>

            <p>The Altera Cyclone V SoC has a wonderful memory controller for accessing
            the synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM). It has a port for the ARM and six ports
            for the FPGA. Each FPGA port can be configured for input or output, and their
            relative priorities (including the ARM port) can be set. The priorities were
            critical for making sure the front-buffer scan-out was never starved of
            pixels. The SDRAM itself ran so fast (400&nbsp;MHz DDR) that all the ports could
            be active and not stall too often. The ports were set up as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reading the front-buffer for LCD scan-out. This was configured
                to be the highest priority.</li>
                <li>Reading the graphics command buffer.</li>
                <li>Reading the depth buffer for the pixel being rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the color of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
                <li>Writing the depth of the pixel just rasterized.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All five ports were hooked up to FIFOs to minimize the effects of
            memory latency.</p>

            <h2>Rasterization</h2>

            <p>Rasterization uses the edge-equation technique. The idea is to test every
            pixel to see whether it's inside the triangle. “Inside” is defined as “on the
            same side of every edge”. Only pixels in the bounding box of the triangle are
            tested. This technique wastes at least 50% of its time on pixels outside the
            triangle, but it's simpler to implement than edge-walkers.</p>

            <p>The state machine in <tt>Rasterizer.v</tt> reads commands from SDRAM
            (indirectly through the FIFO) and executes them. Because the SDRAM interface
            is (logically) 64 bits wide, and each pixel takes 32 bits (8 bits each of
            red, green, and blue, with 8 bits wasted), we always rasterize two pixels
            at a time. At 50&nbsp;MHz, that's 100 million pixels per second, but with (at least)
            half of them wasted, that's at most 50 million drawn pixels per second.</p>

            <p>To minimize SDRAM latency stalls, we use three FIFOs in the rasterization
            process:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The Command FIFO queues the drawing commands so that the
                    state machine need not block too long.</li>
                <li>The Read FIFO queues drawn pixels while we wait for the
                    depth read to return. After determining that a pixel is
                    inside the triangle, we initiate a read of its
                    corresponding depth value (if depth-comparison is enabled
                    for this triangle). This can take some time (tens of clocks) and we don't
                    want to block the rasterizer. Instead, we queue up all the
                    information we have about this pixel (depth memory address,
                    depth value, color memory address, and color) and move on to the
                    next pixel.
                    Another module (<tt>Read_FIFO.v</tt>) waits for the SDRAM read
                    to return. Since SDRAM reads return in the order they were
                    made, the module then gets the next item in our FIFO,
                    compares the depth values, and if the new pixel is closer to
                    the camera than the existing pixel, enqueues the same pixel
                    information into the Write FIFO. (All of this is done two
                    pixels at a time.)</li>
                <li>The Write FIFO queues pixels that must be written back to SDRAM.
                    The pixel's color must be written, and optionally the depth value
                    must be written (if enabled for this triangle). This is a complicated
                    module because we must take into account whether there are pixels
                    in the FIFO to write, whether the depth memory controller is ready
                    to accept another write, and whether the color memory controller is
                    ready to accept another write. See the section “Write FIFO” below
                    for details.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's very little stalling in this pipeline, so we end up with a
            rasterization rate of about 50 million Gouraud (color-interpolated)
            Z-buffered pixels per second. The triangle overhead lets us do
            almost 2 million (empty) triangles per second. It's hard to compare
            these numbers to
            <a href="http://www.sgidepot.co.uk/gfxtables.html">real SGI machines</a>, 
            but we seem to be matching the performance of machines built in the
            early 1990s.</p>

            <h2>Reciprocal</h2>

            <p>For each triangle, the rasterizer computes its on-screen area, then takes
            the reciprocal of the area. This is necessary for the normalization of
            the barycentric coordinates used to interpolate color and depth.
            <a href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/rasterization-stage">Scratchapixel</a> has a great explanation
            of how this works; scroll down to the “Barycentric Coordinates” section.</p>

            <p>To compute the reciprocal we use the built-in
            <a href="https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/ug/ug_lpm_alt_mfug.pdf"><tt>lpm_divide</tt></a> module:</p>

            <pre>lpm_divide
    #(.LPM_WIDTHN(32),
      .LPM_WIDTHD(32),
      .LPM_NREPRESENTATION("UNSIGNED"),
      .LPM_DREPRESENTATION("SIGNED"),
      .LPM_PIPELINE(6)) area_divider(
        .clock(clock),
        .clken(area_reciprocal_enabled),
        .numer(32'h7FFF_FFFF),
        .denom(tri_area),
        .quotient(tri_area_recip_result)
    );
            </pre>

            <p>The module is configured to have six pipeline stages, which means that
            the result will come out six clocks after the denominator was put in.
            We don't pipeline (overlap) our reciprocals (we only need one per triangle), but our
            state machine must wait six clocks for this result. We found the
            number 6 by trying various values until the compiler stopped complaining
            about timing violations.</p>

            <h2>Write FIFO</h2>

            <p>The Write FIFO, which writes pixel data to the back color buffer and
            to the depth buffer, was one of the most difficult modules to write in
            this project. Conceptually the state machine should perform these
            steps in a loop:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Wait for a new pixel to be available in the Write FIFO.</li>
                <li>Write it to the back color buffer and to the depth buffer.</li>
                <li>Wait for both SDRAM controller ports to acknowledge that they had
                    accepted the writes.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Remember that wherever we talk about “a pixel” here, we mean two

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>This year, 2021, is the 50th anniversary of the first single-chip microprocessor's invention, the Intel 4004. The official birthday of the 4004 was November 15th, 1971, when it was announced to the public. There are other pretenders to the throne, but only the 4004 meets all of the key criteria to be considered the first. I offer multiple ways to become a proud owner of a fully-functional, genuine, new Intel 4004 microprocessor.</p>
<p>I offer two ways to acquire an Intel 4004. The first way is that I incorporate an Intel 4004 chip into an artwork, called a ChipScape. These ChipScape artworks have an image of the tiny 4004 chip itself and have technical information about 4004 and its creation story. I offer different styles to appeal to different interests, price points, and artistic tastes. These make great gifts for anyone who has an interest in computer technology.</p>
<p>The second way is&nbsp;that I offer just the chips. Here you have two choices: the Intel P4004 and the Intel D4004. Both types have the same chip on the inside, but their packaging is different. The P4004 is made from a black plastic resin and is the more "common" version available. Within the P4004, I offer different date codes (when this chip was made, the earlier, the more valuable) and different manufacturing locations (where the chip was made, this is purely a collector preference). The D4004 is made using a gray ceramic package. It was made to be more rugged and is much rarer.</p>
<p>I get lots of questions about the C4004. I don't have any of the C4004s available as chips, just in artworks (only a couple). C4004s are made with white ceramic and gold plated leads and caps. They are rare. Prices for&nbsp;good working versions can range from $1,000 to $5,000.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most who entered college in the mid-aughts, I was taken by Facebook. It had a sleek interface. All my friends from high school and college were on it, being super cool with edgy profile pics. I browsed my newsfeed everyday — probably for years. But, starting the early 2010s, I noticed an inverse correlation. The more friend requests I received from long lost aunties and uncles, the fewer posts I would see from my peers. It was almost like the aunties and uncles were driving them away.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg" alt="Facebook friended by mom" src="https://consult.sauvik.me/assets/post-images/facebook-mom.jpg"></p><p>There’s a concept in social psychology known as an illusory correlation <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Illusory correlations are sort of like stereotypes for relationships between two variables — if enough of a certain type of person does activity X or uses thing Y, then other people start to associate activity X or thing Y as being only for that certain type of person. More concretely, if enough aunties and uncles seem to use Facebook (relative to other demographics), then non-aunties-and-uncles start thinking that Facebook must only be for aunties and uncle. At best, the correlation is silly; at worst, it is pernicious. Whatever it is, its effects are often unconscious and real.</p><p>Now, I want you to close your eyes and think about the first person who comes to mind when you think about the attribute “security conscious” or “concerned about privacy”. Readers of this blog may be biased; but, for many non-experts, the person they think about may look something like this:</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FiVHfwLc.gif&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="Printer Hacker"></p><p>And therein lies the illusory correlation in consumer security.</p><p>If you’ll allow me a moment to be more formal: early adopters of security and privacy features are usually those who are especially concerned about security and privacy. Perhaps this is because they genuinely have some sensitive information to keep away from prying eyes. Perhaps they are simply risk averse. Whatever the reason, many non-experts describe these early adopters and security experts more generally as “nutty” or “paranoid”. A classic example of this comes from Shirley Gaw and colleagues study on encrypted email usage in the workplace <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. The authors found that if someone used encrypted email but did not have a “good” reason for doing so (e.g., if they were only asking about lunch), they were perceived by their colleagues as being “paranoid.” I found something similar in my own research <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>: experts felt hesitant about sharing security advice with non-experts to avoid being perceived as “nutty”. The upshot? If only “nutty” or “paranoid” people use security features, and <em>I</em> am not nutty or paranoid…well, those security or privacy features must not be for me.</p><p>In short, early adopters of security features may —&nbsp;subtly or overtly — be perceived as paranoid by others; in turn, this stigma can cause non-experts to “disaffiliate” from security. This is what I call the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis in end-user security. I call it a hypothesis because it has not been tested it in a randomized, controlled experiment <sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>; but, there is a good bit of observational evidence to back it up.</p><p>When I worked at Facebook, for example, I ran an analysis of how one’s friends use of security features like two-factor authentication affected one’s own use of two-factor authentication <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. I found a surprising effect: for the vast majority of people, social influence appeared to have a <em>negative</em> effect on one’s own adoption of two-factor authentication. In other words, for the vast majority of people, the presence of N friends who used two-factor authentication made them less likely to use two-factor authentication than if they had fewer than N friends who used two-factor authentication.</p><p>This is a surprising result. Typically, social “proof” tends to have a positive effect —&nbsp;if more of my friends use X, I should be more likely to use X myself. But, my research suggests that this more “typical” effect of social influence does not come to fruition for typical security tools until many of one’s friends start using security tools (e.g., as demonstrated by the recent WhatsApp exodus to Signal). Social influence for security behaviors is sort of like quantum mechanics in physics: the rules that apply at large scale do not apply at small scale.</p><p>So what can we do? My research suggests that one of the key drivers of the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis is the unfounded assumption that only geeks use security features. This image of the shady security geek is pernicious, and has been amplified by popular depictions of “hackers”. We also happen to live in a culture that values openness and transparency —&nbsp;”I’ve Got Nothing to Hide”, tired as it is as an argument against privacy, is seen as a badge of honor. But this notion of privacy and security being only for shady geeks is dangerous, and does more harm than good.</p><p>There is hope, though. My research suggests that the paranoia-disaffiliation hypothesis does <em>not</em> hold for security and privacy systems that are designed to be more social: i.e., those that can be easily observed when used, that involve others in the process of providing security, or that allow us to act in benefit of others. By making security and privacy more social, we start to associate security and privacy with more desirable social properties — e.g., altruism, leadership, and responsibility. And if people stop viewing the security conscious as shady geeks, and start viewing them as altruistic leaders, perhaps we can overcome the paranoia-disaffiliation effect.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2><p>Reaching decentralized consensus is hard. Really, there must be a reason why Bitcoin network is such an energy-inefficient monster with its Proof-of-Work algorithm. Of course, many other consensus algorithms exist that are not that power-hungry, for example, Proof-of-Stake variations. But they require some sort of centralization, usually hidden under details and complexity. And they still have limits, a boundary on the total number of transactions per second that a network can process.</p><p>I don’t believe it’s possible to find an efficient consensus algorithm, which would be truly decentralized. But why restrict ourselves to just software solutions? Here I want to explain that a super-efficient hardware solution exists. And it’s already within the reach of our current technologies.</p><h2 id="2-the-main-problem">2. The Main Problem</h2><p>What is the root cause of why it’s so hard to achieve a decentralized consensus?</p><p>Well, in the case of cryptocurrencies it’s called <em>double spending</em>. If Clara has 100 coins at some point in time then she can’t spend 200 coins – the network will just ignore such transaction as incorrect. But transferring 100 coins to Alice or 100 coins to Bob are both correct transactions. Yet they are conflicting. If Clara simultaneously commits both these transactions then the network has to decide what to choose as the right one and what to discard.</p><p>Making a decision based on time is not a deterministic way, because some participants can receive one of the conflicting transactions earlier in time, while the others will see a different order.</p><p>Somehow the whole network, i.e. every participant of it, has to decide what to pick as the correct transaction in a way, that will be in agreement with the decisions of every other participant.</p><p>This decision can’t be based on some mathematical function of a transaction (if Clara has enough freedom of composing it). For example, we can’t have a rule where we pick the transaction of 100 coins to Alice as correct because <em>A &lt; B</em>. Because if Clara commits another conflicting transaction of 100 coins to Aaron later in time, then the whole network would have to change its decisions.</p><p>Note that the same problem exists in a broader context, not related to currencies. For example, you can have a blockchain network where users can play chess games. At any moment in time a player has a set of allowable moves. But a player is allowed to choose only one move. If he commits two moves simultaneously, then, again, the network has to decide what to pick as the right one.</p><p>There are many consensus algorithms invented, but they are just ways to centralize a network, where these conflict resolution decisions are made by some selected (or elected) set of participants. In fact, Bitcoin PoW consensus algorithm is a form of election of a participant (miner), whose decision will be set as correct for the whole network.</p><hr><p>So, how can we use hardware to solve this problem?</p><p>Imagine hypothetical hardware that additionally signs Clara’s transactions (via some cryptographic microchips). Moreover, this hardware keeps a counter of Clara’s transactions and <em>attaches</em> this number to a signed transaction. So, the network will see a transaction with its number that has two signatures – the one by Clara’s private key and another one by hardware private key.</p><p>Conflict resolution is trivial in this case. The network will accept a transaction that has a lower counter (it has to be +1 of the previous transaction number).</p><p>The main assumption that we need for network security is that Clara can’t tamper hardware or simulate it in some way. Of course, making tamper-proof hardware is also a hard task, but the technology is almost there. There are a lot of tamper-resistant USB keys that are already on the market.</p><p>Actually, FIDO keys are already satisfying our blockchain needs!</p><h2 id="3-fido-keys">3. FIDO keys</h2><p>FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) is an alliance of the world’s major IT companies. They developed U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) – an open standard of two-factor authentification that uses USB or NFC keys. Luckily, this standard is indeed universal. Even though it was developed as an addition to password authentification in centralized services, we can use it in a blockchain network instead!</p><p>A nice overview of U2F protocol you can see <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html">here</a>.</p><p>In particular, look at this diagram</p><p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/auth_flow4.svg" alt="Mobile View"><em>https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html</em></p><p>It is supposed that a Relying Party (server) starts second-factor authentification by sending a <em>challenge</em> to a client. But blockchain network has no servers. Instead of a challenge, Clara uses the hash of her transaction, where <em>app_id</em> is just a name of the blockchain network and <em>handle</em> is Clara’s personal public key. Then the U2F device will update the counter and return the signed transaction with the attached counter. This is exactly what we need! Clara then sends this information along with the actual transaction and her own signature to the network.</p><p>To ensure that Clara can’t simulate the device, U2F protocol additionally includes the attestation certificate of the device manufacturer, as explained <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-technotes-the-truth-about-attestation/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="4-typical-usage-scenario">4. Typical usage scenario</h2><p>First of all, a user has to register in the network. To do this, he needs to have FIDO hardware key and to generate his personal private/public keys. The registration is essentially linking personal keys with device keys. For this, an empty challenge can be used in the device signing flow.</p><p>Making transactions was described in the previous section.</p><p>If the device is lost/broken/stolen then the user can register another device with its personal key. Though, in this case, the network should wait for some time, for example, 24 hours, to be sure that the previous device (in a couple with the personal key) is not used anymore.</p><h2 id="5-threats">5. Threats</h2><p>Since every transaction must have two signatures – by device and user, the device alone can’t be used to harm its user.</p><p>But an incorrect or tampered device can be used to submit conflicting transactions to the network (for example, with the same counter). This will split the network if no other consensus algorithm is involved.</p><p>But we can assume that manufacturer has no incentives to make incorrect devices to harm the network.</p><p>So, the only threat is device tampering. Even though modern FIDO keys are tamper-resistant, their security is probably not enough to be used in blockchain networks, because there were no reasons to make them fully tamper-proof in usage with centralized servers. But nearly tamper-proof technology is certainly possible.</p><h2 id="6-super-efficiency">6. (Super) Efficiency</h2><p>As for this blockchain efficiency, it’s certainly unreachable for ordinary blockchains. Because in this architecture, no additional communication to resolve possible conflicts is needed <strong><em>AT ALL</em></strong>. Every possible conflict is resolved immediately in an independent and coherent fashion.</p><h2 id="7-final-words">7. Final Words</h2><p>This is, of course, only a high-level overview of blockchain architecture. A lot of details are skipped. But I hope it can be seen that this architecture is a real solution to a lot of blockchain problems.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26214175">Discussion</a> on HackerNews.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><small>Unsharpen may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.</small></p><div>

                                
                                <p>The Sharpie S-Gel is a relatively new gel pen that was first released in early 2020. Sharpie, being known for its permanent markers, has produced pens for some time, but those have mostly been fiber-tipped, marker-like pens. These pens, which are essentially just thin Sharpie markers, developed a solid following, they were simply an extension of the Sharpie marker’s popularity.</p>
<p>And then came the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/sharpie-s-gel/">S-Gel</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gels_Origin">S-Gel’s Origin</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel is one of a huge number of retractable gel pens, so why was it able to come along and gain such popularity? The pen is sold in normal ink colors (black, blue, red, green, and purple) and a normal set of tip sizes (0.38 mm, 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, and 1.0 mm / ultra fine, fine, medium, bold). The S-Gel is priced competitively, but isn’t particularly cheap at about 80 cents a pen, depending on the pack you buy.</p>

<h2><span id="S-Gel_Ink">S-Gel Ink</span></h2>
<p>The S-Gel ink offers the smooth writing experience you’d expect from a gel pen, but you’d be hard-pressed to call it extraordinary. Yes, it’s a high performance gel pen, but does it really offer an exceptional writing experience when compared to a <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/zebra-sarasa-grand/">Zebra Sarasa</a> or <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pentel-energel-alloy-gel/">Pentel Energel</a> or any of today’s other best gel pens?</p>
<p>Having used the blue and black gel ink colors extensively in both the standard black model, as well as the metal body executive version and the frosted blue barrel, I can say this is a very good gel pen and one I like using, but it’s not anything that we haven’t seen before. The pens are refillable, but refills aren’t currently available online, making this is a moot point for now.</p>
<p>The ink is quick drying, but not as resistant to smear and bleed through as the Energel. The ink is intensely colored, but doesn’t seem remarkable compared to a Uni-ball Signo. The fine tip is smooth, but not particularly smooth relative to a Jetstream.</p>
<h2><span id="Non-Permanent_Ink">Non-Permanent Ink</span></h2>
<p>The pen has the obvious and someone concerning quality of not using permanent ink. Sharpie is a brand build on permanent ink, so not seeing this in their gel pen is odd. Perhaps the permanence would have needed pigmented ink, which would have meant the pen wouldn’t be the smoothest possible gel pen, but it’s still going to be a surprise for many buyers.</p>
<p>The S-Gel has a contoured rubber grip that is similar to the sneaker grip of the Pilot Acroball. It’s comfortable and it holds up well, despite looking like the sort of grip that will break down over time, and get the shiny, oily feel of disintegrating rubber.</p>
<p>Today the S-Gel is a full pen lineup but at launch, in January 2020, it was just two sizes and two colors. At the same time Sharpie launched a rollerball pen — the Roller Pen — that hasn’t seen anywhere near the same success.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="251" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-450x201.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-768x343.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-1536x687.jpg 1536w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Sharpie-S-Gel-01-2048x915.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"></a></p>
<h2><span id="So_What_Happened">So What Happened?</span></h2>
<p>So what caused the S-Gel, with its relatively standard black ink and blue ink in 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm sizes to become the most popular Sharpie pen and perhaps the best selling new gel ink pen in years? Online reviews point to appreciate for the pen as a good writer and a useful office pen, but few highlight it as being one of the most exception products of 2020.</p>
<p>The obvious factor we’ve yet to discuss it the strength of the Sharpie brand. Perhaps simply through brand recognition and reach of its distribution network (via its parent company Newell Brands, owners of Waterman, PaperMate, Rotring, and others) the Sharpie S-Gel was able to brute-force its way into strong place in the market for gel ink pens.</p>
<h3><span id="What_About_The_Roller_Pen">What About The Roller Pen?</span></h3>
<p>So why did the same not happen with the Roller Pen? It’s hard to say, but it’s clear from trends of the past 5+ years that the gel pen has been overtaking the rollerball in the US. Customer preference is a strong thing, and the shift to retractable gel pens from capped rollerballs seems to be undeniable. Perhaps larger market forces made the success of the S-Gel likely and the lack of success of the Roller Pen inevitable?</p>
<h3><span id="Playing_The_Game_Well">Playing The Game Well</span></h3>
<p>The Sharpie marketing engine seems to be in full force, with the S-Gel ranking for multiple top spots on Amazon for generic terms like “gel pen” and even winning the top result for “pens.” This is combined with aggressive advertising on Amazon search placements for pen-related terms as well as placement in almost all the big box office stores in the US.</p>
<p>So, yes, the Sharpie S-Gel is a good pen and far be it from us to say it’s not deserving of its success, but seeing one pen explode in popularity while so many other new products remain obscure or see just middling success certainly raised questions with anyone who watches the pen market.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Yes, it's yet another blog about issues with current technical hiring practices and what I'd like to see. First let's define the current Big Corp Hiring pipeline, which many other companies <a href="https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/cargo-cult-software-engineering/">love to copy</a>. Because we all know if we act like Google, we will be Google.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some sort of phone screen. I imagine this is to confirm you have a pulse, at least bothered to read what the company does, filter people with unpleasant voices, filter people with thick accents (which feels like racism to me), filter people who are too awkward, and other asinine reasons that essentially come down to "gut feeling". Frankly, I don't care if you're any of those things (well, you probably need a pulse, but I'm not a zombiest). I only care that you're pleasant to work with and competent. The great part about this is it's a "skill" hardened interviewers love to say they've "mastered" and they "just know" after a brief conversation with someone. Shockingly enough, these people never seem to self reflect on their accuracy saying "it's too hard to measure". It would actually be fairly easy to measure based on how many people who pass the phone screen ultimately fail the pipeline, or who are hired yet don't perform well, and/or checking where the candidates they didn't let through end up. Measuring would likely reveal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html">fairly poor accuracy</a> and systemic bias, so we'll skip that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A leet code question. This is to verify the person in question can "actually code". Programmers love to think most other programmers can't actually code and are dumb gorillas. What it's really testing is how well you can code while under extreme pressure, and that's <a href="https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/">actually very hard to do</a>. It may also be under the guise of "seeing how the candidates think" or "how they explain themselves". Truthfully, I don't care how candidates think, I care about their solution. They should be able to explain their solution, but I could care less if the way they got there is a lesser demon whispering in their ear. Humans are bad at explaining how they discovered a solution to a problem, and when they try to explain, they're likely not explaining how they really solved the problem. What's likely happening is their leet code muscle memory kicked in, and now they have to ad-hoc rationalize some made up explanation. Another thing interviewers love to do is poorly define the problem to make sure you can "gather requirements". If you're not privy to this common haze, of course you're an idiot and a no hire.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat step two a few times. This is to "gather signal". Really, it's to weed out the smart developers who may have had good enough intuition to solve a few leet code questions without grinding them a few hours every night. You don't want developers like that, you want developers who will shut up and do the leet code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A culture fit round! Yep, like the phone screen we can filter out awkward people or people who are the wrong color or gender. A culture fit round gives us a free pass to do this after they've already proven themselves to be technically competent. I don't know about you, but I cannot tell if someone is a "culture fit" or pleasant to work with after a short lunch. Many studies have already shown humans are notoriously bad at judging someone based on first impressions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tl;dr Hiring software devs is like choosing math professors based on how good they were at Math Olympiad. Clearly there's some correlation, but you'd be throwing away a lot of good professors.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Here are some options.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have a public repo and a board of open cases candidates can do. Pay them for their work if you do accept their PR. Give them code review and see how they respond. If you like the work they do, hire them fulltime. This is essentially lightweight contracting. It's representative of their actual skill. The bastardized version of this are 2 to 3 hour long unpaid "take homes" which are then thrown directly into the trash are incredibly disrespectful to the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let the candidate put forth their own work. Let them put forth whatever they want. Ask questions and take context into mind. Clearly a small personal project might not have an entire suite of tests and complicated CI/CD pipeline. Have the candidate do some code review on your own project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solve a problem together. Yep, solve a problem that you haven't perfectly rehearsed. As a smug interviewer looking to clap down candidates, this is incredibly scary, but representative of how working with a coworker actually is. When you and your coworker collaborate on a real problem, no one knows the answer before hand, you figure it out together. Let them lead, but work together as if this was your real coworker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It deeply saddens me that the current hiring process is the best we've come up with and we need to do better.</p>

<p>Python will be used to read SMS messages and forward them to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" target="_blank">Telegram Bot API</a>. Messages will be listened to by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wammu.eu/smsd/" target="_blank">Gammu</a> SMS service and it will trigger the Python script when an SMS message received.  </p>



<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>First of all, we have to enable communication between GSM hat and Raspberry PI Zero, run Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool (raspi-config);</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo raspi-config</code></pre>



<p>Then, follow following actions;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png" alt="" width="743" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1.png 990w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-1-768x474.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px"><figcaption>Go to Interface Options</figcaption></figure></div>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png" alt="" width="745" height="457" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2.png 993w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-300x184.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-2-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px"><figcaption>Select and enter P6 Serial Port</figcaption></figure>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png" alt="" width="740" height="458" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3.png 987w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-300x185.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-3-768x475.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Select No at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png" alt="" width="740" height="459" srcset="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4.png 986w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-300x186.png 300w, https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-4-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"><figcaption>Lastly, select Yes at this screen.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Exit configuration tool. Now we need to enable UART on raspberry pi. Shutdown and eject SD card to open in another computer. Open /boot/config.txt file, find the below statement and uncomment it to enable the UART. You can directly append it at the end of the file as well.</p>



<pre><code>enable_uart=1</code></pre>



<p>Now, reboot raspberry pi device and open the console to install Gammu SMS Deamon and Python PiP package installer. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip gammu-smsd</code></pre>



<p>Install Telegram Bot API python library.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo pip install python-telegram-bot==12.3.0</code></pre>



<p><em>Note: Version 12.3.0 is the latest version that is compatible with Python 2.7, if you want to use it with Python 3+ version, you can install the latest available version.</em></p>



<p>Now you need to create a bot in Telegram and obtain a token. Afterwards, start a chat with that bot in your Telegram account and send a test message to your bot. This will help us to identify your chat ID. </p>



<p>Open following URL with you Telegram Bot token and copy the chat ID in the response; </p>



<pre><code>https://api.telegram.org/bot[YOUR-BOT-TOKEN]/getUpdates</code></pre>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="269" height="29" src="https://mete.dev/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>This is your chat ID.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Save following script in /home/pi/forward-telegram.py;</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

</code></pre>



<p>Make python file executable</p>



<pre><code>$ chmod +x /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>Update Gammu SMS Deamon’s configuration to use GSM hat. Waveshare uses /dev/ttyS0 for communication. </p>



<pre><code>$ sudo nano /etc/gammu-smsdrc</code></pre>



<p>Find following lines in the configuration file and update with correct values, for me these values are following;</p>



<pre><code>port = /dev/ttyS0
connection = at115200</code></pre>



<p>Also, we need to specify the script path to be ran by Gammu so add following line below [smsd] section;</p>



<pre><code>RunOnReceive = /home/pi/forward-telegram.py</code></pre>



<p>You can find my complete configuration file <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mtrcn/045d7eeef1e38c092939d5ee87f96fb0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>



<p>Restart Gammu SMS service.</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl restart gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>



<p>That’s all! You should now able to get your SMS messages to your Telegram account. </p>



<p>You can monitor Gammu SMS service for any problem with the following command;</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo systemctl status gammu-smsd.service</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p><span>EAST WENATCHEE,&nbsp;Washington — Hands on the&nbsp;</span>wheel, eyes squinting against the winter sun, Lauren Miehe eases his Land Rover down the main drag and tells me how he used to spot promising sites to build a bitcoin mine, back in 2013, when he was a freshly arrived techie from Seattle and had just discovered this sleepy rural community.</p>
<p>The attraction then, as now, was the Columbia River, which we can glimpse a few blocks to our left. Bitcoin mining — the complex process in which computers solve a complicated math puzzle to win a stack of virtual currency — uses an inordinate amount of electricity, and thanks to five hydroelectric dams that straddle this stretch of the river, about three hours east of Seattle, miners could buy that power more cheaply here than anywhere else in the nation. Long before locals had even heard the words “cryptocurrency” or “blockchain,” Miehe and his peers realized that this semi-arid agricultural region known as the Mid-Columbia Basin was the best place to mine bitcoin in America — and maybe the world.</p>
<p>The trick, though, was finding a location where you could put all that cheap power to work. You needed an existing building, because in those days, when bitcoin was trading for just a few dollars, no one could afford to build something new. You needed space for a few hundred high-speed computer servers, and also for the heavy-duty cooling system to keep them from melting down as they churned out the trillions of calculations necessary to mine bitcoin. Above all, you needed a location that could handle a lot of electricity — a quarter of a megawatt, maybe, or even a half a megawatt, enough to light up a couple hundred homes.</p>
<p>The best mining sites were the old fruit warehouses — the basin is as famous for its apples as for its megawatts — but those got snapped up early. So Miehe, a tall, gregarious 38-year-old who would go on to set up a string of mines here, learned to look for less obvious solutions. He would roam the side streets and back roads, scanning for defunct businesses that might have once used a lot of power. An old machine shop, say. A closed-down convenience store. Or this: Miehe slows the Land Rover and points to a shuttered carwash sitting forlornly next to a Taco Bell. It has the space, he says. And with the water pumps and heaters, “there’s probably a ton of power distributed not very far from here,” Miehe tells me. “That could be a bitcoin mine.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past two years, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown.</p></blockquote>
<p>These days, Miehe says, a serious miner wouldn’t even look at a site like that. As bitcoin’s soaring price has drawn in <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/09/how-bitcoin-works-illustration-infographic-217333" target="_blank">thousands of new players worldwide</a>, the strange math at the heart of this cryptocurrency has grown steadily more complicated. Generating a single bitcoin takes a lot more servers than it used to — and a lot more power. Today, a half-megawatt mine, Miehe says, “is nothing.” The commercial miners now pouring into the valley are building sites with tens of thousands of servers and electrical loads of as much as 30 megawatts, or enough to power a neighborhood of 13,000 homes. And in the arms race that cryptocurrency mining has become, even these operations will soon be considered small-scale. Miehe knows of substantially larger mining projects in the basin backed by out-of-state investors from Wall Street, Europe and Asia whose prospecting strategy, as he puts it, amounts to “running around with a checkbook just trying to get in there and establish scale.”</p>
<p>For years, few residents really grasped how appealing their region was to miners, who mainly did their esoteric calculations quietly tucked away in warehouses and basements. But those days are gone. Over the past two years, and especially during 2017, when the price of a single bitcoin&nbsp;<a href="https://99bitcoins.com/price-chart-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped</a>&nbsp;from $1,000 to more than $19,000, the region has taken on the vibe of a boomtown. Across the three rural counties of the Mid-Columbia Basin — Chelan, Douglas and Grant — orchards and farm fields now share the rolling landscape with mines of every size, from industrial-scale facilities to repurposed warehouses to cargo containers and even backyard sheds. Outsiders are so eager to turn the basin’s power into cryptocurrency that this winter, several would-be miners from Asia flew their private jet into the local airport, took a rental car to one of the local dams, and, according to a utility official, politely informed staff at the dam visitors center, “We want to see the dam master because we want to buy some electricity.”</p>
<p>The Mid-Columbia Basin isn’t the only location where the virtual realm of cryptocurrency is colliding with the real world of megawatts and real estate. In places like China, Venezuela and Iceland, cheap land and even cheaper electricity have resulted in bustling mining hubs. But the basin, by dint of its early start, has emerged as one of the biggest boomtowns. By the end of 2018, according to some estimates, miners here could account for anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all bitcoin mining in the world, and impressive shares of other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple. And as with any boomtown, that success has created tensions. There have been disputes between miners and locals, bankruptcies and bribery attempts, lawsuits, even a kind of intensifying guerrilla warfare between local utility crews and a shadowy army of bootleg miners who set up their servers in basements and garages and max out the local electrical grids.</p>

<p>More broadly, the region is watching uneasily as one of its biggest natural resources — a gigantic surplus of hydroelectric power — is inhaled by a sector that barely existed five years ago and which is routinely derided as the next dot-com bust, or this century’s version of the Dutch tulip craze, or, as&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;columnist Paul Krugman&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/955107120671797248?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it in January</a>, a Ponzi scheme. Indeed, even as Miehe was demonstrating his prospecting chops, bitcoin’s price was already in a swoon that would touch $5,900 and rekindle widespread doubts about the future of virtual currencies.</p>
<p>For local cryptocurrency enthusiasts, these slings and arrows are all very much worth enduring. They believe not only that cryptocurrency will make them personally very wealthy, but also that this formerly out-of-the-way region has a real shot at becoming a center — and maybe&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>center — of a coming technology revolution, with the well-paid jobs and tech-fueled prosperity that usually flow only to gilded “knowledge” hubs like Seattle and San Francisco. Malachi Salcido, a Wenatchee building contractor who jumped into bitcoin in 2014 and is now one of the basin’s biggest players, puts it in sweeping terms. The basin, he tells me, is “building a platform that the entire world is going to use.”</p>
<p>And squarely between these two competing narratives are the communities of the Mid-Columbia Basin, which find themselves anxiously trying to answer a question that for most of the rest of us is merely an amusing abstraction: Is bitcoin for real?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><b>A few miles from the shuttered carwash</b>, David Carlson stands at the edge of a sprawling construction site and watches workers set the roof on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfrjhflKGzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giga Pod</a>, a self-contained crypto mine that Carlson designed to be assembled in a matter of weeks. When finished, the prefabricated wood-frame structure, roughly 12 by 48 feet, will be equipped with hundreds of high-speed servers that collectively draw a little over a megawatt of power and, in theory, will be capable of producing around 80 bitcoins a month. Carlson himself won’t be the miner; his company, Giga-Watt, will run the pod as a hosting site for other miners. By summer, Giga-Watt expects to have 24 pods here churning out bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, most of which use the same computing-intensive, cryptographically secured protocol called the blockchain. “We’re right where the rubber hits the road with blockchain,” Carlson shouts as we step inside the project’s first completed pod and stand between the tall rack of toaster-size servers and a bank of roaring cooling fans. The main use of blockchain technology now is to keep a growing electronic ledger of every single bitcoin transaction ever made. But many miners see it as the record-keeping mechanism of the future. “We’re where the blockchain goes from that virtual concept to something that’s real in the world,” says Carlson, “something that somebody had to build and is actually running.”</p>
<p>Granted, all that real-worlding and road-hitting is a little hard to visualize just now. The winter storms that have turned the Cascade Mountains a dazzling white have also turned the construction site into a reddish quagmire that drags at workers and equipment. There have also been permitting snafus, delayed utility hookups, and a lawsuit, recently settled, by impatient investors. But Carlson seems unperturbed. “They are actually making it work,” he told me earlier, referring to the mud-caked workers. “In a normal project, they might just say, ‘Let’s just wait till spring,’” Carlson adds. “But in bitcoin and blockchain, there is no stopping.” Indeed, demand for hosting services in the basin is so high that a desperate miner offered Carlson a Lamborghini if Carlson would bump him to the head of the pod waiting list. “I didn’t take the offer,” Carlson assures me. “And I like Lamborghinis!”</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the expanding bitcoin universe, lots of miners are turning their basements and spare bedrooms into jury-rigged data centers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carlson has become the face of the Mid-Columbia Basin crypto boom. Articulate, infectiously optimistic, with graying hair and a trim beard, the Microsoft software developer-turned-serial entrepreneur has built a series of mines, made (and lost) several bitcoin fortunes and endured countless setbacks to become one of the region’s largest players. Other local miners credit Carlson for launching the basin’s boom, back in 2012, when he showed …</p></div></div>

		<p>Most of the digital products we use today are designed for our eyes, simply because as highly visual beings, we rely on our sight a lot.</p>

<p>Whether we’re reading microcopy to understand what a button does, or scanning through textual instructions to familiarize with a new machine, interacting with devices using visual cues is what we’re very used to.</p>
<p>But what happens when visual feedback is secondary? How does that change the way we interact with interfaces, and the way they’re designed for us?</p>
<p>Voice User Interfaces (VUI) like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant are designed differently from screen-first interfaces for many reasons — the main one being that the principles of spoken communication differ from those of written communication. Because of that, UX designers cannot approach voice-first interfaces the same way they do screen-first interfaces.</p>
<p>How and why should they be done differently? Let’s dive into some of the best practices in voice design.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Practices in Voice Design</strong></h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/alexa-design/get-started.html">Amazon’s Alexa Design Guide</a>, voice interfaces should be four things — adaptable, personal, relatable, and available. Both Amazon’s guide and <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/df-asdk/design">Google Assistant’s Conversation design guide</a> stress that voice-first skills should be natural and user-centric for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the best practices in designing user experiences for voice user interfaces.</p>
<h3>1. Be Flexible and Receptive</h3>
<p>Language is dynamic. Let’s say a user wants to make a call, they can say <em>“Call X”</em>, <em>“Ring X”</em>, <em>“Get X on the phone”</em>, or a thousand more other variations that can be matched to the same “Call” intent. Your skill must be able to pick up on key details in varied utterances, even if there are multiple embedded in a single answer.</p>
<p>Sometimes, to save time, users may string multiple pieces of information in a single command or response to a question. For example, if one says…</p>
<p><em>“Set a reminder for my interview with Snappymob at 3pm tomorrow.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>…they likely don’t want to repeat any of the information they’ve already mentioned. It’d show a lack of receptiveness to follow the exchange with <em>“What time would you like to set your reminder for?”</em> or <em>“What’s the reminder for?”</em>, because then the user would have to repeat <em>“3pm”</em> or <em>“Interview with Snappymob”</em>.</p>
<p>When your interface is able to pick up on additional information that wasn’t asked for, and fill in the gaps unprompted, you create a more intuitive experience for your users.</p>
<h3>2. Ask Questions, One at a Time</h3>
<p>Simply speaking, users need to know when their cue is. With voice-activated devices, asking questions lets them know when they need to respond.</p>
<p>Phrasing in statements rather than questions, like <em>“Let me know where you would like to go.”</em> instead of <em>“Where would you like to go?”</em> makes it unclear if the user needs to prompt the next activity with an answer.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion on both sides, it’s also standard to ask for one piece of information at a time. For instance, asking a user <em>“What is your new contact’s name, mobile number, and email address?”</em> might cause information overload and make forming an answer difficult. Instead, ask single-answer questions to fill in the blanks one by one.</p>
<h3>3. Present Clear Options</h3>
<p>Unlike visual interfaces, with voice-first, users aren’t choosing from navigation menus they can visually scan through. Hence, it’s important to relay their options in a clear and concise manner. This is where you need to pay attention to language.</p>
<p>Syntax matters especially with distinguishing between either/or questions and yes/no questions. For example, <em>“Would you like twister fries or french fries to go with your meal?”</em> could sound like a yes or no question. Instead, to make the option prompt clearer, it could be phrased like <em>“Which side would you like: Twister fries or french fries?”</em>.</p>
<h3>4. Narrow Down to Only the Necessary</h3>
<p>This applies to both questions and choices. Text can be scanned through, but spoken words take time to relay — so be succinct.</p>
<p>Only ask for confirmation for actions with high importance, like making calls, sending text messages, and any action that involves recipients or monetary transactions.</p>
<p>Asking for unnecessary confirmation or making users reiterate information can easily frustrate them. For example, an <em>“Are you sure” </em>confirmation might not be necessary for simple commands like <em>“Turn off the lights”</em> or <em>“Tell me the current price for Bitcoin”</em>, but necessary for <em>“Send email” </em>and <em>“Call Cindy”</em>.</p>
<p>As for choices, make sure your users aren’t bombarded with ten choices at a time. Remember that unlike text, users can’t scan back and forth to digest a message with speech. Giving them too much information to process at a time will lead to more errors in comprehension and exchange.</p>
<h3>5. Restate Questions</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, on voice-first interfaces, users aren’t relying primarily on a visual navigation menu. So to make sure they know where they are, it’s always helpful to reinstate the questions they answer.</p>
<p>For example, when a user asks for the recipe for spaghetti bolognese, it’s clearer to respond with <em>“To make spaghetti bolognese, the ingredients are…”</em> instead of jumping straight into <em>“The ingredients are…”</em>. A simple restatement reassures the user that they’re getting the answer they’re looking for.</p>
<h3>6. Be Prepared for Blockers</h3>
<p>Being well-prepared includes being prepared for scenarios where things don’t go as planned. Here are some of the most common blockers to think ahead for when designing for voice user interfaces:</p>
<h3><strong>Corrections</strong></h3>
<p>When a VUI gets a piece of information wrong, users will naturally correct it with common phrases like <em>“No, I said-”</em> or a simply a reiteration of their command.</p>
<p>Your interface must be able to pick up on corrections, accept them instantaneously, and restate the command for confirmation.</p>
<h3><strong>Comprehension Failures</strong></h3>
<p>When the VUI fails to understand the user’s command, it’s important to handle the error with grace.</p>
<p>The standard way to approach this is with a statement followed by a repetition of the question, like <em>“Sorry, I didn’t catch that. Who would you like to share this link with?”</em>. This is to make it clear to the user that they should reiterate their answer following the cue.</p>
<h3><strong>Unavailable Functions</strong></h3>
<p>When a user asks for a function that doesn’t exist, instead of using the standard <em>“Sorry, I didn’t get that”</em> response repeatedly, let them know what can be done for them instead to move the conversation forward.</p>
<p>Here’s a scenario — a user says <em>“Cook me spaghetti”</em>. Instead of ending the exchange with “Sorry, I couldn’t understand that”, respond with <em>“I can only help you find recipes for spaghetti. Would you like me to look for the best ones?”.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Non-Responses</strong></h3>
<p>Sometimes users forget to answer, or abandon ship halfway through a conversation. Some other times, the VUI doesn’t pick up on the sound input. In situations like these, re-prompts are necessary to give the user another go at answering a question, in case the non-response wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>In the re-prompts, it’s important to restate where they left off, so they know where to pick up. For example, a user doesn’t respond after saying <em>“Set a reminder”</em>. The re-prompt should restate what the user’s intent was, and what they should do next, something like this — <em>“I can help you set a reminder. What would you like to be reminded for?”</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Belief in the context of this article is free of any spiritual or religious meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article's idea is inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Blazor/comments/l89iit/blazor_server_logging_from_service/">reddit thread</a>, I participated. The specific topic is not relevant but the reactions of one group of people, started by the statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Making a service static is the worst idea you could've possibly done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804592/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/discussion-reddit-self-afirming-beliefs_slgdnq.jpg" alt="screenshot of the Reddit discussion"></p>
<p>If someone is asking why to understand a matter, like in this thread, such a response isn't helpful. It is not an explanation; instead, it is a statement of a belief. It is "so" evident (to them) that a proper explanation is not needed anymore.  Others could have demanded a reason, but more remarkable, they kicked off a self-affirmation loop.</p>
<p>It is a behavior that I didn't expect to see in professional-focused discussions, especially not around us developers. I was curious. Is this an exception, or is it a habitual action? I found an overwhelming amount of debates (online and offline) with these recurrent patterns.</p>
<p>But why should we care about it? Why should we care that debates are turning this way?</p>
<p>Why is the presented quota a statement of belief? And why have beliefs an impact on our productivity? One of the text's central argument is that beliefs are a simplification of reality.</p>
<p>They are not inherently bad. The most professional beliefs we have are not something like believing that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-glance-at-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-incendiary-words/2021/02/04/b0748070-6745-11eb-bab8-707f8769d785_story.html#google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.politics_4:%7E:text=SPACE%20LASERS">a secret Jewish space laser silence the advocates for functional programming</a>, and hence, it not a mainstream thing. Our professional beliefs are definitely not as deranged, although the impacts of beliefs in software development are severe too.  On the individual level, the person is missing a learning opportunity and hence facing a productivity loss. That is an argument we examine in this article. However, this personal effect is accelerated by peer dynamic, resulting in teams or even organizational level to a denial of facts. One of the multiple reasons the solar wind hack has been possible was <a href="https://thenewstack.io/solarwinds-the-worlds-biggest-security-failure-and-open-sources-better-answer/#13865249:%7E:text=Ironically%2C%20SolarWinds%20claimed%20open%20source%20software,can%20infect%20it%20with%20malicious%20code">the belief that security through obscurity works and open discussion about security hinders a successful implementation</a>.</p>
<p>It is a long path to understand the effects of beliefs on your productivity, but it's worth it. Being open to new ideas is one of the best ways to have sustainable productivity: once that is stable today and tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Beliefs as a simplification of a complex reality</h2>
<p>Metaphysics is a branch inside the philosophy that developed concepts around reality. As with many other social sciences, there are conflicting points of view, heated debates, and sometimes delicious humor around reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804930/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/meme-tree-falls-in-forest_mftuft.jpg" alt="Meme about a tree is falling in the forest"></p>
<p>That people can live in different realities doesn't only become evident after the US 2020 election but also for people living with others suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Reality is the objective truth of things, in all of its complexity and known and unknown relationships.  Reality doesn't need to be recognized to exist. For instance, the electric current is real (and measurable), whether you choose to plug in your device or not. Deregulating banks and the finance sector to create wealth for everyone is not reality because its sole existence is based on humans' minds choosing to follow this narrative. It wouldn't exist if humans didn't exist.</p>
<p>However, based on our limited sensory and intellectual capacity, we, as humans, can only perceive a fraction of reality at a time. We experience reality, and this experience is subjective. Very often, humans confuse this experience with reality itself.  As mentioned earlier, some mental illnesses prove that point. Patients see things we don't recognize. They hear voices we can't listen to. For them, what they experienced is real.  Thoughts of deep trauma can be experienced as authentic now, even if the occurrence lies years in the past.</p>
<p>Multiple past experiences are combined - sometimes more melted -  into a theory. A theory is an explanation of <em>how reality is</em> in a particular circumstance. Theories are the foundation for <em>judgments</em>. Judgment is the anticipation of a theory coming true. If judgments have been proven "right" enough times, they become a <strong>belief</strong>.</p>
<p>Toddlers are representing excellent examples of incorporating multiple experiences into a theory. Imagine a scenario where various toys have been given to a kid. Let's say green and red ones. The red toys make sounds and the green ones don't. After a couple of tries, their brains combine the experience of reality (red) with another experience of reality (make sounds when shaking) and create the theory that red toys make sounds. After enough tries, they started the judgment that they need to interact with red ones if they want to hear a sound.  If more toys with different colors are added and don't make a sound, the toddler created a belief: Only red toys make a sound.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612804959/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/kids-believes-only-red-toys-make-a-sound_uzoo8n.jpg" alt="After trying different toys, a child creates the belief that red toys make a sound"></p>
<p>With our experience (because we experience many contradicting examples), we can easily see that there is no correlation between the color of a toy and its ability to make a sound. But for them, this belief drives their behavior.</p>
<p>Beliefs are a necessity. Without beliefs, we would be overwhelmed with the infinite complexity of reality. Literally, we couldn't survive a day. Going back to the toddler example and imagine a situation where there are multiple toys, and the toddler wants to hear a sound. Believing (as a result of experience) that red toys make a sound is incredibly beneficial in this circumstance because they can "safely" ignore all other toys.</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs are a simplifications of reality, a model, and not reality itself.</strong></p>
<p>Based on that, we can visualize a reality funnel. Each level is a simplification of the class before.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805033/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/the-belief-funnel_anvasy.jpg" alt="The reality funnel as a filter system to handle the infinity complexity of reality"></p>
<h2>Software development is complex enough so that an individual is unable to know the system entirely</h2>
<p>While the section before talked about reality as the foundation, I want to show that the same mechanism applies to non-natural systems too. Modern software development (maybe starting 20 years back) is so complex that it can't be understood fully. You can't possibly know all the implications of your source code or knowing all the side effects. It is not as complex as reality itself, but in its whole, it is unknowable.  I want to call this a <strong>meta-reality</strong>.</p>
<p>Indeed, most of the time, we experience this meta-reality not using our senses but through a thought based feedback process. It can be a debugger, indicated which control path a program goes. It can be logging at a console or LEDs turning on and off.  My personal best example is creating a layout in HTML with Bootstrap, something I haven't understood fully. Usually, I apply classes to certain elements and hope that they arrange in a way I want them to.</p>
<p>These examples have in common that we create an input (our source code) and experience the result. Based on that experience, we make a theory about how the meta-reality works. Because we can't easily sense this kind of reality, the experience (or should I say beliefs) of other individuals become more vital in the construction of our theories, judgments, and beliefs.</p>
<p>For instance - before we have even experience with classes - we can just by reading, listening, and watching incorporate the theory that classes are beneficial to structure code and separating concerns. The massive amount of different available sources give their theory the needed credibility to evolve into a judgment. It is important to note that this judgment could be created before you write your code for the first time. In the end, the belief that classes are the only way to structure your code is created.</p>
<p>In the meta-reality, beliefs have the same function: Reducing complexity and make choices easier. Instead of thinking about the best approach to structure code, the belief kicks in, and you choose classes within seconds. (This leads to the next belief about finding the perfect name. :wink: )</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/good-input/image/upload/v1612805207/beliefs-and-long-term-productivity/classes-as-the-best-way-to-structure-code_dbs2u7.png" alt="Based on beliefs, classes are the only option to structure source code"></p>
<h2>Once created, a belief can stick for a long time</h2>
<p>Creating a belief is a thought and input-intensive process. Once created, most persons tend to protect their investment and shield their beliefs from contradicting experiences. Either they don't pay attention to new experiences by trying out different ways, or they don't listen to people with conflicting opinions. The situation is worsening, with our human tendency to group with people having the same beliefs. Once we are a member of a group, we protect the group. Regarding beliefs, this tendency can create the self-assuring loops seen in the Reddit thread (and so much more).</p>
<p>Another approach to structure code is functional programming. I'm not advocating for one over the other. You can hardly find people that are doing (and enjoying) both: functional and object-orientated programming. Object orientation is widely mainstream. So programmers feel less concerned in paying attention to non OOP approaches. While functional programmers, a minority, need to stick together even more. So evidence that OOP could be beneficial, at least in some cases, are dropped. In the end, you have to pick a side: Either you doing OOP or functional programming. But isn't that too simple?</p>
<h2>Sticking to beliefs drops long term productivity</h2>
<p>In reality - likewise in meta-reality - change is constant. In reality, though, it is easier to sense it. Hence contradicting experiences can more quickly emerge and lead to a shift in a theory, judgment, and eventually belief.</p>
<p>I'd argue that since (western) nations experience climate change in their daily lives more severely (new experience), it changes the way they experience reality. This alteration leads to hopefully and eventually new beliefs. Using fossil fuels has a severe downside and is not an investment option for the future, which is now a common belief in society.</p>
<p>The sensing in the meta-reality is much, much more complicated. There are incidents so evident that ignoring is practically impossible, like broken builds due to now obsolete calls to APIs. The relationship between cause and effect can easily be spotted, which shortened the feedback loop tremendously. It …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>



<p>In our <a href="https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/releases/tag/v0.30.0">recent version of lakeFS</a>, we switched to base <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit">metadata storage on immutable files stored on S3</a> and other common object stores.&nbsp; Our design is inspired by Git, but for object stores rather than filesystems, and with (much) larger repositories holding machine-generated commits. The design document is informative but by nature omits much of the reasoning behind it.&nbsp; This is (hopefully) the first in a series of posts that dive deeply into the details and rationale behind it.&nbsp; It discusses <em>why</em> the graveler 2-level storage design is useful for the immutable key-value store needed, and <em>how</em> we benchmarked in order to choose its parameters to get good caching of data from S3.&nbsp; Future posts will discuss why we specifically chose the <a href="https://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB SSTable file <em>format</em></a> and its <em>implementation</em> using the <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/">Pebble SSTable library from CockroachDB</a>.</p>



<p>The new design for committed storage, in brief:</p>



<ul><li>A <em>commit</em> combines some commit metadata with a list of all its stored named objects.</li><li>This list is stored in an immutable key-value format termed <em>graveler</em>.</li><li>A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit#bookmark=id.nvxia26m6klf"><em>graveler</em> key-value store</a> is an SSTable mapping keys (lakeFS pathnames) to values (object S3 URLs with some per-object metadata).</li><li>This SSTable is split across multiple S3 objects, each holding a <em>range</em> — an SSTable of contiguous key-value pairs.</li><li>Each range has an ID, and the list of ranges is stored in a <em>metarange</em> — an SSTable of IDs of range, keyed by that last key in each range.</li></ul>



<p>In essence this is a B+Tree of height 2.</p>

<p>We think this is a great top-level design!&nbsp; It…</p>



<ul><li>transfers a successful architecture for solving a similar problem (git) to our domain;</li><li>arranges standard building blocks, such as SSTables and object-store objects, in well-understood patterns;</li><li> uses immutability to allow for reproducibility and concurrency.</li></ul>



<p>But it has many knobs, and it leaves many low-level decisions open.</p>



<h2>Outline of graveler</h2>



<p>We store committed data in <em>graveler</em>.&nbsp; A commit in both Git and lakeFS is a binding of specific versions of the objects (files) in that commit with some additional <em>commit metadata</em> – such as parent commit IDs, commit message, author, user metadata.&nbsp; Actual versions of objects – the “data” – are stored on underlying object storage (typically S3); for our purposes here with an arbitrary path.&nbsp; graveler is our system that maps object paths in a specific revision to the object paths on underlying storage.</p>

<p>This example shows graveler holding 2 revisions.&nbsp; File “a/file” <em>changes</em> between revisions, file “a/nother” is deleted, file “be/good” is renamed to “bat/man”, and file “be/tter” remains unchanged.&nbsp; The object names on underlying storage are immaterial to graveler.&nbsp; Additionally, because lakeFS is a versioned object store, it has no direct concept of “directories”: files are attached to paths.&nbsp; Splitting on separator characters (typically “/”) occurs at a higher level; graveler need merely provide an efficient “seek until &gt;=” operation.</p>



<p>Just as in Git, <em>commits never change</em>.&nbsp; So graveler is an immutable key-value store, that behaves as a large SSTable.&nbsp; However, the design of graveler faces some different forces from that of Git:</p>



<ul><li>graveler must be able to hold many more paths.&nbsp; A repository with merely millions of paths is <em>small</em>.&nbsp;</li><li>graveler uses a remote underlying storage.&nbsp; Remote files are fetched using the tiered filing system described in a previous blog post, “<a href="https://lakefs.io/tiers-in-the-cloud-how-lakefs-caches-immutable-data-on-local-disk/">Tiers in the Cloud: How lakeFS caches immutable data on local-disk</a>”.&nbsp; But access to any object that is not cached locally is <em>slow</em>, and random access is only an option after successfully retrieving the entire object.</li></ul>



<p>This leads to different implementation choices.</p>



<h2>Metadata object sizes</h2>



<p>A lakeFS repository uses the underlying storage for two different tasks:</p>



<ol><li>Storing <em>user</em> data objects.&nbsp; The number and size of these objects is controlled by the user, and an efficient workload already controls these parameters to allow efficient operation on the underlying storage.</li><li>Storing <em>metadata</em> objects.&nbsp; lakeFS controls the number and size of these objects, and must do so efficiently.</li></ol>



<p>lakeFS has multiple typical access patterns to committed data:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fully sequential </strong>(rare): When delivering a full listing of objects, or when computing a diff or merge of very different commits.</li><li><strong>Sequential with random skips</strong>: When listing objects with paths matching a particular prefix, or when computing a diff or merge of rather similar commits.</li><li><strong>Random but local skips</strong>: A typical “big data” application will access particular subsets of paths, and access paths within each subset in roughly lexicographical order.</li><li><strong>Random</strong>: When accessing a single file.</li></ul>



<p>So SSTables are a good fit for committed data in lakeFS, just as it is for unchanging data in many other object stores.&nbsp; Indeed, Git stores its files in tree objects — essentially per-directory SSTables.</p>



<p>Picking “good” object sizes requires benchmarking.  We use the very comprehensive S3 benchmark numbers from <a href="https://github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark">github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark</a>.</p>



<p>Time to download a file from an object store can roughly be modelled as <em>t<sub>initial</sub> + size/bandwidth</em>: a roughly fixed cost to start downloading, followed by time to download all remaining bytes.&nbsp; Here are some of dvassallo’s numbers for times achieved for 10 threads running on c5.4xlarge instances.&nbsp;<em>t<sub>initial</sub></em> is roughly the <em>time to request</em>.</p>

<pre><code><strong>A note on benchmarking S3</strong>
S3 timing is unfortunately not generally repeatable.&nbsp; These numbers represent the <em>lowest latency</em> I could measure over 3 regions (us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-central-1) over a few days.&nbsp; Other measured latencies were around 18-19 msec for 90th percentile of time to request.</code></pre>



<p>In all cases time to request is barely affected by object size&nbsp; At object sizes below 512 KiB it is comparable to the time to receive the entire object.&nbsp; So object sizes below 512 KiB are always less effective for our access patterns: taking into account that they perform more accesses, <em>they require strictly </em><strong><em>more</em></strong><em> time to fetch metadata on any number of files</em>.</p>



<p>Large objects are less effective for all access patterns that access only parts of the repository, they potentially fetch more data than needed.&nbsp; At the same time, graveler design allows us to <em>re-use shared objects</em> between SSTables for different commits.&nbsp; In order to do this we need those objects to be shared; this is easier to do with smaller objects: An object needs to be rewritten whenever it changes.&nbsp; So splitting an SSTable between more objects makes each object more re-usable.</p>



<p>In light of this, we designed graveler to use object sizes of 1-10 MiB.</p>



<h2>Lightweight B+Trees</h2>



<p>A repository can contain hundreds of millions of objects at a single commit.&nbsp; Git overloads the directory structure of the files in the repository in order to determine <em>tree objects</em>.&nbsp; Each tree object holds a single directory, linking to additional tree objects for subdirectories.</p>



<p>lakeFS data repositories are somewhat different from Git source code repositories.&nbsp; Firstly, they tend to have orders of magnitude <em>more</em> objects – even billions of objects.&nbsp; But performance of directory scans is much <em>less</em> important in data lakes than performance of sequential scans, and directory structures can be very deep (8 or more levels are common).&nbsp; This allows us to separate concerns differently.</p>



<p>Graveler stores a sorted list of key-value pairs in multiple consecutive files.&nbsp; “Leaf” files are termed <em>ranges</em>.&nbsp; These hold the actual values: path to object on underlying object store and additional per-object metadata.&nbsp; We try to keep leaf files to have sizes in the range on 1-10 MiB.&nbsp; The different ranges hold non-overlapping ranges of keys.&nbsp; The list of references to range objects is stored in a separate file termed a <em>metarange</em>.&nbsp; It holds the range files in order of their keys, indexed by last key.</p>



<p>So the graveler SSTable is stored pretty much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+Tree</a> with 2 levels: a root (metarange) and leaf nodes (ranges).&nbsp; Internal nodes are identified by digests of their contents, making this a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree"><em>Merkle tree</em></a>.&nbsp; Nodes with the same contents receive identical identifiers, allowing for re-using nodes between similar trees as well as constant-time comparisons.</p>



<h3>Only 2 levels?</h3>



<p>We <em>do not currently limit the size of metarange files</em>.&nbsp; A typical object entry is &lt;512 bytes, so a 10 MiB range file can hold 20K object entries.&nbsp; Given that we have more control over names of range file objects, a 10 MiB metarange file can hold rather more than 20K object entries, for a total of 400M object entries.<br>What happens if the metarange file is too large?&nbsp; We just keep it large.&nbsp; It turns out that we do not lose much!&nbsp; Almost all of the nodes in any B+Tree are near the leaves.&nbsp; The massive branching-factor of our nodes means that we would add at most 1 level if we split the metarange file: even splitting the root into just 100 entries would give a graveler file capable of holding 40G object entries.&nbsp; The gains from adding intermediate nodes are not much: a minimal increase in caching and dedupe efficiency (almost all of the cache and dedupe are for ranges, not metaranges), in exchange for <em>no</em> reduction in latency (all accesses would now require 3 steps rather than 2 as before).</p>



<pre><code><strong>A note about Git packfiles
</strong>As mentioned above, Git holds many more tree objects per file than we hold range objects.&nbsp; It reduces the number of files that it needs to access by collecting small objects into “pack files”.&nbsp; This significantly reduces the total size of repository metadata, and allows it to regain much of …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

    <p>Semantic Versioning is better than most Versioning systems today, but because it means different things to different people, it remains more of a Social Versioning system than a semantic one.</p>
<p>I propose a new Versioning Scheme named Mark Versioning, which aims to separate and preserve both social and semantic aspects of versioning.</p>
<p>A <em>Mark</em> is a specific version of a software. This number is decided by social consensus, and represents major iterations / changes to a software. It starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 whenever appropriate.</p>
<p>A <em>Revision</em> is similar to a Mark, but it represents a strict change in API. This may be a breaking or a no breaking change. Reversions start at 0 for each mark, and are incremented by one whenever an API change is detected. This should be done automatically by package management software.</p>
<p>A <em>Hash</em> is the particular SHA-3 hash (in hex form, truncated to 8 characters) of a the source code of a software version. A Revision may have multiple different hashes. Alternatively, one can start from 0 with each Revision and automatically increment by 1 with each change. This should be done automatically.</p>
<p>Mark Versioning can be written out in two forms: long and short.</p>
<p>Long form: </p>
<pre><code>Mark &lt;X&gt; Revision &lt;Y&gt; Hash &lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Short form:</p>
<pre><code>m&lt;X&gt;r&lt;Y&gt;#&lt;zzzzzzzz&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>Mark 3 Revision 16 Hash ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Same in short form:</p>
<pre><code>m3r16#ae473ff6
</code></pre>
<p>Optionally, one can leave off Hash or Hash and Revision (if Hash is present, Revision must be present):</p>
<pre><code>Mark 0
Mark 0 Revision 0
Mark 0 Revision 0 Hash 0

m0
m0r0
m0r0#0
</code></pre>
<p>That's all.</p>

<p><span>We know exactly when the Viking Age
began in England – it was more than 1,200 years ago – on June 8, 793. That was
the day when invading Norsemen destroyed the Abbey church on the island of
Lindisfarne, off the north-east coast of England. Lindisfarne was a centre of
learning famous across the continent – but that meant nothing to these fierce
invaders.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings arrived in England in 793 AD</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>Monks were either killed in the abbey,
thrown into the sea to drown or carried away as slaves – along with the church’s
treasures. The devastation of Northumbria’s Holy Island shocked Europe. “Never
before has such an atrocity been seen”, declared the Northumbrian scholar,
Alcuin of York. The Vikings had announced themselves in a devastating way. This
was just a warning of what was to come.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the next 300 years, more and more
invaders would flood into England, and Leicestershire would be full of Vikings.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Divided country</span></b></p>
<p><span>At the
time, England was not one united country – it was divided up into Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms.</span><b> </b><span>Leicester was
included within Mercia, and was known as Legreceastre. It was the principal
city in that kingdom. Even a thousand years ago and more, Legreceastre was a
bit of a melting pot.</span><b> </b><span>It
was a meeting point of several different cultures – the Angles from the Wash
and the Humber, Saxons from Warwickshire, Mercians from the Trent, and Celts
from the hills of Charnwood. In Leicester, they met, traded and eventually
settled.</span><b> </b><span>What increasingly
united these peoples was Christianity.</span><b>
</b><span>Mercia was Christian – the “new” religion reached Leicester in the
year 658. A church was said to have stood from the 7th century on the current
St Margaret’s site.</span><b> </b><span>Leicestershire,
as we know it, was in the heart of the Mercian kingdom and is thought to have
been the capital for political and ecclesiastical affairs. It was far enough
away from the frontiers to avoid changing hands as the unstable boundaries of
the mini-kingdom advanced and receded.</span><b>
</b><span>But what the Anglo-Saxons had worked so hard to build in
Leicestershire, was about to come to an end. The Scandinavian enemy was at the
gates and Mercia would never be the same again.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Ruthlessly pillaged</span></b></p>
<p><span>In 10 short years, between 865 and 874,
the whole structure of life in Mercia collapsed. A huge Scandinavian army
marched and pillaged up and down England. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has
preserved a glimpse of these years of chaos in its records of “a great heathen
army” that pillaged East Anglia in the year 865. Between 865 and 868 the
Northmen widened their field for plunder and tribute to East Mercia. Leicester
was attacked in 868, partly destroying the ancient Roman city walls.</span></p>

<p><span>Thousands of Danes swarmed down the
River Soar in their small, easily-managed boats, penetrating the very heart of
the country, carrying fire and sword among the simple and terrified population,
whom they ruthlessly pillaged and massacred. In the winter of 874 to 5, after
defeating Burhed, King of Mercia in battle, the raiders established their
quarters at Repton on the River Trent. Monasteries, the repositories of rich
and beautiful objects in gold, silver and jewellery, formed particular targets
for the pagan invaders. The monastery that had been founded at Breedon in
Leicestershire was reputedly sacked. But these Danes didn’t just hit and run,
like the early invaders on Lindisfarne.</span></p>

<tr><td>The Vikings swarmed down the River Soar</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><span>In its records of the year 877, the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests a permanent settlement of the land. The Danish
army it says “went into the land of the Mercians, and shared out some of it,
and gave some to Ceolwulf”. Ceolwulf was the puppet king whom the Danes placed
on the Mercian throne. It seems Mercia was now divided in half.</span></p>

<p><span>Large parts of its eastern territories
had passed into the hands of the Scandinavian invaders and were open to
settlement. Within the next decade, in 886, the losses of Anglo-Saxon territory
in Mercia were clearly defined by a treaty that King Alfred the Great concluded
with Guthrum, the leader of the Danes, after his Wessex Saxons had recaptured
London.</span></p>

<p><span>A permanent “country of Danes” was now
established within England, known as the Danelaw. This Danish part of England
comprised the greater part of eastern England from East Anglia to North
Yorkshire, incorporating most of Leicestershire. You could say that Leicester
was part of Denmark.</span></p>

<p><span>Leicestershire was close to the Danelaw
boundary though, and it is believed that some of the wealthier inhabitants
migrated with as many possessions as they could carry. As the churches were
destroyed and Christian rites trampled, the Bishop of Leicester retired to
safety at Dorchester-on-Thames. It would be more than a thousand years before
there would again be a Diocese of Leicester. Leicester, with Derby, Nottingham,
Lincoln and Stamford, became one of the “Five Boroughs” of the Danelaw. Leicester,
as a former Anglo-Saxon royal city, continued its importance under Danish rule.
Danish forms of taxation and local government took root in Leicester.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Danish Leicester</span></b></p>
<p><span>Although the Danelaw’s existence was
relatively short-lived, it left an everlasting mark on the history of
Leicestershire. The Scandinavians left an indelible impression on the language
of the East Midlands. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Vocabulary,
grammatical structures and the very tones of local dialect were deeply affected
by the contact with Scandinavia. Despite this, there aren’t many archeological
finds to be seen; visible remains of the Norsemen are hard to come by. Leicestershire’s
archaeological record lacks burials, pottery and everyday implements.</span></p>

<p><span>Finds that we do have are generally
personal ornaments such as brooches, horse accessories, coinage and weaponry. There
are also some distinctly Irish objects found in Leicestershire that were
probably plundered by Vikings during raids, and transported back to the Danelaw
lands. Such finds include a “shrine mount” from Breedon and belt buckles from
Melton.</span></p>

<p><span>Our understanding of Danish settlement
and the geography of the Danelaw depends largely on the evidence of
Scandinavian place-names. The place-name ending of by, which means a farm or
more usually a settlement, is seen throughout Denmark. That same ending is
common in England too. In Leicestershire alone, 56 villages end in by (such as Oadby)
and of these, half the number contain a Danish personal name as their other
element. But towards Leicester, on the broad gravel spreads where the River
Wreake empties into the Soar, the character of place-names changes. The sounds
of the Scandinavian invaders gives way to names of an older Mercian origin with
names ending in -ton. Thrussington, Syston and Cossington all speak of an
earlier period in Leicestershire’s settlement history. Even though the ton
element suggests the presence of a settlement that survived the impact of the
Danish army, the first element in these names is frequently a Scandinavian
personal name. Many Leicestershire villages were named after powerful Danes.
Ingarsby is named after the Danish Prince Ingar and it is now believed that
Humberstone may be named after Ingar’s brother, Hubba. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Both Princes entered Leicester during the
Danish invasion and could have settled in the villages named after themselves.</span></p>

<p><span>But as well as being named after actual

Thurlaston and Thurnby all owe their name to one of the principal pagan gods of
the Scandinavian culture – Thor, who together with Odin, were the most commonly
worshipped gods. An archaeological find from Leicestershire of a miniature
“Thor’s Hammer”, the god’s famous magical weapon, is on display in the Jewry
Wall Museum.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Names are clues</span></b></p>
<p><span>With invading forces, you may assume
that they would settle on the broad and fertile river terraces of the Soar. But
settlements already existed here and new areas of land were needed to house the
large band of men who came to dwell in Leicestershire. By the study of
place-names, it appears that they turned towards the emptier and perhaps less
rewarding river terraces that flank the narrow valley of the Wreake. Along that
river we find Frisby, Hoby, Rotherby, Brooksby and Rearsby. The word “Wreake”
is also derived from Scandinavia, being the Old Norse word for “twisted”. So,
Wreake is both a description and the new name for the river once known as the
River Eye. Historian Sir Frank Stenton said the Wreake settlement was occupied
by a large body of the Danish army who took permanent occupation of the land
some time around 877.</span></p>

<p><span>The army would have been stationed here
so it could spring to the defence of Leicester if the town was ever threatened
by invaders from the west. Another Danish encampment is thought to have stood
on the area of Leicester known as Dane Hills. The creation of the Danelaw made
as great an impression on Leicester as in the surrounding countryside. The
colonising Danes, soldiers and farmers, turned the Mercian cathedral city into
a garrison town. The term “gate,” descended from the Old Norse, “gata,” meaning
a street, occurs in a handful of streets in the heart of Leicester. All in the
same part of town we find Gallowtree Gate, Humberstone Gate, Church Gate,
Belgrave Gate and Sanvey Gate. They lie outside the line of the former Roman
and medieval wall, beyond the bounds of the Anglo-Saxon town. As we all know,
the first four streets converge at the Clock Tower where High Street passed
through the former East Gate out of the walled enclosure of the medieval town. Thus,
the presence of the “gata” element in modern street names of Leicester suggests
that the Danes, when they made Leicester one of their strongholds, established
a new town outside the wall of the Mercian city. By the early years of the 10th
century, Leicester may have been like a town of two halves, sharply divided
into Anglo-Saxon and Danish quarters.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was reading the Slate Star Codex <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-the-cult-of-smart">review</a> of The Cult of Smart. Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I donâ€™t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p>
<p>I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 âˆ’ 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also werenâ€™t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. Itâ€™s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. Itâ€™s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p>
<p>There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldnâ€™t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldnâ€™t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didnâ€™t realize anything unusual was happening.</p>
<p>Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. Theyâ€™re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p>
<ul><li><p>The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldnâ€™t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p></li><li><p>All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p></li><li><p>Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.
Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isnâ€™t surprising. If teachersâ€™ promotions and managementâ€™s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But itâ€™s still sad.</p></li></ul>
<p>Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/â€‹expels a student, thereâ€™s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, donâ€™t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p>
<p>I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasnâ€™t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. Heâ€™s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were â€œI learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazingâ€�. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/â€‹upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friendsâ€™ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what Iâ€™ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m unsure what my point here is. I think I have two:</p>
<ul><li><p>Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasnâ€™t also the case in the US.</p></li><li><p>I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. Itâ€™s just good to remember that itâ€™s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p></li></ul>

        <h4>20 Feb 2021</h4>
        <p><a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Tools/">Tools</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/Rant/">Rant</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://tevps.net/blog/DevOps/">DevOps</a></p><p>
        TL;DR: Proposal for a way to define multiple-machine systems in a immutable way, without requiring by-hand layouts.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading a lot about <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops#nixops">NixOps</a> recently, and although I’m still leaning towards <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> overall as my system configurator of choice (technically <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>, but that’s not so relevant for this), I’ve realised there’s a gap in the market for better immutable infrastructure. Note that this is a half-formed proposal, not a plan to do things, as I’ve already got way too many things on my plate, but I felt it was worth sharing the idea with others if anyone feels like picking this up, or doing something derived from it.</p>
<p>The goal is as follows: I want to be able to declare things like “I want X replicas of this service running, on different nodes” and “don’t put too many things on one node so the load gets well shared”, while not having to layout by hand <em>which</em> nodes the services go on, as they’re <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/">cattle not pets</a>. We can do this with Kubernetes right now, but at the cost of a system that tends towards being hard to debug when things go wrong, and things can <a href="https://k8s.af/">go very wrong</a>. It also has the limit that you have to containerise everything and isn’t really suited to managing local node setups (i.e. everything you need installed before you run the Kubernetes agent, like say ntp).</p>
<p>Nix OTOH, is absolutely designed for the local node setup, and NixOps would let us then setup multiple machines. However, NixOps is designed towards a “here’s a set of Nix expressions defining a series of specific machines”, and isn’t designed for any of the “choose where stuff goes for me” bits. These machines aren’t full-blown pets as they’re still automatically configured, but they’re not really fully cattle either.</p>
<p>We need a 3rd option: something with the best bits of both. Maybe it can be done with a variant of NixOps that defines a “basic node” config (stuff you want everywhere, like a specific kernel, ntp, maybe some firewall stuff), and then a series of “service” configs, that probably contain <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243920">an actual service config</a> and maybe any other packages/config that service needs, along with some metadata (e.g. replication count, memory/CPU requirements). It does need some sort of thing that decides “where does that particular service go” especially if the node that was carrying it goes down. Maybe we have some little service running on each node with <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus</a> to decide what goes where, but all compiling down to Nix configurations for ease of debugging. It would also need to be able to cope with the upgrade case, plausibly by using the consensus system to replace a subset at a time of the services (or maybe some magic with unique names for services so we can run old version + new version at the same time)</p>
<p>Ideally, we also have something that lets us say spit out <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> config for the more infrastructure things (NixOps supports AWS, Hetzner and GCE; Terraform supports <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers">basically everything</a> and so it’s just easier that way), and then we can have a single config language that defines everything about our system’s setup other than the source code. And without needing to write <a href="https://octopus.com/blog/introduction-to-hcl-and-hcl-tooling">HCL</a>!</p>
<p>I would also note that I don’t regard Nix as the definitive option on system config languages. I think the immutable infrastructure approach is great, but the Nix language <a href="https://davedellacosta.com/posts/2019-03-29-why-nixos-is-hard-and-how-to-fix.html#what-is-so-hard">is kinda awful</a>. I’m somewhat more fond of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">Guix</a>, but I’ve used Nix here as the example as it’s the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/800-pound_gorilla">800-pound gorilla</a> in this space currently. I’m not sure what “better” looks like, other than liking the approach of using an existing language (as Guix does with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile Scheme</a>) rather than building half of one along the way like Nix does.</p>
<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

        <h2>Our API</h2>
        <p>
          You are visiting the front-end for the <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>doc online software. In the backend, it is running a RESTful API that provides a few endpoints for you to use. Please make sure you read the following instructions about what to expect and what not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these requests will return either HTTP status code 200 (OK) or, in the case of any error, HTTP status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity). The <code>/version</code>endpoint is guaranteed not to fail.

        <h2>Deploying your own instance</h2>
        <h3>Running an executable JAR file</h3>
        <p>
          <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>doc online is an open-source product available at its <a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online">GitLab repository page</a>. It consists of one server component that does host the API and the front-end at the same time. If you simply want to have these features available to you, download the latest build artifacts from there (i.e. the JAR file with dependencies) and run it with your local Java installation. Please note that the software requires a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> distribution installed and internet connection for fetching the topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          When running the JAR file, a local webserver will start up and host the service at <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code>which is configurable through the command-line switches. Calling this address will open up the web interface. Appending API paths will execute the API calls and return the JSON objects. To stop the server from running, simply <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>the Java process.
        </p>
        <h3>Booting up a container</h3>
        <p>
          Alternatively, the preferred way to host your own instance should be running our Docker container (a list of available tags may be found<a href="https://gitlab.com/islandoftex/images/texdoc-online/container_registry">at GitLab</a>). The Docker container runs the web service as its entrypoint so running the server will start up the web server . Because the Docker container is built on top of our <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live images, it does not require a local <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> installation which might be beneficial for web servers. Internet connection is required,though. This all comes at the cost of being quite a big docker image of some gigabytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your Docker container runs for multiple days, it features an automated update of <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>Live. Every day at 00:01 in the morning, a full update of the distribution is performed updating to the latest and greatest package versions <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span> Live has to offer. Please note, that updates between distribution releases will not be performed that way; in order to upgrade from TL&amp;nbsp;2020 to TL&amp;nbsp;2021 you would need to pull the latest Docker image again but that means that the need for re-pulling the Docker image reduces to once per year.

<p>We are probably all familiar with "555" telephone numbers. The basic idea is
that the 555 exchange code (or NXX in a NANP NXX-XXXX number) is reserved for
use in fiction. Of course, this isn't actually true at all, but that hasn't
stopped basically every work of fiction putting their imaginary telephone
numbers in the 555 exchange.</p>
<p>In reality, the 555 exchange has a somewhat bumpy history, as is the case with
most "special purpose" telephone ranges. Seemingly from the genesis of NANP as
a formal numbering standard, the 555 exchange was reserved for special use by
telcos, and was not to be used for normal subscriber lines. The 555 exchange
accumulated various and sundry uses, but most prominently, starting in the
early '60s it was used for directory service at 555-1212 in nearly all NPAs
(area codes). This was nearly the only successful use of the 555 exchange,
leaving it mostly empty.</p>
<p>Because the 555 exchange was conveniently largely out of use, it became common
for the entertainment industry to use 555 numbers in fiction. Wikipedia makes
the claim that the telephone industry had specifically recommended 555 numbers
for this use in the '60s, and while this is rather thinly sourced, it's not
hard to believe as any odd person in a technical role at a telephone company
might have suggested 555 as an exchange with extremely few assigned numbers.</p>
<p>In any case, the use of 555 numbers for fiction was somewhat informal. This
changed in 1994, when the telephone industry regretted leaving an entire
exchange out of use and formed a working group which allowed 555 numbers to
be assigned to nationwide communications services. The idea was that 555
numbers would have the unusual property of working nationwide when dialed as
only seven digits, somewhat like an early version of SMS short codes.</p>
<p>Because the use of 555 numbers in fiction was longstanding, the working group
explicitly reserved numbers starting 555-01 for use in fiction. This, in 1994,
is when this practice became formalized---but only for those 100 numbers.</p>
<p>In practice the 555 service as imagined was unsuccessful, and in the 2010s the
use was eliminated more or less by handshake agreement. Much like the pre-1994
state, the only valid phone numbers in the 555 exchange are 555-1212 for
directory assistance, and 555-4334. This latter number is apparently still
assigned for a nationwide use but no one specifies <em>what</em> use.</p>
<p>I did a bit of digging, and... came up empty. 555-4334 in a number of area
codes turns up nothing from the CNAM service I use. Similar attempts with
a couple of validation/carrier lookup vendors returned different types of
useless results. I haven't found any mention of the number in old newspapers,
with the interesting exception of some newspapers listing their classified
ads with exclusively 555 numbers, including 4334.</p>
<p>It was not an unusual practice at the time for newspapers to provide special
"voice mail box" numbers for classified ads, but to my knowledge the use of 555
was not typical.  The first newspapers to do so were almost all in Utah, which
hints that it may have originated as a choice by a local telco, potentially
Mountain Bell but maybe more likely an independent. I will do some more digging
into this over time. It's interesting in that it suggests a major use of 555
numbers which no document I've seen on the history of the exchange mentions.
This practice doesn't seem to have been eliminated until the 1994 reallocation.</p>
<p>I also learned that in 2009 you could get a rebate of $7,555 or $4,334 on a new
Dodge Nitro. Isn't OCR fun?</p>
<p>Finally, I located an older FCC report (dated 1997) that lists 555-4334 as
allocated to MCI mail, an early e-mail service. MCI mail access was initially
by modem, and so it's possible that 555-4334 was used as an access number,
although an 800 number was also provided for this purpose and 4334 is not
mentioned anywhere I can find as an access number. An interesting feature of
MCI Mail was its ability to forwarded email to postal addresses (by printing and
mailing it) or by fax or teletype, so I speculate that 555-4334 may have been
used as a return number for TTY messages, since the TTY integration was
apparently bidirectional. In any case, another document noted that 555-4334 was
permitted to remain in service until that service ended, which may have been an
allowance due to the fact that MCI was a telephone carrier (and thus had
greater sway over the working group) and that replacing the number may have
been technically difficult.</p>
<p>Today, it remains the case that only 555-01xx is properly allocated for
fictional use. However, the 555 exchange as a whole is as dead (or considering
the use by newspapers, much  more dead) than ever before, so it remains common
to use the entire 555 exchange in fiction.</p>
<p>Oddly, the 555 NPA (rather than exchange) is allocated for similar
applications, but as far as I can tell it is not in use.</p>
<p>The failure of the post-1994 use of 555 for a "short dialing service" reflects
a larger series of telco failures that has left some other special prefixes.
In the '90s, a great deal of attention was directed towards "non-geographic"
dialing. Because the telephone system connected the nation together, why not
have a method of telephone dialing which is independent of geography? Well, as
it turns out, there are several reasons, but this didn't stop anyone from
trying.</p>
<p>Although there were a hodgepodge of other attempts, the first major
non-geographic dialing scheme is contained in the special 700 NPA (area code).
This NPA was allocated as a direct result of the breakup of the Bell system for
use directly by interexchange (long-distance) carriers, since all existing
numbering ranges were allocated to the exchange (local) carriers. The primary
service offered in this range was "EasyReach 700" from AT&amp;T, which was
basically carrier-managed "follow-me."</p>
<p>Follow-me is a common feature of business telephone systems that allows a call
to a given number (extension or DID) to be directed to one or more real
extensions depending on the location of the intended recipient. For example, a
call to a professional might go to their desk or to an assistant depending on
whether they are in the office, while an auto mechanic might have a call to a
general contact number ring at the front desk or in the shop depending on where
they are.</p>
<p>EasyReach 700 moved this same concept from the PABX to the telephone network,
making it possible for follow-me to span the nation and making it accessible to
businesses without an (expensive) PABX. For example, a consumer with two
different homes could get a 700 number and set it to forward to whichever house
they were staying in, while a traveling salesman could set their 700 number
to forward to whichever hotel they were staying in.</p>
<p>EasyReach was a failure. There were several reasons, but the most significant
relates to the billing climate of the time. Today, unlimited long-distance is
so ubiquitous that the issue may not be obvious, or you might naively assume
that AT&amp;T had found a way to resolve the long distance cost issue. They did
not---in fact, they came up with something worse. The owner of a 700 number
could set it up to either bill forward (to the caller) or reverse (to the
callee). This meant that the caller of a 700 number had virtually no way to
determine whether the call would be free or charged at long-distance rate, and
this was a huge deterrent to use of these numbers.</p>
<p>Today, this and other uses of the 700 NPA have all died out, leaving 700
a nearly empty NPA. Like other empty NPAs, 700 is sometimes hijacked for
special uses by non-mainstream carriers and corporate phone systems. If my
hazy memory is correct, the 700 NPA was used by GE's interoffice leased-line
long distance network when I briefly worked for a GE business. Wikipedia
says that WalMart still uses it this way.</p>
<p>Since the 700 NPA was such a success, AT&amp;T naturally decided to do it again.
In 1993, NANP allocated the 500 NPA to Personal Communications Service (PCS),
not to be confused with Personal Communications Service (PCS). In fact, the
same term was allocated to two completely different purposes by two different
telecom organizations within a few years. The latter refers to a set of
services offered by a wireless network, e.g. Sprint PCS, while the former
refers to...  EasyReach 700 all over again, except for now it's called True
Connections.</p>
<p>True Connections failed for the exact same reasons as EasyReach 700, and was
officially eliminated in 2000, but by this point AT&amp;T had already largely
replaced it with a service using 800 numbers which were of course always
reverse billed...  which you and I might think is obviously what they should
have done in the first place, but back in the '90s toll-free and non-geographic
were viewed as being different animals. It seems to have taken AT&amp;T a long time
to catch on to the fact that the realities of long-distance billing required
that they be closely linked.</p>
<p>The concept of PCS (the non-geographic dialing one) did not die out with True
Connections, and additional NPAs were allocated to the same purpose,
generally in the format of 5 followed by the same digit twice, much like 800.
500 numbers continue to be non-geographic and the billing situation remains
odd, but that hasn't stopped the use of 500 for certain uses like modem banks
for ISPs and some calling cards. Very few 500 numbers remain in use today
despite the multiple allocated 500 codes, and due to the billing issues it's
common for outbound calls to 500 numbers to be blocked. Similar to 700, it's
not unusual for 500 to be used for internal purposes, although this is probably
less of a good idea since PCS services in the 500 NPA have not officially been
ended.</p>
<p>500 and related PCS area codes (500 has a surprising number of overlays
considering how obscure its usage is) also see use for other miscellaneous
telco applications. For example, the 588 area code, also assigned to PCS, was
(and may still be) …</p></article></div>

It’s designed to bring skilled professionals into Taiwan, and if you’ve made more than ~$67k USD/year<label for="sn-1"></label><span>All of the prices are denominated in the law in New Taiwan Dollars, and have been converted into USD at October 2020 rates for this post. The threshold for eligibility is that you make more than $160,000 NTD/month.</span> at any point in the past three years you’re trivially eligible.<label for="sn-2"></label><span>There are also trickier ways to apply, such as proving your expertise in one of the eligible fields: Science and Technology, Economy, Education, Culture and Arts, Sports, Finance, Law, or Architecture. However, the bar for proving expertise is quite high (probably similar to an O-1 visa in the United States, depending on the category).</span> There is no lottery, anyone who is eligible can get approved within a couple months. If you’ve met the income requirement, it’s currently one of the easiest ways to get to Taiwan, and the visa it provides you allows you to enter Taiwan regardless of the COVID-19 situation in your country of origin. This post will explain the process for getting a Gold Card, including several tips that aren’t written down in any official documentation.</p><p>The most important tip is this: if you’re applying via your income, you should apply in the “Economy” category, <em>even if you think a different category describes your work better</em>. The other categories (especially Science and Technology) look for proof of income <strong>and</strong> proof of expertise, despite the law stating that only one is necessary. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, unlike the Ministry of Science and Technology, does things by the books and will approve you solely for the income requirement even if you are not an economist.<label for="sn-3"></label><span>As of February 2021, this may be changing — the Ministry of Economic Affairs appears to be rejecting people who work in fields not related to economics. The Ministry of Science and Technology says that they are now accepting people who work at any company related to science/technology and meet the salary requirement, but it’s too early to tell how strict they are about this.</span> Applying via income in a category other than “Economy” may cause your application to be rejected, and will likely incur a delay in processing your Gold Card request.<label for="sn-4"></label><span>If you’ve already applied in a category other than Economy, you have two options: You can either cancel your current application and submit a new one, paying the application fee a second time, or you can wait the month or two until your application is seen by the relevant ministry, and if it is rejected, change categories then by calling <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">Mr.&nbsp;Huang</a> and explaining the situation (which will not incur the extra fee).</span></p><p>In order to apply, you’ll need a picture of your passport with at least 6 months remaining on it before expiration, a copy of your W-2 or other document that shows your income<label for="sn-5"></label><span>Note that your paystubs are not a valid form of proof. If you don’t have a W-2 or similar tax document showing your full income (for instance, if you were only employed for part of the year), you may be able to get by with a document from your work stating what your income is, but I haven’t heard from anyone who’s done this. The guidelines specify a “月薪” which is translated as “monthly salary” — but this does not necessarily match the legal definition of salary as used in the US, which implies an employment relationship and a W-2. Things that are “月薪”: definitely W-2, possibly 1099-MISC. Things that are not 月薪: income reported on 1099-K, such as taking payment through card networks or being an Uber driver.</span>, a passport-style photo of yourself (a selfie taken in front of a white wall is fine), and a credit card or other method of payment to pay the couple hundred USD application fee.<label for="sn-6"></label><span>The application fees vary from ~$108 - $323 USD ($3,100 - $9,260 NTD) depending on your nationality, the duration of your Gold Card, and whether you apply from inside Taiwan or not. You can find how much the fee is for you in <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">this FAQ</a>. I paid $282 USD as an American applying for a 3-year Gold Card from outside of Taiwan.</span> Once you’ve got all that together, go to the <a href="https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/four-in-one/entry/golden-card">application website</a>, click “I want to apply”, then “Self application”, and create an account. Then start a new Gold Card application and fill out the form. It’ll ask for your address in Taiwan, you can leave it blank if you don’t know where you’ll be staying (which you probably don’t, yet).<label for="sn-7"></label><span>Once you do have an address in Taiwan, you should go to the <abbr title="National Immigration Agency">NIA</abbr> within 30 days to get a new copy of your Gold Card with the address on it.</span> It’ll also ask if you want to apply in Taiwan or at a consulate/embassy overseas - you should probably pick whatever consulate you’re closest to, I went with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco. You will also need to pick how long you want the card to be valid for, from 1-3 years. There is very little downside to picking a longer duration — it costs a trivial amount more, and is no harder to get.<label for="sn-8"></label><span>A possible reason to pick 2 years is if you want to reapply for a 3-year gold card in 2 years, using your current year’s salary — if, for instance, you expect to not be making enough for the salary cutoff once you move to Taiwan. I have no idea if this actually works (the Gold Card program is fairly new, so there aren’t many stories of people reapplying), but it’s worth considering, especially seeing as it could get you enough time to be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5475/5478/141465/141808/152932/">APRC</a>.</span></p><p>Once you’ve submitted your application, you’ll need to wait a few weeks for it to be processed — it took mine 25 days, and I think anywhere from 3 weeks to a month is pretty normal. Either you’ll get a message asking you to provide additional documentation (unlikely, if you’re using a W-2 and submitted everything correctly), or you’ll get an email asking you to submit your passport to the application location that you’ve selected.</p><p>Once you get to the passport submission stage, it can be a bit unclear what to do — you can’t visit in person in most places due to COVID-19<label for="sn-9"></label><span>in the United States, at least.</span>, and the SF TECO at least does not answer phone calls or emails<label for="sn-10"></label><span>While the main SF TECO phone number goes unanswered, if you have Gold Card questions, you can call Angela at (415) 364-5632 and she should be able to help. The line is often busy, but if you leave a message she’ll get back to you.</span> (although other TECOs may be better, you should at least try calling your local TECO). What you need to do is pretty simple, however: just mail in the passport submission notice PDF that you can download on the application website (Download → Download Passport Submission Notice), your passport or a notarized copy of your passport, and a self-addressed USPS priority mail return envelope.</p><p>If like me, you don’t want to send in your physical passport, getting a notarized copy is pretty easy.<label for="sn-11"></label><span>In California, at least — laws vary by state, make sure to check your local laws.</span> Make a document with a copy of your passport<label for="sn-12"></label><span>I used a photo that I scaled so the passport was 1:1 with real life when printed, since I don’t have a scanner.</span> (just the first page and signature is fine, no need to include the stamp pages) and the statement “I, &lt;my name&gt;, affirm that the attached is a true and complete copy of the document which it purports to represent.” Then take that document to a notary and have them notarize your signature on it.</p><p>Once the TECO receives your envelope with the passport, you should get an email saying you’re approved, and only waiting on getting the physical Gold Card in the mail. If you need to fly to Taiwan before it arrives, you can print out a form that will allow you to board the plane on the application website, under “Download → Download Resident Authorization.” If you do this, you’ll need to pay a ~$18 USD ($500 NTD) fee to replace the card once you get to Taiwan. About 21 days after you get the email saying you’re approved<label for="sn-13"></label><span>I was told it would be at most 21 days, but it took 25 for me.</span> you should get a call from the TECO asking to schedule an appointment for you to pick up your Gold Card.<label for="sn-14"></label><span>They may say that this is an “interview,” but you’ve already been approved, so you shouldn’t worry too much about that. They asked me what I do for work, what connections I have in Taiwan, when I planned to go, and where I planned to stay.</span></p><p>Note that the start date (and thus the end date) of your Gold Card is determined by the day the passport is approved, so you may want to be a little strategic if you apply for a Gold Card significantly before you want to go to Taiwan — you can get all the way to the passport submission stage, then wait until a month or so before you plan to leave to actually submit your passport. Obviously there’s a tradeoff here — there’s some risk that your passport won’t be processed in time, but it may be worth considering, depending on your situation.</p><p>If you have any problems during this process, you can find a person to call for assistance on <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=D927ED39BDAE7478&amp;s=DA2F7BC919B77E24">this contact page</a>. Dialing Taiwan phone numbers from the United States can be tricky, but the thing that worked for me was dialing +886, then the area code with the leading zero omitted, then the rest of the number. Dialing 011 before the number or leaving on the zero in the area code would cause the call to fail for me, but your carrier may be different.</p><p>You might also want to check out the <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n=6501F7D3D7CCA8A0">official website</a>, <a href="https://foreigntalentact.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=AC68F9FBABA3F294&amp;s=4D07D9F9F687B542">official FAQ</a>, <a href="https://tw.forumosa.com/t/employment-gold-card-for-some-foreigners/159653">thread on the forumosa forum</a>, the <a href="https://taiwangoldcard.com/application-faq/">unofficial FAQ</a>, or <a href="http://blog.tomfifield.net/2018/05/how-to-apply-for-taiwans-immigration.html">Tom Fifield’s blog post</a>.</p><p>Enjoy Taiwan!</p><p><i>Thanks to Brandon Liu for providing additional information about valid sources of income.</i></p></section><section><p><a href="https://notebook.wesleyac.com/">☙</a></p></section></article></div>]]>

	<p><small>February 20, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>Over on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363196953065099265">I had a hot take</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hot take: Every distribution packager who's saying "you shouldn't
bundle dependencies" is implicitly telling software authors "you
should do more work for us and limit the features (and reliability) of
your software".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This was sparked by reading <a href="https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/">The modern packagerâ€™s security
nightmare</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zb1c4k/modern_packager_s_security_nightmare">via</a>.
I'm not exactly on one side or the other, but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1363263921960980485">I do think distributions
should be honest about what they're asking for</a> and I
don't think they're going to get it.)</p>

<p>This hot take is a bit too narrow. What really matters is software
authors and modern software systems restricting the versions of
dependencies (for both maximum and minimum versions). Explicit or
implicit bundling on top of that just makes the problem slightly worse
for distributions.</p>

<p>For software authors, restricting the versions of dependencies that
they work with reduces the amount of work that they have to do,
both to test against a range of versions and to either forever chase
after whatever changes those dependencies like to make or to forever
limit what features of dependencies they use to ones available in
old versions (and sometimes both at once). In theory, both testing
and chasing after changes would be dealt with by <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> (if everyone followed it), at least for a
single program. In practice, not only are people fallible but also
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SemverHasLimits">people have a different understanding of what semantic versioning
means</a> because semantic versioning is ultimately
a social thing, not a technical one. Our field's history has shown
(sometimes vividly) that if software authors allow versions of
dependencies to move on them, soon or later things break and the
software author has to fix it.</p>

<p>(There's also the practical issue that not all dependencies even
claim or agree to follow semantic versioning in the first place.)</p>

<p>For distributors, once software authors start restricting versions
the distributor has both an upgrade problem and a distribution
problem. On the upgrade side, dealing with an issue in a program may now
require persuading it to accept a new version of a dependency. On the
distribution side, it's now likely that you'll have multiple programs
that have different version requirements for the same dependency. At the
very least this multiplies the packages involved.</p>

<p>(Many distributions also have package system design problems that
restricts the range of versions of things that they can have installed
at the same time. Even under <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>, this is a
problem for the distribution the moment that you have two programs
with conflicting version requirements that can't both be packaged and
installed at the same time.)</p>

<p>However, there's no free lunch here. What distributors want when
they ask for unbundled dependencies without version restrictions is
for software authors to do the work to accept any version of their
dependencies, or at least any version that falls within <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a>, and for dependencies to faithfully follow semver and
also make it possible to package and install different major versions
(at least) at the same time. <strong>Accepting a broad version range of your
dependencies is actual work</strong>, even apart from the limitations it may
impose on what your code and your software can do. Software authors and
the creators of software package ecosystems (like Go and Rust) are not
refusing to do this because they don't like distributions; they are
refusing to do this because they have found, over and over again, that
this doesn't really work and does cause problems for software authors
(and often users of programs) in the long run.</p>

<p>(The software community that's gone through this experience the
most visibly is Go, which started out with intrinsically unversioned
dependencies that were used universally across all your programs
by default and wound up switching to strongly versioned dependencies
after many people had many problems with that initial state. Go
experienced so many problems that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/FallibleSemverAndMVS">they adopted an unusually strict
and software author friendly versioning scheme</a>.)</p>

<p>It's popular for people to argue that software authors should be doing
this work anyway even if the distributions weren't asking for it,
so them actually doing it is no big deal. This is quite convenient
for the people making the argument, but it doesn't make the argument
valid. Software authors don't owe anyone any work what so ever; they
do whatever work serves their needs and is interesting to them. With
limited time and interest, it's both rational and proper for software
authors to optimize for their own development.</p>

<p>PS: Generally distributions also want some combination of all software
to update to the latest version of their dependencies and for
dependencies to explicitly support older versions. This is also extra
work for software authors, especially when the distribution also wants
it to happen for older versions of programs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>Time has washed up more than some lost films</strong> as regards the life of Fritz Lang. Recent research has cast a new light on Lang’s first marriage and while the private lives of screen personalities rarely interest me, in this case it has already affected how his films are being viewed by at least by one recent biographer. The events concerning his first wife occurred either in the post-production of “Das wandernde Bild” or “Vier um die Frau” or the pre-production of “Der müde Tod,” although even that is a guess.</p><p><strong>Lang’s first wife was named Lisa Rosenthal</strong> although no source is absolutely positive about that and she is described – in some accounts – as a “Russian from Vilnius.” Little else is known about her and it is not her life that is fascinating as much as it is her death. One reference that I found was in Robert A. Armour’s <em>Fritz Lang</em>, published by Twayne Publishers in 1977. Armour wrote, “[Fritz] Lang divorced his first wife and married [Thea] von Harbou.”</p><p><strong>Lang didn’t divorce Lisa Rosenthal.</strong> Rosenthal died of a gunshot wound to the chest and therein hangs a tale that Lang left behind when he fled from Germany in 1933. The story is told in Patrick McGilligan’s <em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast </em>and the recap goes something like this: Thea von Harbou was married to actor Rudolf Klien-Rogge and when her affair with Lang – that was no secret to the film community – heated up, she moved out of her home with Klien-Rogge and moved into the same apartment building as Fritz Lang. One day Lisa Rosenthal comes home unexpectedly and finds Lang and Harbou engaged in “violent petting,” as Lang described it later, on the sofa. Shortly thereafter, Rosenthal is found dead in the bathtub from a gunshot to the chest delivered by Lang’s WWI sidearm that he kept as a memento. Phone calls were made but it wasn’t the police that were called immediately and suspicions flew. Harbou and Lang swore that Rosenthal shot herself and there was little the police could do and Lang and Harbou were charged with denial of assistance although that charge was soon dropped.&nbsp;</p><div id="Layer4">
    <p><strong>Suspicion fell on Lang that he had shot Lisa Rosenthal</strong> and émigrés brought that story to Hollywood years later although only in hushed tones and never when Lang was within earshot. No one has ever suggested that Thea von Harbou was in any way involved although obviously, if Lang killed his wife, von Harbou was some sort of accomplice even if only after-the-fact. What’s interesting in all of this is that so little is known about von Harbou. </p>
    <p><strong>There is talk that after “Der müde Tod”</strong> was finished Lang was committed to an insane asylum for a brief stay. Lang would mention in interviews that he visited insane asylums as a part of his research. The truth is lost to time. At this point all that remains is stories and gossip. Patrick McGilligan wrote, “No record of an inquest – no record, even, of Lisa Rosenthal’s death – could be found in the course of research for [<em>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</em>].” Studio executives – including Erich Pommer – showed up at the scene and much like Hollywood moguls they influenced and cajoled the police to protect their star. </p>
    <p><strong>Frederick Ott in <em>The Films of Fritz Lang</em></strong> describes the death of the unnamed Frau Lang as an “apparent” suicide. Lotte Eisner in <em>Fritz Lang </em>states that Lang’s wife “committed suicide” and wrote in her biography <em>Ich hatte einst ein schones Vaterland: Memoiren</em>, published in 1984 and never translated into English: “[Lisa Rosenthal] then went into the bedroom [sic] and shot herself.” </p>
    <p><strong>McGilligan states: “Perhaps suicide</strong> was such a familiar condition in his mind that it leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue unbidden when the police arrived at his apartment on that fateful day, asking him to explain the inexplicable.” McGilligan bases this assumption on the content of Lang’s work stating that: “From the first film to the last, guilt, complicity, false accusation, irredeemable crime, inadvertent killings, and suicide haunt Lang’s work.” All of that is true except for the “guilt” and McGilligan seems to skip over the murders in Lang’s films. What “leapt to Fritz Lang’s tongue” implies that something else had occurred and there is only one other possibility. McGilligan then writes: “After the death of Lisa Rosenthal, the litany [of suicides in Lang’s films] is compelling.” McGilligan then lists the suicides in Lang’s films and describes them as “unmistakable thematic statements.” </p>
    <p><strong>According to one study of Weimar films,</strong> the three major themes in the top 25% of the films were guilt [about starting WWI], generational issues and suicide. Suicide was common in the films of Weimar as it would be later in films in France and Asia. It began to wane in the years of the Hays Code in the United States.</p>
    <p><strong>To attempt to solve whether Lisa Rosenthal’s death</strong> was murder or suicide by the content of the films Fritz Lang made after the event – especially the Hollywood films where Lang rarely had influence over the script – doesn’t make for a compelling case. Especially since a list of murders in Lang’s films would run even longer than a list of suicides. </p>
    <p><strong>Then again, a pistol being</strong> within grasping range shows up in Lang’s films quite often. McGilligan has produced an excellent biography of Lang and presents research that helps to understand the times that Lang lived. Where the author isn’t as impressive is in his understanding of the films and filmmaking as an art (eg, his description of the ending of “Spione” is inaccurate). There is no Hollywood ending to this story, no convenient set of symbols pointing to a resolution. There is only a dead woman with a gunshot chest wound bleeding in a bathtub and a lot of unanswered questions. That’s the end of the story. </p>

<p>According to aviation expert Joris Melkert, it is a special incident: “<em>I cannot remember a recent case in the Netherlands where parts of an engine fell down.</em>”</p>
<p>The cause of the incident is unknown. The engine may have sucked up something causing the turbine blades to break. This is what the debris looks like, says the airport spokesman.</p>
<p>The police are calling on people to leave the debris behind, in connection with recording the damage.</p>
<p>The Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid (Dutch Safety Board) has started an exploratory investigation.</p>
<p>Spotter Aubrey Verbaere was present at Liège Airport when the Longtail Boeing 747 landed and provided <em>Aviation24.be</em> with the following pictures:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post marks the start of a series of posts about the internals and interesting bits of various Windows based <strong>I</strong>nter-<strong>P</strong>rocess-<strong>C</strong>ommunication (IPC) technology components. Initially this series will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Named Pipes</li>
  <li>LPC</li>
  <li>ALPC</li>
  <li>RPC</li>
</ul>

<p>A few IPC technology components are therefore left out, but I might append this series sometime and include for example some of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Window Messages</li>
  <li>DDE (which is based on Window Messages)</li>
  <li>Windows Sockets</li>
  <li>Mail Slots</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright so let’s get down to it with Named Pipes…</p>

<p>Although the name might sound a bit odd pipes are a very basic and simple technology to enable communication and share data between two processes, where the term <strong>pipe</strong> simply describes a section of shared memory used by these two processes.<br>
To term this correctly right from the beginning, the IPC technology we’re speaking about is called ‘pipes’ and there are two types of pipes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Named Pipes</li>
  <li>Anonymous Pipes</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time when speaking about pipes you’re likely referring to Named Pipes as these offer the full feature set, where anonymous pipes are mostly used for child-parent communications. This also implies: Pipe communication can be between two processes on the same system (with named and anonymous pipes), but can also be made across machine boundaries (only named pipes can talk across machine boundaries). As Named Pipes are most relevant and support the full feature set, this post will focus only on Named Pipes.</p>

<p>To add some historical background for Named Pipes: Named Pipes originated from the OS/2 times. It’s hart to pin down the exact release date named pipes were introduced to Windows, but at least it can be said that it must have been supported in Windows 3.1 in 1992 - as this support is stated in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/win_dos_dev_jrnl_v4n4_apr_93/page/n23/mode/2up?q=Pipes">Windows/DOS Developer’s Journal Volume 4</a>, so it’s fair to assume named pipes have been added to Windows in the early 1990’s.</p>

<p>Before we dive into the Named Pipe internals, please take note that a few code snippets will follow that are taken from my public <a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/tree/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server">Named Pipe Sample Implementation</a>. Whenever you feel you want some more context around the snippets head over to the code repo and review the bigger picture.</p>

<h2 id="named-pipe-messaging">Named Pipe Messaging</h2>

<p>Alright so let’s break things down to get a hold of Named Pipe internals. When you’ve never heard of Named Pipes before imaging this communication technology like a real, steel pipe - you got a hollow bar with two ends and if you shout something into one end a listener will hear your words on the other end. That’s all a Named Pipe does, it transports information from one end to another.<br>
If you’re a Unix user you sure have used pipes before (as this is not a pure Windows technology) with something like this:
<code>cat file.txt | wc -l</code>. A command that outputs the contents of <code>file.txt</code>, but instead of displaying the output to STDOUT (which could be your terminal window) the output is redirected (“piped”) to the input of your second command <code>wc -l</code>, which thereby counts the lines of your file. That’s an example of an anonymous pipe.</p>

<p>A Windows based Named Pipe is as easily understood as the above example. To enable us to use the full feature set of pipes, we’ll move away from Anonymous Pipes and create a Server and a Client that talk to each other.<br>
A Named Pipe simply is an Object, more specifically a <strong>FILE_OBJECT</strong>, that is managed by a special file system, the <strong>Named Pipe File System (NPFS)</strong>:</p>

<p>When you create a Named Pipe, let’s say we call it ‘fpipe’, under the hood you’re creating a FILE_OBJECT with your given name of ‘fpipe’ (hence: <u>named</u> pipe) on a special device drive called ‘pipe’.<br>
Let’s wrap that into a something practical. A named pipe is created by calling the WinAPI function <strong>CreateNamedPipe</strong>, such as with the below [<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeServer/CPP-Basic-PipeServer.cpp#L88">Source</a>]:<br></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HANDLE</span> <span>serverPipe</span> <span>=</span> <span>CreateNamedPipe</span><span>(</span>
    <span>L"</span><span>\\\\</span><span>.</span><span>\\</span><span>pipe</span><span>\\</span><span>fpipe"</span><span>,</span>	<span>// name of our pipe, must be in the form of \\.\pipe\&lt;NAME&gt;</span>
    <span>PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX</span><span>,</span> <span>// open mode, specifying a duplex pipe so server and client can send and receive data</span>
    <span>PIPE_TYPE_MESSAGE</span><span>,</span>	<span>// MESSAGE mode to send/receive messages in discrete units (instead of a byte stream)</span>
    <span>1</span><span>,</span>			<span>// number of instanced for this pipe, 1 is enough for our use case</span>
    <span>2048</span><span>,</span>		<span>// output buffer size</span>
    <span>2048</span><span>,</span>		<span>// input buffer size</span>
    <span>0</span><span>,</span>			<span>// default timeout value, equal to 50 milliseconds</span>
    <span>NULL</span>		<span>// use default security attributes</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For now the most interesting part of this call is the <code>\\\\.\\pipe\\fpipe</code>.<br>
C++ requires escaping of slashes, so language independent this is equal to <code>\\.\pipe\fpipe</code>. The leading ‘\.’ refers to your machines global root directory, where the term ‘pipe’ is a symbolic link to the NamedPipe Device.</p>

<p><img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_SymbolicLink.png" alt="NamedPipe SymbolicLink"></p>

<p>Since a Named Pipe Object is a FILE_OBJECT, accessing the named pipe we just created is equal to accessing a “normal” file.<br>
Therefore connecting to a named pipe from a client is therefore as easy as calling <code>CreateFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeClient/CPP-Basic-PipeClient.cpp#L58">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HANDLE</span> <span>hPipeFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>CreateFile</span><span>(</span><span>L"</span><span>\\\\</span><span>127.0.0.1</span><span>\\</span><span>pipe</span><span>\\</span><span>fpipe"</span><span>,</span> <span>GENERIC_READ</span> <span>|</span> <span>GENERIC_WRITE</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span> <span>OPEN_EXISTING</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once connected reading from a pipe just needs a call to <code>ReadFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeClient/CPP-Basic-PipeClient.cpp#L65">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span><span>hPipeFile</span><span>,</span> <span>pReadBuf</span><span>,</span> <span>MESSAGE_SIZE</span><span>,</span> <span>pdwBytesRead</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before you can read some data off a pipe, you want your server to write some data to it (which you can read.). That is done by calling - who would have guessed it - <code>WriteFile</code>[<a href="https://github.com/csandker/InterProcessCommunication-Samples/blob/master/NamedPipes/CPP-NamedPipe-Basic-Client-Server/CPP-Basic-PipeServer/CPP-Basic-PipeServer.cpp#L110">Source</a>]:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WriteFile</span><span>(</span><span>serverPipe</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>messageLenght</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>bytesWritten</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But what actually happens when you “write” to a pipe?<br>
Once a client connects to your server pipe, the pipe that you created is no longer in a listening state and data can be written to it. The user land call to <code>WriteFile</code> is dispatched to kernel land, where <code>NtWriteFile</code> is called, which determines all the bits and pieces about the Write-Operation, e.g. which device object is associated with the given file, whether or not the Write-Operation should be made synchronous (see section <a href="#overlapping-pipe-io-blocking-mode--in-out-buffers">Overlapping Pipe I/O, Blocking mode &amp; In-/Out Buffers</a>), the I/O Request Packet (IRP) is set up and eventually <em>NtWriteFile</em> takes care that your data is written to the file. In our case the specified data is not written to an actual file on disk, but to a shared memory section that is referenced by the file handle return from <code>CreateNamedPipe</code>.</p>

<p>Finally - as mentioned in the introduction - Named Pipes can also be used over a network connection across system boundaries.<br>
There are no additional implementations needed to call a remote Named Pipe server, just make sure that your call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea">CreateFile</a> specifies an IP or hostname (as with the example above).<br>
Let’s make a guess: What network protocol will be used when calling a remote pipe server? …. drum rolls … absolutely unsurprising it is <strong>SMB</strong>.<br>
An SMB connection is made to the remote server, which is by default initialized by a negotiation request to determine the network authentication protocol. Unlike with other IPC mechanisms, such as with RPC, you as a server developer can not control the network authentication protocol as this is always negotiated through SMB. Since Kerberos is the preferred authentication scheme since Windows 2000, Kerberos will be negotiated if possible.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> From a client perspective you can effectively choose the authentication protocol by choosing to connect to a hostname or to an IP. Due to the design of Kerberos it cannot handle IPs very well and as such if you choose to connect to an IP address the result of the negotiation will always be NTLM(v2). Whereas when you connect to a hostname you will most likely always end up using Kerberos.</p>

<p>Once the authentication is settled, the actions that client and server want to perform are once again just classic file actions, that are handled by SMB just as any other file operation, e.g. by starting a ‘Create Request File’ request as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_RemoteRead.png" alt="NamedPipe RemoteRead"></p>

<h3 id="data-transfer-modes">Data Transfer Modes</h3>

<p>Named pipes offer two basic communication modes: byte mode and message mode.</p>

<p>In <strong>byte mode</strong>, messages travel as a continuous stream of bytes between the client and the server. This means that a client application and a server application do not know precisely how many bytes are being read from or written to a pipe at any given moment. Therefore a write on one side will not always result in a same-size read on the other. This allows a client and a server to transfer data without caring about the size of the data.</p>

<p>In <strong>message mode</strong>, the client and the server send and receive data in discrete units. Every time a message is sent on the pipe, it must be read as a complete message. If you read from a server pipe in message mode, but your read buffer is too small to hold all of the data then the portion of data that fits in your buffer will be copied over to it, the remaining data stays in the server’s shared memory section and you’ll get an error 234 (0xEA, ERROR_MORE_DATA) to indicate that there is more data to fetch.</p>

<p>A visual comparison of the messages modes is shown below, taken from “Network programming for Microsoft Windows” (1999):
<img src="https://csandker.io/public/img/2021-01-10-Offensive-Windows-IPC-1-NamedPipes/NamedPipe_MessageModes.png" alt="NamedPipe Message Modes"></p>

<h3 id="overlapping-pipe-io-blocking-mode--in-out-buffers">Overlapping Pipe I/O, Blocking mode &amp; In-/Out Buffers</h3>

<p>Overlapping I/O, Blocking mode and In-/Out Buffers are not amazingly important from a security standpoint, but being aware that these exists and what they mean can aid understanding, communication, building and debugging named pipes. Therefore I will add these concepts here briefly.</p>

<p><strong>Overlapping I/O</strong><br>
Several Named Pipe related functions, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile">ReadFile</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile">WriteFile</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-transactnamedpipe">TransactNamedPipe</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-connectnamedpipe">ConnectNamedPipe</a> can …</p></div></div>

<p>There were countless times when I’ve heard something like “I’ll leave this behind” in different forms from different people. Or even as a question: “what are you going to leave behind?”. People say this being serious, they don’t have a clue. This socially-accepted principle, saying that a finite life is okay and aging is a good argument in any controversy and a respectable excuse for virtually anything, is wedged deeply and firmly into their heads. But…<span id="more-20"></span></p>
<p>If you’re not alive, you’re nothing. And the world doesn’t exist for you, too. So does everything (or everybody) you’ve left there, because <strong>you</strong> don’t exist in the first place. You’ll become nothing. Void. Zero. What a null pointer points to.&nbsp;Just try to imagine this. You’re reading this blog post right now, but in a single moment it disappeared. As did a device you’re reading it on, as did a room where you’re doing that, as did a&nbsp;server where it’s hosted, as did the city, as did the country, as did the planet, as did you… <strong>Nothing</strong>. Everything just turned into nothing, including yourself. See that? Great, let’s move on.</p>
<p>This is a main argument when there are no valid arguments left. It is typically used as follows:<br>
— Whenever you’ll have children…<br>
— I’m not going to have any children.<br>
— How come? Are you alright?<br>
— Yes, I’m perfectly fine. I just don’t see any point in that. I’ll better improve myself.<br>
— But wait, you need to procreate.<br>
— For what exactly?<br>
— <strong>Who are you going to leave behind?&nbsp;</strong><span>(this can come in different forms, including “who’s going to bring flowers to your grave”, but the meaning is always identical)</span><br>
That’s all, every following argument is invalid. After this, I usually start reciting the beginning of this post.</p>
<p>If I’m going to cease to exist, it doesn’t matter what would be in a world without me. Because if I’m not going to exist in it, it’s not going to exist for me; that’s like a full-featured end of the world. If I’m not going to cease to exist, there’s also no reason to have children: they’re only needed because of mortality, they require inadequate amounts of time, they add a crapload of new responsibilities and ultimately make a human a slave of circumstances for at least 15 years. For what? For nothing, just because. Don’t seek a rational explanation, you won’t find it. It doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>One another argument that people really like using: “<strong>they’ll do for you everything you want/dream of</strong>“, or even “<strong>children are our immortality</strong>“. And it’s not valid, too. They won’t do for you things you want; they’re separate personalities, not your own helper robots. They’ve got their own life and their own missions in it, and it’s in no way a sequel to any of parents’ lives. It’s like a new branch in a version control system, if you know what I mean. A branch that will develop by itself and, most likely, will never get back to master, no matter how much you’d like to think the opposite. It’s much more useful both for yourself and for the humanity to improve yourself instead of teaching basic things to a brand-new human that’s going to take his own route, and that route likely won’t match yours. So no, children are not our immortality. They are the best way to kill time (and eventually yourself).</p>
<p>— <strong>But evolution…</strong><br>
Seriously? No. It’s no longer needed. Imagine this world as it was 300 years ago. There was&nbsp;no internet and computers, no electricity, no cars, planes, and trains, many of those things we can’t live without today just weren’t invented back then. All of this had been invented or discovered in those last 300 years. Impressive, isn’t it? And the scientific and technical progress isn’t going to stop. Can you remotely guess what new will be introduced in the XXI century? So can’t I. Do you see how fast the humanity is developing? It does so by itself, without any external intervention and without any help from the nature. Natural evolution was intended to adapt species to the environment but it’s not of much help for a modern human because he can adapt to anything himself, and do so a billion times faster and more efficiently. People are going to the space because they’ve invented rockets and space suits, something the natural evolution won’t ever do. We’ve already superseded the evolution, so we don’t actually need it any more.</p>
<p>— <strong>But that’s natural…</strong><br>
Are you living for yourself or for the nature? If the latter, immediately quit your internet, find yourself a partner of the opposite gender and go to an uninhabited island, without any belongings. It’ll be a success if you hit 30 years living there. It’s natural to reach puberty, pass some genetic material along and die, not to read posts in my blog. The nature isn’t our friend. It’s our enemy. Yes, it gave us our lives, it gave us this planet with everything we can find on it. But you also shouldn’t forget that the nature stands behind, among all other things, the most terrible diseases humanity had ever seen, natural disasters and, ultimately, the fact that the human life is finite. If the nature doesn’t care about humans, why should humans care about it?</p>
<p>— <strong>But it’ll be boring to live forever!</strong><br>
You’ve got tired of your life, it became dull and everything around you drives you crazy? Take a nap. Play some video games. Read some reddit. Chat with your friends. Learn a new skill. Go traveling somewhere. But please, don’t say that the life can become boring to the stage where you’ll want to terminate it. Because <strong>you can’t have unsolvable problems as long as you’re alive</strong>, whereas a dead person has exactly one such problem: they have no way to come back to life.&nbsp;So no, it won’t become that boring. Any problems go away as time goes by, except the aforementioned one.</p>
<p>So, you can really come to one conclusion from all of this:</p>
<h2>The meaning of life is to keep on living.</h2>

                    <p><img src="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4.-Getting-started-with-code-coverage-for-Golang.svg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p><a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golang</a>, developed in 2009, is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. At Codecov, it currently sits as the language of choice for over 14% of our open-source repositories, or as the 3rd most widely used language. This blog post will show you how to get a simple Golang project up and running with tests and code coverage with Codecov. You can view the entire source code of this post at our <a href="https://github.com/codecov/example-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example repository</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting started with Goloang</h2>
<p>We will start with a simple calculator app that exposes two functions: <code>Add</code> and <code>Subtract</code>. Both functions accept two integer arguments and return an integer. We can paste the code below into a file called <code>calculator.go</code>.</p>
<p><code>calculator.go</code></p>
<pre><code>package calculator

func Add(x, y int) int {
  return x + y
}

func Subtract(x, y int) int {
  return x - y
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s add a test for our <code>Add</code> function. We can take advantage of Go’s built-in testing libraries to do this. Open a new file called <code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<p><code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<pre><code>package calculator

import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
  if got, want := Add(1, 2), 3; got != want {
    t.Errorf("add method produced wrong result. expected: %d, got: %d", want, got)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The test file will call the <code>Add</code> function and compare its output with our expected value of 3. The test helps ensure that if we change the function later, it will still work as expected.</p>

<h2>Run your tests and get coverage locally</h2>
<p>You can run the test locally by calling <code>go test</code> This should bring up the following successful output.</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; go test
PASS
ok  	{{ SRC_DIRECTORY }}	0.178s
</code></pre>
<p>We can, again, use Golang’s built-in coverage tools to start collecting code coverage</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; go test -race -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.out
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	{{ SRC_DIRECTORY }}	0.160s
</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>covermode</code> and <code>race</code> are not required parameters, they are highly recommended by the Codecov team. <code>coverpofile</code> ensures that we collect coverage, and the metrics will be saved to the file specified, in our case, <code>coverage.out</code>.</p>

<h2>How to upload to Codecov</h2>
<p>Now that we are able to run coverage locally, we can begin uploading these reports to Codecov. We will be taking advantage of Codecov’s <a href="https://docs.codecov.io/docs/about-the-codecov-bash-uploader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bash uploader</a> to do this. We will not go into detail about setting up a pipeline, but Codecov will work with any CI/CD. Below, we show you basic configurations for <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a> and <a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CircleCI</a>.</p>
<p><b>GitHub Actions</b></p>
<pre><code>name: Test and coverage

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: '1.14'
      - name: Run coverage
        run: go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        run: bash &lt;(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)
</code></pre>
<p><b>CircleCI</b></p>
<pre><code>version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/golang:1.15
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run tests and coverage
          command: go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic
      - run:
          name: Upload coverage to Codecov
          command: bash &lt;(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)

workflow:
  version: 2.1
  build-test:
    jobs:
      - build
</code></pre>
<p>You will notice that both configurations call <code>bash &lt;(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)</code> which will handle uploading the report to Codecov.</p>
<p>If we commit these files to a pull request and run our CI, we expect Codecov to comment on our PR with coverage information like below:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.16-300x271.png" alt="" width="300" height="271" srcset="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.16-300x271.png 300w, https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.16.png 755w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<h2>Covering uncovered code</h2>
<p>You will notice that our <code>calculator.go</code> file is only 50% covered which matches with our local coverage. So how can we see what lines aren’t covered? We can click the report from the comment to browse our report</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.21-300x146.png" alt="" width="300" height="146" srcset="https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.21-300x146.png 300w, https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.21-1024x499.png 1024w, https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.21-768x374.png 768w, https://about.codecov.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Greenshot-2021-01-29-17.41.21.png 1163w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The light green background indicates that all of the above code was added. The darker green bar shows us that that line has been covered by tests, while the red is still uncovered. This makes sense as we only wrote a test for our <code>Add</code> function. The <code>Subtract</code> function still needs a test.</p>
<p>We can add the following code to our test file</p>
<p><code>calculator_test.go</code></p>
<pre><code>func TestSubtract(t *testing.T) {
  if got, want := Subtract(3, 2), 1; got != want {
    t.Errorf("Subtract method produced wrong result. expected: %d, got: %d", want, got)
  }
}

		<p>Posted here on this day Sunday, Dec. 9, 2012 C.E.</p>
		<p>Crafting in MMORPGs is a troublesome, complex issue. The ability for players to create things with which to equip, clothe, and house themselves is difficult for developers to implement, and many companies have tried a variety of ways to try and address this feature. My first real experience with crafting in MMORPGs was in Star Wars: Galaxies, and that has colored my view on crafting ever since. This is not to say that SWG had a perfect system, but it came closest out of all the MMOs I’ve played. This is chiefly due to the following eight factors. This is a fairly long read, so grab a cup of coffee, put on your bunny slippers, and sit back in your favorite chair.</p>
<h2 id="i-item-decay">I: Item Decay</h2>
<p>In early Star Wars: Galaxies, items decayed over time and would eventually become unusable. If an item ever became unusable, it was done - you couldn’t repair it, like in other games since. Even if you repaired items before they became unusable, you were never able to bring it back to full durability. The item’s maximum durability decreased every time you repaired it. The effect this had on the player economy was to keep crafters in business perpetually. There was always a demand for things like weapons and armor, because those players who engaged in combat were always wearing out their gear. Vehicles, after they were added to the game, similarly decayed and could be outright destroyed. I remember distinctly being very upset whenever I lost a swoop, since that meant a long walk back to town and around 20,000 credits spent to replace it. This system of item decay has never been replicated in any other game.</p>
<h2 id="ii-customization">II: Customization</h2>
<p>When crafting an item in SWG, you were able to choose its final appearance in a few ways. Clothing was the most customizable, with a variety of colors available. Weapons could have different models with different barrels (in the case of blasters). Armor, similarly, could have multiple colors. The skill level of the crafter determined to what degree the item could be customized. This meant that high-level crafters were in high demand for those players who cared about appearances, and could charge more for their services. Oddly enough, item customization as far as appearance goes has never been done very well in MMORPGs. That crown goes to Blacklight: Retribution, a free-to-play online FPS with excellent weapon customization. The game lets you change barrels, stocks, triggers, bodies, accessories, and colors of all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="iii-experimentation">III: Experimentation</h2>
<p>Part of the crafting process in Star Wars: Galaxies allowed you to improve the quality of a crafted item before finishing it. You could choose multiple areas to try and improve; in the case of blasters, for example, you could experiment on increasing damage, range, or accuracy. Depending on the crafter’s skill and the materials used to create the item, experimentation could greatly enhance, marginalize, or utterly wreck a crafted item’s stats. No other game since has implemented an item-modification system quite like this.</p>
<h2 id="iv-resource-variation">IV: Resource Variation</h2>
<p>Every resource in Star Wars: Galaxies had a unique set of statistics. Different kinds of item recipes used different sets of these statistics to determine the item’s qualities. Additionally, resource spawns in the game universe varied by planet and were in limited areas and densities. Every week, a new set of resources would spawn throughout the universe, and the old spawn areas were gone forever. This meant no resource would ever appear more than once, and really good resources thus became very precious. Because of this system, harvesting itself became a lucrative business. Some players devoted multiple accounts just to collecting the best resources and selling them to other players. Some games have come close to this kind of variation. Oddly, the one that has nearly replicated SWG’s resource variation is an MMOFPS rather than an MMORPG - Firefall. Like SWG, Firefall’s resources appear for a limited time, have multiple statistics that are randomly generated, and never appear twice.</p>
<h2 id="v-automated-harvesting">V: Automated Harvesting</h2>
<p>This feature made a world of difference to the crafting economy. Players could craft automated harvesters and place them in the world. Then, the player that placed the harvester chose one of the resources available in that area from the harvester’s command panel, and it would steadily recover a certain amount of that resource every minute or so. Harvesters required fuel to operate, which itself was a resource that could be harvested. Harvesters could be experimented on and improved in multiple areas, just like other items, and so a niche market existed just for harvesters. Harvesters had an administration list that allowed the owner to designate other players as being able to turn on, fuel, and change the target resource for them. Since every character only had 10 plots, and each harvester took 1 plot, in order to field large numbers of harvesters a player would need to either have multiple accounts or engage the services of other players. This further supported a niche market for harvesting. No other game has ever had automated harvesting, although the idea of harvesting as a lucrative in-game “profession” has been done also by EVE Online.</p>
<h2 id="vi-mass-production">VI: Mass Production</h2>
<p>In addition to automated harvesters, players could craft and place factories. These buildings took power and maintenance credits like harvesters. They also had a hopper of limited space for ingredients and for generated items. At the end of the crafting process, players had the option of creating a blueprint instead of a finished item. They could take that blueprint, and stacks of the ingredients used to produce the item, and place them in a factory. Once the factory was turned on, it would generate copies of that item until it ran out of power, maintenance credits, ingredients, or available space in the output hopper. Not only was this a godsend for crafters looking to mass produce items for sale, it also was a requirement to create certain items. Many of the higher-end crafted items required “identical” components - that is, stacks of items created by a factory from a blueprint. No other game has ever done this. While not a requirement for a good crafting system, it’s necessary to support sandbox games that rely on player crafted items, since small populations can still create large numbers of items.</p>
<h2 id="vii-loot-sucks">VII: Loot Sucks</h2>
<p>Players that chose to engage in PvE gameplay in SWG relied heavily on the crafters. Items looted from humanoid NPCs were never very good, and creatures had no loot at all until later in SWG’s life. This meant that player-crafted gear was the only option for combatants, and required players to work together in order to play the game. Lone wolves rarely did well. No MMORPG other than early SWG has ever done this again. Even SWG itself later did away with this, preferring to give players vendor trash, crafting components, and crafting blueprints.</p>
<h2 id="viii-non-instanced-housing">VIII: Non-Instanced Housing</h2>
<p>Non-instanced housing itself is not particularly relevant to crafting. However, the way it was implemented in SWG makes it vital to that ecosystem. All player-owned buildings were player-crafted. Harvesters, factories, houses, guild halls, city halls, shuttleports, med centers, and taverns were all created by players. And they were very expensive to build, at least at first. When player cities were first added to the game, I was my guild’s Architect (an in-game profession dedicated solely to crafting buildings). Leading up to the release of player cities, we stockpiled large quantities of the resources needed to build the various city buildings. As soon as the update went live, I sat at my structure crafting station and put together a city hall deed, and we rushed to be one of the player cities on our planet. At the time, only ten cities could be established on any given planet. We were too late to be one of the cities on Corellia, so we hurriedly traveled to its moon, Tarus, and set down roots a kilometer northwest of the Imperial outpost there. In order to craft that city hall, and any high-end items, I need a personal crafting station of the appropriate type for the item. Public crafting stations couldn’t stand in for them. Personal crafting stations needed to be placed in a player house, and they took a number of advanced components. They had a direct impact on the final quality of items, so all serious crafters absolutely had to have access to a house with all the different types of personal crafting stations. This led to most guilds having dedicated “crafting houses” that were so equipped, with backpacks placed in them with large quantities of the various resources needed for crafting. No other game has ever had non-instanced housing with such a rich connection to player crafting - both in the building and usage of them. That brings me to the end of my list. I wish I could find a game that had all of these features. SOE may be bringing all of this back with EQ Next, but until we get a science-fiction MMORPG that has all of the above, I don’t think we’ll ever come close to what Star Wars: Galaxies had. Here’s to hoping, though!</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The book is exciting and the story is funny. In fact, I'm learning something new. So much so, that I keep writing down my ideas and shuffling their implications. And suddenly, I realize something. In the past 15-minutes, I've only managed to cover three pages and I'm already thinking about next things I'm supposed to do. Cleaning, picking-up the groceries, doing my excercises, writing a couple of lines of code, watching a movie... </p><p>Is this supposed to be my Saturday off work?</p><p>So I stop and think. When was the last moment that took longer than 10 seconds, where I didn't have an urge to check an app on my phone, see if I got new email, or impulsively do something else?</p><p>By now, where I live, it's been many months of nightly curfews and limitations on travel and social life. I consider myself a very fortunate person to have suffered a relatively small impact from the global pandemic. Nonetheless, I can't stop but think about why my mind feels so exhausted while at the same time requiring a constant stream of stimulus that results in overbearing distraction. </p><p>It was already before the pandemic that I heard my colleagues talking about "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_detox"><em>digital detox</em></a>" and discussing their efforts to break out of being constantly connected while trying to regain their energy and allowing for some rest. Thus, I surely know that I'm not alone with these thoughts. </p><p>Finally, after subscribing to <a href="https://amzn.to/3alEC3u">Audible</a> last summer, there only remains little time in my day when I am not stimulating my brain in one way or another. It was some sort of a panic that hit me when I realized that I am no longer able to enjoy a thing that I've always enjoyed so much, reading a great book at length. </p><p>Today I called with a good friend of mine and he said: </p><p><em>"Yeah right! It's like we must constantly be multitasking or something... Even when I get to playing a Playstation game and it starts to load, I just all the time have to unlock my phone and check what is going on..."</em></p><h2 id="to-observe-and-reflect">To observe and reflect</h2><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/notes/the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant-by-eric-jorgenson/amp/">a book where Naval describes</a> what meditation means for him, and I cannot help but agree with his way of putting it. </p><p>One only needs to stop and observe his thoughts in a calm state. Your mind is like a monkey in a room, misbehaving and throwing feces all over the walls. It is fascinating how you realize this while trying to focus on your breath and not let your thoughts wander. In a matter of seconds, however, you already catch yourself thinking about entirely something different. When practicing to focus your attention and letting your thoughts pass, this inner monkey seems to eventually calm down and let you achieve a little peace of mind. It is not so easy. </p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-drawing-LBS-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>One year into the global pandemic - SL 2020 (LBS)</figcaption></figure><p>After so many months of being limited with our social interactions, it feels like the scariest thing out there is to be left by ourselves. Especially us young people tend to handle this quite badly. Without typical distractions and mental stimulus available throughout our days, our mind starts to seek for something to occupy itself resulting in raised anxiety levels and stress. We are today forced to confront our inner selves like never before. </p><h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2><p>Billions of dollars are invested and brightest specialists are hired each year to engineer new distractions. They fight for every second of our limited attention spans, leading us further astray without us even noticing it. </p><p>When shortest breaks require distraction and only the rarest moments, such as taking a shower, offer a refuge from our electronic devices, how are we supposed to work towards our long-term goals? The type of goals that can only be achieved when managing to work in a state of sustained attention? Rarely do great things in life come in a form of neatly packaged gratification to which we are getting more and more accustomed to. </p><p>Reading reports and hearing on the radio that the general feeling and wellbeing in our societies during these challenging times is again on decline, constant distractions might truly be the enemy that stands in our way of what we ought to achieve.</p><h2 id="fighting-back">Fighting back</h2><p>At some point I read that <a href="https://qz.com/1476157/overworked-south-koreans-are-finding-solace-in-a-fake-prison/">South Koreans already pay to live in a hotel-like "prison"</a> to relieve themselves from digital devices. I'm not quite ready to go that far just yet. </p><p>Admittedly, a cottage in the middle of nowhere in Finland would be the way to go anyways.</p><figure><img src="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/content/images/2021/02/santeri-mikkeli-LBS.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Late autumn lakeside view - Year 2016, Finland</figcaption></figure><p>Once upon a time before the pandemic I saw a colleague of mine use his phone as we were picking up lunch, and I couldn't help but ask why was the screen black and white? He told me he does it intentionally to make his handset less attractive, resulting in less tapping around. That struck me as bizarre. How odd, do we really need to resort to such approaches? </p><p>So what were some of the smaller changes I did to improve my wellbeing? </p><p>Unlike South Koreans with their voluntary confinement, or my friend with his greyscale screen, I started with some less drastic measures. These small changes proved enormously helpful. </p><p>First of all, I opened the screen-time function on my phone and looked through apps that sent me most notifications, proceeding to drastically dial them back. Today, most phones have a feature to limit the screen-time of apps, locking you out after a certain amount of time has passed. This function is plain useless for me or my friends whom I've seen to just enter their pin every single time they wanted to do something. What I did instead was that I just plain and simply uninstalled Instagram. </p><p>I had contemplated to delete it for a long time and almost did it, but instead always settled to just disable the notifications. When I finally did this however, two interesting realizations struck me. </p><p>First thing was that during the initial couple of weeks without the app I was totally surprised at how little I missed it. It literally had never provided me with anything of value, and I only used it to post an occasional update. Why didn't I uninstall it earlier? There was no feeling of missing out. Wow, this realization echoed a feeling that I had after uninstalling 9GAG many years earlier. </p><p>Second, I didn't even notice how those colorful icons on the home-screen invited me to tap on their respective apps as soon as I found myself aimlessly scrolling through my phone. I understood this in a particularly strong way after hiding another app, LinkedIn. Being an important tool for my work, all I did in addition to hiding it from the homescreen was to disable the last types of notifications I ever received from them. Lo' and behold, I now use this application significantly less and it makes a whole world of a difference. </p><p>Simple, easy and fast. Your life will be better for it, just try! Exponential returns of joy are expected if you have apps like Tiktok, Clubhouse, Snapchat, or other such platforms installed or bookmarked, that you can easily subject to the same fate and never look back.</p><p>So far, I'm mostly talking about my precious free time. But what could be some simple and small things that I could do when I'm working on my projects? </p><h2 id="focus-operate-and-enjoy-the-results">Focus, operate and enjoy the results</h2><p>I've written about doing <a href="https://www.lostbookofsales.com/why-to-do-lists-often-stink-and-how-do-the-truly-successful-people-maintain-their-productivity/">an experiment and turning myself into a productivity monster</a> back in 2017, and I've recently re-read the post and carefully re-implemented some of my learnings this year. But then again, it's not about going radical, but rather focusing on some small things that are easy to implement. </p><p>Kill the unnecessary Slack and Teams notifications now! Adjust the surprisingly good defaults that Slack provides and make sure none of them, except for the most important notifications, hit your phone after your working hours are over. </p><p>Use effective time-blocking techniques like <a href="https://alphaefficiency.com/20-minutes-pomodoro-weekly-experiment/">Pomodoro</a> for the less pleasant and repetitive, but still important tasks. This, like many other things, I've also learned from one of my colleagues using it in an effective manner.</p><p>Oh, and of course make sure to consider the following crazy important golden rule of life and the universe:<strong> </strong>don't do anything else while having a one-on-one interaction with someone. Just never do this. </p><p>I catch myself with this one sometimes and no matter how small of a signal, it can still tell something to my counterpart. Such mistakes during limited and valuable interactions in these pandemic-ridden times can eat away from our important professional relationships. When having conversations, focus on them fully and wholeheartedly. Multitask when the time is right. </p><p>Oh, and try drinking less coffee in the mornings while cutting alcohol in the evenings, but you've heard this a million times before. Additionally, to all of you who have small kids at home, I truly salute your efforts and patience getting through with this! </p><h2 id="the-most-desired-skill-of-the-future">The most desired skill of the future</h2><p>What if the most sought after and desired skill of the future will be the ability to best manage our constant distractions and maintain a sustained state of productive focus? </p><p>If we can't manage to control our whims, we won't be able to work effectively towards our long-term goals. I guess it's just that simple. </p><p>The first step is to stop and observe. </p><p>Reflection and brutal honesty with oneself while trying to understand what is happening is critical before driving corrections and adjustments into one's behavior. As our society adjusts to challenges posed by global pandemics, there is a chance for us to walk out of this stronger than before. This is a chance for us to learn more about ourselves than would've otherwise been possible, right? </p><p>I'm only trying to think about something positive in these pandemic-ridden times.</p><p>Now let's get back to work...</p><hr><p><em>Author's comment:</em></p><div><p><em>If you enjoyed this post, consider subscribing for an occasional update.

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

                    <p>Docker on MacOS will always be slower than on Linux (well, unless Apple Silicon ends up panning out, which it looks like it might!), but it doesn't have to be as <em>infuriatingly slow</em> as it is by default. &nbsp;In fact, you can get it pretty close to native speed and it's not even all that difficult. &nbsp;It turns out that developing with Docker on MacOS can actually be a really enjoyable experience, not just a compromise you make in order to have a portable development environment.</p><p>The problem is that the default file sync strategy that Docker on MacOS uses is <em>garbage.</em> &nbsp;Sure, it's consistent and compatible, but it's just about the slowest possible option you could go with. &nbsp;As your Docker app runs, it reads and changes files across that sync, which means that every file access slows down your application a little bit more. &nbsp;Compounded, that means that even your average runs are <em>bitterly slow</em>.</p><p>Enter Mutagen. &nbsp;Mutagen does a lot of things and is a very interesting technology in general, but what we're primarily interested in is how it can perform lightning-quick syncs between your local computer and a Docker volume. &nbsp;How fast is it? &nbsp;Well, the title of this article isn't hyperbole, in fact, it's underselling things. &nbsp;My Jest test suite went from taking 73.5 seconds to run to only taking 22.9 seconds (on average).</p><p>So now that we know what the problem is and what the solution is, let's fix Docker on MacOS.</p><p>First, you have to install Mutagen, and as of the writing of this article, you need to install a beta release. &nbsp;We need version 0.12.0 or higher, since that's the version that starts supporting <code>mutagen compose</code> (which we'll get to in a minute). &nbsp;There should be fairly low risk from this, though, since Mutagen's own website says:</p><blockquote><a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/introduction/installation#development-channels">Beta channel releases are fairly stable and can be thought of as something akin to release candidates.</a></blockquote><p>To install Mutagen and start the sync daemon, first, make sure you have <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, and then:</p><pre><code>$ brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-beta
$ mutagen daemon start</code></pre><p>Next, you'll need to modify your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to define the sync that Mutagen will spin up. &nbsp;Assume your current <code>volumes</code> entry for a container looks like:</p><pre><code>    volumes:
      - .:/code</code></pre><p>You'll want to create a new section at the bottom of your file with an <code>x-mutagen</code> configuration. &nbsp;<code>mutagen compose</code> will read that and build your sync from the options you set there:</p><pre><code>x-mutagen:
  sync:
    defaults:
      ignore:
        vcs: true
      mode: "two-way-resolved"

    mount-code:
      alpha: "."
      beta: "volume://mount-code"</code></pre><p><code>alpha</code> is where you're syncing <em>from</em>, and <code>beta</code> is the sync mount point that Mutagen will create. &nbsp;Also of note is the <code>two-way-resolve</code> sync mode we're using. &nbsp;<a href="https://mutagen.io/documentation/synchronization#modes">Mutagen has great documentation on how its synchronization modes work</a>, but in short, we're using the mode that prioritizes host files. &nbsp;Since this is development and the files on the host system are the canonical ones anyway, this is safe and prevents conflicts that have to be manually resolved.</p><p>Finally, we have to update our <code>volumes</code> entry to use the new mount point:</p><pre><code>    volumes:
      - mount-code:/code</code></pre><p>And that's it! &nbsp;Well, that's <em>nearly</em> it. &nbsp;<code>docker-compose</code> doesn't know how to read an <code>x-mutagen</code> entry, so instead we now run this file with the <code>mutagen compose</code> command, which is essentially a pass-through to <code>docker-compose</code> after having performed the various sync setup steps you've defined.</p><p>The first time you run this will be longer than before, as Mutagen will need to create the sync mount and perform the initial synchronization, but then it will run as a daemon and keep changes automatically in sync. &nbsp;I have found that occasionally it will run wild with the CPU for a couple dozen seconds as it updates its index (or something), but it hasn't significantly affected my development, especially not when compared against the <em>incredible</em> speed upgrades it provides.</p><h2 id="using-mutagen-in-nodewood">Using Mutagen in Nodewood</h2><p>Now that you have an idea how Mutagen works and how to set it up for your average project, I wanted to provide explicit steps for using it in your Nodewood projects.</p><p>(If you've arrived at this article from another site, you might not know what <a href="https://nodewood.com/">Nodewood</a> is. &nbsp;Nodewood is a JavaScript SaaS starter kit designed to save weeks or months of time when building your next web app. &nbsp;It comes with user authentication &amp; management, subscriptions, and a Docker development environment that is both easy to set up, and – thanks to Mutagen – lightning-fast to use. &nbsp;Interested in using Nodewood to build your next SaaS app? &nbsp;<a href="https://nodewood.com/">Read more here</a>.)</p><p>There are two steps to using Mutagen in Nodewood: 1) Using an application-specific <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and modifying your <code>.nodewood.js</code> configuration file to use Mutagen. &nbsp;(Of course, you'll need to make sure you've already installed Mutagen according to the instructions above.)</p><h3 id="1-set-up-an-app-specific-docker-compose-yml-file">1) Set up an app-specific docker-compose.yml file</h3><p>Nodewood will use a file in the <code>app</code> folder before it will use a file in the <code>wood</code> folder, and this applies to your Docker files as well. &nbsp;Create a file in <code>app/docker/docker-compose.yml</code>, and paste the following:</p><pre><code>version: '3'

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>After a public relations fiasco, Coca-Cola has effectively conceded that some of its employees participated in a public LinkedIn Learning seminar that advocated that some of its employees be “less white.”</p>
<p>The training curriculum was first exposed on Friday by Dr. Karlyn Borysenko, an organizational psychologist who is working to end the racially divisive ideology of ‘critical race theory.’</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨🚨 BREAKING: Coca-Cola is forcing employees to complete online training telling them to "try to be less white." </p>
<p>These images are from an internal whistleblower: <a href="https://t.co/gRi4N20esZ">pic.twitter.com/gRi4N20esZ</a></p>

<p>Since then, mainstream media and left-wing outlets had largely avoided the hot topic. However, Blaze Public Relations’ Chris Pandolfo obtained a statement from Coca-Cola that concedes its employees were told to take the seminar in question.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement from <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a>: <a href="https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz">https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz</a> <a href="https://t.co/DBIpsj5706">pic.twitter.com/DBIpsj5706</a></p>
<p>— Chris Pandolfo (@ChrisCPandolfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisCPandolfo/status/1362969629543522307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“The video circulating on social media is from a publicly available LinkedIn Learning series and is not a focus of our company’s curriculum,” Coca-Cola responded.</p>
<p>“Our Better Together global learning curriculum is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace.”</p>
<p>“It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long. The training includes access to LinkedIn Learning on a variety of topics, including on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will continue to refine this curriculum.”</p>
<p>It is important to note this wording concedes it <em>happened</em>. Furthermore, it is not “inclusive” to attack particular individuals’ racial background; that is, by definition, “exclusive.”</p>
<p>The LinkedIn Learning class, called “Confronting Racism, with Robin DiAngelo,” is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/confronting-racism-with-robin-diangelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">administered online.</a> DiAngelo, who has become famous for her infamous book “White Fragility,” has become somewhat of a celebrity by holding corporate struggle sessions on critical race theory. This has entailed charging <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up to $40,000</a> for half-day indoctrination courses to lecture audiences on the imagined perils of “whiteness” and “white fragility.<em>“</em></p>
<p>The prior description of the course included language that instructed people to be “less white.” We are not talking about a bug, but a feature of the lecture.</p>
<div>
<p>The course description said it will cover <em>“</em>understanding what it means to be white,” and “challenging what it means to be racist.” Students were instructed “to be less white is to: be less oppressive; be less arrogant; be less certain; be less defensive; be less ignorant; be more humble; listen; believe; break with apathy;” and “break with white solidarity.”</p>
<p>Author and pundit Candace Owens reacted to the revelation:</p>
</div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people how to “be less black”, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow. </p>
<p>I genuinely hope these employees sue <a href="https://twitter.com/CocaCola?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CocaCola</a> for blatant racism and discrimination. <a href="https://t.co/07OPZouEcV">https://t.co/07OPZouEcV</a></p>
<p>— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1362862767481446406?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“If a corporate company sent around a training kit instructing black people to ‘be less black’, the world would implode and lawsuits would follow,” Owens tweeted. “I genuinely hope these employees sue Coca-Cola for blatant racism and discrimination.”</p>
<p>“Your job at Coca-Cola should not depend on whether or not you buy into the idea of being less white,” Borysenko remarked. “It should depend on whether or not you can go in and do your job.” The organizational psychologist also walked viewers through what it all means on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWfS0SmNqw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Youtube video</a>.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is undoubtedly not the only company that has tapped DiAngelo and similar speakers, such as Ta-Nehisi Coates, to lead such trainings. Corporate social re-engineering efforts like diversity trainings are themselves big business. As the Free Beacon <a href="https://freebeacon.com/culture/the-wages-of-woke-2/">noted</a>, “the Diversity and Inclusion business was thought to be worth <a href="https://time.com/5696943/diversity-business/">$8 billion</a>&nbsp;as of 2003; by 2005,&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/an2018.pdf">65 percent</a> of big companies offered diversity training.”</p>
<p>Even more strikingly, the Free Beacon points out, there is little-to-no evidence that anti-bias trainings work:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5186d08fe4b065e39b45b91e/t/51e3234ce4b0c8784c9e4aae/1373840204345/Paluck_Green_AnnRev_2009.pdf">A review</a>&nbsp;of nearly 1,000 studies of anti-bias tools found little evidence that they have any impact. In fact, recent studies suggest anti-bias training’s primary effect may be to encourage discrimination: Firms with diversity training&nbsp;<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail">end up with</a>&nbsp;fewer minorities in management, and field research&nbsp;<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/dobbin_-_aatraining_clean.pdf#page=11">finds</a>&nbsp;that training both reinforces stereotypes and increases animosity against minority groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be that these “inclusion” seminars actually work the opposite of how they are intended: Instead of bringing people together, they raise awareness of our superficial differences and drive us further apart.</p>

February 20, 2021 | https://www.redahmeid.com/blog/just-say-no-to-versioning | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.redahmeid.com/blog/just-say-no-to-versioning">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-1dc2839754afdb686fff"><div><p>I don’t think it is giving away too much to say that I believe we should never version our APIs. I also know that as a concept, non-versioning is controversial. Interestingly, the disagreement in approaches usually, in my experience, is due to a fundamental core principle agreed upon by all. And that is, producers of APIs should not break consumers of APIs through change.</p><p>I think that is an excellent basis to start a conversation. My approach to debates is to find common ground as early into the discussion as possible and build from there. Therefore, let’s define that principle again more clearly.</p><blockquote><p><strong>API consumers expect never to be broken by a change in the API they consume.</strong></p></blockquote><p>I am sure that readers will in no way be surprised to learn that I am not the first to push the idea of no versioning. The concept has been around for many years. And yet, it’s still controversial. Roy Fielding, the man who wrote a thesis describing RESTFul APIs and introduced to the world the concept of HATEOAS (though the thesis never uses the weird acronym), is exact on the subject.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612171787005_4817"><div><p>Fielding talks about this in the context of REST APIs with a be damned if you go for non-REST attitude. In my opinion, REST is an elegant architectural style that does make building evolvable APIs easy, without succumbing to versioning. This post isn’t a place for detailing REST; there are plenty of better resources out there for that. But suffice to say using RESTFul principles for API design is probably a strong starting position.</p><p>However, REST is not the only solution, and good API design can overcome versioning. </p><p>Producers of APIs have broadly taken two approaches to not breaking consumers. The most common practice, and the one that is mostly considered the standard, is to version their APIs, usually deprecating the older versions and encouraging consumers to migrate. There are multiple ways taken of describing the version in the request. The most visible (and probably the one most organisations default to) is in the URL. Others will pass the version via the Accept header in the request. You will likely come across several resources that suggest this is best practice.&nbsp;</p><p>API versioning has downsides, irrespective of the patterns used. For one thing, supporting one version of anything is a pain. Finding a bug in one version necessitates affirmation that it doesn’t exist in other versions. If it does, there are a couple of options. Fix it in all versions, proportionally increasing the amount of testing needed. Or fix it in the latest version only and inform consumers that they need to move versions. And if it only exists in one place, should consumers move to a version without the bug (say the latest), or does a superseded version need fixing?</p><p>Some patterns minimise the pain of versioning. Advocates will argue that the concerns I raise are resolvable. And they are. And they have been resolved—however, it is fixing a self-inflicted issue. No versioning removes those worries. And for the consumer of your APIs, they benefit equally; they don’t need to change, are not broken by changes to the API, always have the latest functionality, and the documentation they need to read is minimal.</p><p>Let me backtrack slightly from my first sentence in this post. I believe versioning is unnecessary as I have yet to come across a situation in API design and development that needed versioning. I have yet to be convinced in practice that versioning is a necessity or even preferable. Below is the sort of conversation I have when suggesting we shouldn’t version.</p><blockquote><p><strong>What if we need to add a new mandatory field in the request?</strong></p><p>If it really is a “mandatory” field, why do you have a version of the API that doesn’t require it?</p><p><strong>We need it to carry out some new business logic?</strong></p><p>OK, a few things are going on here that we should talk through.</p><p>Again, this should not be described as a mandatory field or mandatory new business logic. If you support a version of the API that doesn’t need it, you support business functionality that doesn’t need it. At best, this is an optional field that may change the path your code goes down. Or if it is truly mandatory, why support a version that doesn’t include it?</p><p>Make the API contract as simple as possible by only requiring inputs that you have no way of working out yourselves. Make the internal workings of the API do the complex stuff, not forcing the consumer to do it. That way the contract can remain simple and your business logic and API avoid the brittleness caused by mandatory change.</p><p><strong>We made a spelling mistake in the field name, or we’re changing the style of fields. If we change the field names, it will break the consumers.</strong></p><p>So don’t change the field name. Consumers are using it fine. A colleague once pointed me in the direction of the HTTP header Referer. This is misspelt. There has been no suggestion that this should be corrected, as it was already in use. The same with API fields. If it is not harming, leave it.</p><p>However, if you really want to change the spelling, support both spellings. Maybe only document the new one but don’t break if the old spelling was used. Add a fitness function that indicates the trend in use of the old spelling vs the new. If the usage of the old spelling drops to a certain level, maybe then make a concerted effort to move the remaining clients across but highighting that you’ll stop supporting the old spelling.</p><p>But I go back to my first advice. Don’t bother changing the spelling. </p><p><strong>We want to change the structure of our response.</strong></p><p>This is an interesting one which I would usually dig a little deeper into. But I would start with why do you need to change the structure? I am sure you do but articulating why may help in designing it in a non-breaking way.</p><p>If necessary, consider content negotiation, where a consumer includes in the Accept header the media type they expect. If the structure is significantly different, maybe it isn’t a new version of the API, just a new representation of the resource that the API returns. </p><p>As with the above, handle the change internally, not force consumers to change.</p><p><strong>It’s not just a different structure, the response looks very different</strong></p><p>Roy Fielding points out during his discussions on versioning that if the API is so different that you need to version, maybe it isn’t a different version of the API -maybe it is a completely different API.</p><p><strong>Github version their APIs</strong></p><p>I think Github do APIs really well. If you used them as your exemplar, you wouldn’t go far wrong. Github is on version 4 of their APIs. How do I reconcile the two views (i.e. GitHub are good, don’t do versioning)?</p><p>I could start by restating that phrase. Github is <span>only</span> on version 4 of their APIs after 13 years. That is one new version every 3 (and a bit) years. But still, it is a new version.&nbsp;</p><p>Another thing to note is that they versioned all their APIs at the same time. Not individual versioning. And there is a reason for that. The move from version 3 to version 4 was a move from REST APIs to GraphQL. They didn’t version the APIs. They versioned their architectural style.</p><p>While I am not privy to the thinking behind this, if you visit the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en">Github docs home page</a> they do not talk about version 3 and version 4 of their APIs, but the REST APIs and GraphQL APIs. I’d suggest this is further evidence they see this as a change of architectural style. Maybe, and now I am guessing, the version number is an easy way to differentiate in the URL or indicates the direction of travel they intend to take. Either way, I would strongly suggest they don’t version APIs but simply architecture. And if there were a valid reason to use versioning, this is it.</p></blockquote><p>The above is a sanitised conversation, and readers will likely identify other scenarios requiring versioning, which I would love to hear about in the comments.  I’m even happy to work with people on the design. I don’t want this to seem like a straight forward thing to do, especially if you do not start from a solid API design base. When you consider versioning as an option, take into account the following:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Make all changes to response or request optional rather than mandatory.</p></li><li><p>If they are mandatory changes, why do you support a version that doesn’t have those changes? </p></li><li><p>Keep the API contract as simple as possible. Limit the number of input requirements to what is absolutely necessary to make the system work. Any business logic inputs should be retrieved from internal sources as much as possible. By making the API do the work, changes to the contract will be rare.</p></li><li><p>Would the change to the API benefit every consumer? If not, think about how impactful the change is for consumers who don’t need it?</p></li><li><p>Would you support every version forever? Or will you start to decommission versions and force consumers to move across?</p></li><li><p>Is the change due to new business logic? If so, will the new business logic be part of every version?</p></li><li><p>If the change is due to new business logic, should that even be a concern for your consumers?</p></li><li><p>Does a new version make things easier or more challenging for the consumers of your APIs?</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, ask yourself one question if the case for versioning seems strong; “does the benefit of this change justify the time, effort and impact of supporting multiple versions, to our consumers and us?”. The success of your APIs is in making them easy to consume. That should include not forcing the consumer to change. Rethink the approach to anything that makes API consumption more difficult. Do the hard work at the design stage, and hopefully, you’ll have easy to use, evolvable APIs that will be maintainable and keeps everyone happy.</p></div></div></div>]]>

Chemical recycling, in contrast, involves breaking down the long polymer chains of plastic with heat or solvents to retrieve the material's initial monomer components.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the obstacles to developing chemical-recycling technology is also a reason why plastic is a useful material: the strong carbon-carbon bonds in its molecular structure. Polyethylene, the most common kind of plastic, requires at least 600 degrees Celsius to break those bonds to retrieve the monomers, and is chemically recycled at a rate lower than 10%.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œStability of the hydrocarbon chains is rather a problem in that case,â€� said Stefan Mecking, the lead author of the study and the department chair of chemical materials science at the University of Konstanz in Germany. â€œTo really break them down into small molecules needs high temperatures and is energy intensive, and also the yields are not that good.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The plastic compounds created by Mecking and his colleagues had chemical bonds that could be more easily broken so chemically recycling them would be more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">Chemically recycling the two materials, which were forms of polyester and polycarbonate, required placing them in ethanol or methanol with a catalyst at only 120 degrees Celsius, or 150 degrees without the catalyst. The researchers then cooled and recrystallized the plastic before filtering it out. In the case of the polycarbonate, 96% of the initial material was recovered.</p><p dir="ltr">As demand in the recycling industry stalls and recyclable materials pile up in warehouses and landfills, chemical recycling has been offered as part of a solution to reduce plastic waste. The industry group American Chemistry Council has <a href="https://plastics.americanchemistry.com/what-is-advanced-recycling/">praised</a> the emerging technology for the significant role it could play in a circular economy by reducing plastic waste and repurposing it into new products.</p><p>Yet the method is not without pushback. A <a href="https://www.no-burn.org/wp-content/uploads/CR-Technical-Assessment_June-2020.pdf">2020 report</a> by the environmental organization Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives criticized a lack of research and reporting in current chemical-recycling technologies and said the process is energy-intensive and may emit hazardous chemicals. Chemical recycling also distracts from efforts to limit plastic production to reduce waste, the organization said.</p><p dir="ltr">In the new research, the chemists found that the recycling process worked when the plastic contained dye or fillers such as carbon fibers, both of which cause challenges in mechanical recycling. The plastics were also successfully recovered when pieces of other plastics were included in the alcohol solvent.</p><p dir="ltr">Plant oils were chosen as starting materials for synthesizing the plastics primarily because of their useful long chains. They are also more sustainably sourced than the crude oil and other fossil fuels used to produce most of the worldâ€™s plastic material.</p><p dir="ltr">The new plastics were very similar to high-density polyethylene, the widely used plastic labeled as recycling number . Testing by the chemists found that the three materials had comparable properties such as structure, elasticity and molecular weights â€” though the polycarbonate and polyester had lower melting and crystallization points.</p><p dir="ltr">They were also better suited for 3D printing than polyethylene, and they retained their properties after recycling and reuse.</p><p dir="ltr">The one disadvantage of the new materials Mecking identified was their cost. Ethylene is the â€œcheapest building block of the chemical industry,â€� he said, so, "Competing with conventional polyethylene at the current market and legal framework conditions is very difficult.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Mecking and his colleagues are conducting ongoing research into using their new plastics for 3D printing, an initial application he said would be exciting for further developing the material and eventually scaling up its production.</p><p dir="ltr">These new plastics may also biodegrade in nature more quickly than common polymers because of their engineered break points, a line of inquiry that also interests the German chemist.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The article, â€œClosed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials,â€� was published Feb. 17 in Nature.Â&nbsp;</em><em>The authors of the study were Manuel , Marcel Eck, Dario Rothauer and Stefan Mecking, University of Konstanz. The lead author was Stefan Mecking.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<p>For those who don't follow Swift's development, ABI stability has been one of its most ambitious projects and possibly it's defining feature, <a href="https://swift.org/blog/abi-stability-and-more/">and it finally shipped in Swift 5</a>. The result is something I find endlessly fascinating, because I think Swift has pushed the notion of ABI stability farther than any language without much compromise.</p>
<p>So I decided to write up a bunch of the interesting high-level details of Swift's ABI. This <strong>is not</strong> a complete reference for Swift's ABI, but rather an abstract look at its implementation strategy. If you really want to know exactly how it allocates registers or mangles names, look somewhere else.</p>
<p>Also for context on why I'm writing this, I'm just naturally inclined to compare the design of Swift to Rust, because those are the two languages I have helped develop. Also some folks like to complain that Rust doesn't bother with ABI stability, and I think looking at how Swift <em>does</em> helps elucidate why that is.</p>
<p>This article is broken up into two sections: background and details. Feel free to skip to the details if you're very comfortable with the problems inherent to producing a robust dynamically linked system interface.</p>
<p>If you aren't comfortable with the basic concepts of type layouts, ABIs, and calling conventions, I recommend reading the article I wrote on <a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/">the basic concepts of type layout and ABI as they pertain to Rust</a>.</p>
<p>Also huge thanks to the Swift devs for answering all of the questions I had and correcting my misunderstandings!</p>

<p>I know a lot of people don't really follow Swift, and it can be hard to understand what they've really accomplished without some context of what the language is like, so here's a TL;DR of the language's shape:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exists to replace Objective-C on Apple's platforms, oriented at application development
<ul>
<li>natively interoperates with Objective-C</li>
<li>has actual classes and inheritance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At a distance, very similar to Rust (but "higher-level")
<ul>
<li>interfaces, generics, closures, enums with payloads, unsafe escape hatch</li>
<li>no lifetimes; Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) used for complex cases</li>
<li>simple function-scoped mutable borrows (inout)</li>
<li>Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiled</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on "value semantics"
<ul>
<li>structs/primitives ("values") are "mutable xor shared", stored inline</li>
<li>collections implement value semantics by being Copy-On-Write (CoW) (using ARC)</li>
<li>classes are mutably shared and boxed (using ARC), undermining value semantics (can even cause data races)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An emphasis on things Just Working
<ul>
<li>language may freely allocate to make things Work</li>
<li>generic code may be polymorphically compiled</li>
<li>fields may secretly be getter-setter pairs</li>
<li>ARC and CoW can easily result in surprising performance cliffs</li>
<li>tons of overloading and syntactic sugar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry about fully understanding all of these, we'll dig into the really important ones and their implications as we go on.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking"><a href="#what-is-abi-stability-and-dynamic-linking">1.2 What Is ABI Stability and Dynamic Linking</a></h2>
<p>When the Swift developers talk about "ABI Stability" they have exactly one thing in mind: they want native system APIs for MacOS and iOS to be written in Swift, and for you to dynamically link to them. This includes dynamically linking to a single system-wide copy of the Swift Standard Library.</p>
<p>Ok so what's dynamic linking? For our purposes it's a system where you can compile an application against some abstract <em>description</em> of an interface without providing an actual implementation of it. This produces an application that on its own will not work properly, as part of its implementation is missing.</p>
<p>To run properly, it must tell the system's <em>dynamic linker</em> about all of the interfaces it needs implementations for, which we call <em>dynamic libraries</em> (dylibs). Assuming everything goes right, those implementations get hooked up to the application and everything Just Works.</p>
<p>Dynamic linking is very important to system APIs because it's what allows the system's implementation to be updated without also rebuilding all the applications that run on it. The applications don't care about what implementation they get, as long as it conforms to the interface they were built against.</p>
<p>It can also significantly reduce a system's memory footprint by making every application share the same implementation of a library (Apple cares about this a lot on its mobile devices).</p>
<p>Since Swift is AOT compiled, the application and the dylib both have to make a bunch of assumptions on how to communicate with the other side long before they're linked together. These assumptions are what we call ABI (an Application's <em>Binary</em> Interface), and since it needs to be consistent over a long period of time, that ABI better be stable.</p>
<p>So dynamic linking is our goal, and ABI stability is just a means to that end.</p>
<p>For our purposes, an ABI can be regarded as 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#layout">The layout of types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/#calling-conventions">The calling convention of functions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling">The names of symbols</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can define these details and never break them, you have a stable ABI, and dynamic linking can be performed. (Ignoring trivial cases where both the dylib and application were built together and ABI stability is irrelevant.)</p>
<p>Now to be clear, ABI stability isn't technically a property of a programming language. It's really a property of a system and its toolchain. To understand this, let's look at history's greatest champion of ABI stability and dynamic linking: C.</p>
<p>All the major OSes make use of C for their dynamically linked system APIs. From this we can conclude that C "has" a stable ABI. But here's the catch: if you compile some C code for dynamic linking on Ubuntu, that compiled artifact won't work on MacOS or Windows. Heck, even if you compile it for 64-bit Windows it won't work on 32-bit Windows!</p>
<p>Why? Because ABI is something defined by the <em>platform</em>. It's not even something that necessarily needs to be documented. The platform vendor can just require you to use a particular compiler toolchain that happens to implement their stable ABI.</p>
<p>(As it turns out, this is actually the reality of Swift's Stabilized ABIs on Apple platforms. They're not actually properly documented, xcode just implements it and the devs will do their best not to break it. They're not opposed to documenting it, it's just a lot of work and shipping was understandably higher-priority. Thankfully I don't really care about the details, or the difference between the ABIs on MacOS and iOS, or implementations other than Apple's, so I can keep saying "Swift's ABI" and it won't be a problem.)</p>
<p>But if that's the case, why don't platform vendors provide stable ABIs for lots of other languages? Well it turns out that the language isn't completely irrelevant here. Although ABI isn't "part" of C itself, it <em>is</em> relatively friendly to the concept. Many other languages aren't.</p>
<p>To understand why C is friendly to ABI stability, let's look at its much less friendly big brother, C++.</p>
<p>Templated C++ functions cannot have their implementations dynamically linked. If I provide you with a system header that provides the following declaration, you simply can't use it:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
bool process(T value);
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <em>it has no symbol</em>. C++ templates are monomorphically compiled, which is a fancy way of saying that the way to use them is to copy-paste the implementation with all the templates replaced with a particular value.</p>
<p>So if I want to call <code>process&lt;int&gt;(0)</code>, I need to have the implementation available to copy-paste it with <code>int</code> replacing <code>T</code>. Needing to have the implementation available at compile-time completely undermines the concept of dynamic linking.</p>
<p>Now perhaps the platform could make a promise that it has precompiled several monomorphic instances, so say symbols for <code>process&lt;int&gt;</code> and <code>process&lt;bool&gt;</code> are available. You could make that work, but then the function wouldn't really be meaningfully templated anymore, as only those two explicitly blessed substitutions would be valid.</p>
<p>There would be little difference from simply providing a header containing:</p>
<pre><code>bool process(int value);
bool process(bool value);
</code></pre>
<p>Now a header <em>could</em> just include the template's implementation, but what that would really be guaranteeing is that that particular implementation will <em>always</em> be valid. Future versions of the header could introduce new implementations, but a robust system would have to assume applications could using either, or perhaps even both at the same time.</p>
<p>This is no different from a C macro or <code>inline</code> function, but I think it's fair to say that templates are a little more important in C++.</p>
<p>For comparison, most platforms provide a dynamically linked version of the C standard library, and everyone uses it. On the other hand, C++'s standard library isn't very useful to dynamically link to; it's literally called the Standard <em>Template</em> Library!</p>
<p>In spite of this issue (and many others), C++ <em>can</em> be dynamically linked and used in an ABI-stable way! It's just that it ends up looking a lot more like a C interface due to the limitations.</p>
<p>Idiomatic Rust is similarly hostile to dynamic linking (it also uses monomorphization), and so an ABI-stable Rust would also end up only really supporting C-like interfaces. Rust has largely just embraced that fact, focusing its attention on other concerns.</p>

<p>I have now made some seemingly contradictory claims:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swift has similar features to Rust</li>
<li>Rust's features make it hostile to dynamic linking</li>
<li>Swift is great at dynamic linking</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret lies in where the two languages diverge: dynamism. Rust is a <em>very</em> static and explicit language, reflecting the sensibilities of its developers and early adopters. Swift's developers preferred a much more dynamic and implicit design, and so that's what they made.</p>
<p>As it turns out, hiding implementation details and doing more work at runtime is <em>really</em> friendly to dynamic linking. Who'd've …</p></div></div>

<p>None of these scores meaningfully measure anything important about me.</p>



<h2>Scores don’t matter…</h2>



<p>Your time is your most precious asset. When you focus on these website scores, you’re giving away your most precious asset, just to enrichen company owners.</p>



<p>These scores don’t matter. These websites don’t even know your goals!</p>



<h2>…unless you made the score</h2>



<p>The scores that matter will be the ones you’ve created, that measure your progress to your own goals.</p>



<p>For example, I ran a <a href="https://www.cubcamp.org/">Cub Scout day camp</a> for four years. Wanting to have maximum positive effect on the community, I have a “go big or go home” approach to Scouting. I rated myself in part on how well the camp recruited participants. That is a score I made for myself. It helped us set new records.</p>

<h2>Focus for success</h2>



<p>If website scores end up being good, that’s fine! But make sure those great scores are merely incidental. They should not be your goal.</p>



<p>Focus on scores that matter. They will be the ones you created. They will help you know your path to your goals.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>This post is the second in a three-part series about
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a>.
In the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">first post</a>, I
described the context around Cranelift and our project to replace its
backend code-generation infrastructure, and detailed the
instruction-selection problem and how we solve it. The remaining two
posts will be deep-dives into some interesting engineering problems.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to dive into the <em>compiler performance</em> aspect of
our work more deeply. (In the next post we’ll explore correctness.)
There are many interesting aspects of compilation speed I could talk
about, but one particularly difficult problem is the handling of
<em>control flow</em>: how do we translate structured control flow at the
Wasm level into control-flow graphs at the IR level, and finally to
branches in a linear stream of instructions at the machine-code level?</p>

<p>Doing this translation efficiently requires careful attention to the
overall pass structure, with the largest wins coming when one can
completely eliminate a category of work. We’ll see this in how we
combine several passes in a traditional lowering design (critical-edge
splitting, block ordering, redundant-block elimination, branch
relaxation, branch target resolution) into <em>inline transforms</em> that
happen during other passes (lowering of the CLIF, or Cranelift IR,
into machine-specific IR; and later, binary emission).</p>

<p>This post basically describes the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/buffer.rs"><code>MachBuffer</code></a>,
a “smart machine-code buffer” that knows about branches and edits them
on-the-fly as we emit them, and the
<a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/blockorder.rs"><code>BlockLoweringOrder</code></a>,
which allows us to lower code in final basic-block order, with split
critical edges inserted implicitly, by traversing a never-materialized
implicit graph. The work was done mostly in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/1718">Cranelift PR
#1718</a>, which
resulted in a ~10% compile-time improvement and a ~25%
compile+run-time improvement on a CPU-intensive benchmark (<code>bz2</code>).</p>

<h2 id="control-flow-graphs">Control-Flow Graphs</h2>

<p>Before we discuss any of that, we need to review control-flow graphs
(CFGs)! The CFG is a fundamental data structure used in almost all
modern compilers. In brief, it represents how execution (i.e., program
control) may flow through instructions, using graph nodes to represent
linear sequences of instructions and graph edges to represent all
possible control-flow transfers at branch instructions.</p>

<p>At the end of the instruction selection process, which we learned
about in the <a href="https://cfallin.org/blog/2020/09/18/cranelift-isel-1/">previous post</a>, we have a function body lowered into VCode that consists of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_block"><em>basic blocks</em></a>. A basic
block is a contiguous sequence of instructions that has no outbound
branches except at the end, and has no inbound branches except at the
beginning. In other words, it is “straight-line” code: execution
always starts at the top and proceeds to the end. An example
control-flow graph (CFG) consisting of four basic blocks is shown
below:</p>

<p><img src="https://cfallin.org/assets/2020-10-08-cfg-web.svg" alt="Figure: Control-flow graph with four basic blocks in a diamond"></p>

<p>Control-flow graphs are excellent data structures for compilers to
use. By making the flow of execution explicit as graph edges, rather
than reasoning about instructions in order in memory as the processor
sees them, many analyses can be performed more easily. For example,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis">dataflow analysis</a>
problems can be solved easily because the CFG makes traversal of
possible control-flow transfers easy. Graph-based representations of
the program also allow easier <em>moving and insertion of code</em>: it is
less error-prone to manipulate an explicit graph than to reason about
implicit control-flow (e.g. fallthrough from a not-taken conditional
branch). Finally, the graph representation factors out the question of
<em>block ordering</em>, which can be important for performance; we can
address this problem separately by choosing how we serialize the graph
nodes (blocks). For these reasons, most compiler IRs, including
Cranelift’s CLIF and <code>VCode</code>, are CFG-based.</p>

<p>(Historical note: control-flow graphs were invented by the late
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Allen">Frances Allen</a>, who
largely established the algorithmic foundations that modern compilers
use. Her paper <a href="https://www.clear.rice.edu/comp512/Lectures/Papers/1971-allen-catalog.pdf">A catalogue of optimizing
transformations</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
covers essentially all of the important optimizations used today and
is well worth a read.)</p>

<h2 id="cpus-and-branch-instructions">CPUs and Branch Instructions</h2>

<p>To represent a CFG’s end-of-block branches at the instruction level,
we can use <em>two-way branches</em>: these are instructions that branch
either to one basic-block target if some condition is true, or another
if the condition is false. (Basic blocks can also end in simple
unconditional single-target branches.) We wrote such a branch as <code>if
r0, L1, L2</code> above; this means that the block <code>L0</code> will be followed in
execution either by <code>L1</code> or <code>L2</code>, depending on the value in <code>r0</code>.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="branches-with-fallthrough">Branches with Fallthrough</h3>

<p>However, CPUs rarely have such two-way branch instructions. Instead,
conditional control-flow in common ISAs is almost always provided with
a <em>conditional branch with fallthrough</em>. This is an instruction that,
if some condition is true, branches to another location; otherwise,
does nothing, and allows execution to continue sequentially. This is a
better fit for a hardware implementation for a number of reasons: it’s
easier to encode one target than two (the destination of the jump
might be quite far away for some branches, and instructions have
limited bits available), and it’s usually the case that the compiler
can place one of the successor blocks immediately afterward anyway.</p>

<p>Now, this isn’t much of a problem if we just want a working compiler;
instead of a two-way branch</p>



<p>We can write a sequence of branches</p>



<p>where <code>br_if</code> branches to <code>L1</code> or falls through to the unconditional
<code>goto</code>. But this is not so efficient in many cases. Consider what
would happen if we laid out basic blocks in the order <code>L0</code>, <code>L2</code>,
<code>L1</code>, <code>L3</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      goto L2
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      goto L3
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are two redundant unconditional branches (<code>goto</code> instructions),
each of which uselessly branches to the following instruction. We can
remove both of them with no ill effects, taking advantage instead of
<em>fallthrough</em>, or allowing execution to proceed directly from the end
of one block to the start of the next one:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    L0:
      ...
      br_if r0, L1
      // ** Otherwise, fall through to L2 **
    L2:
      ...
      goto L3
    L1:
      ...
      // ** Always fall through to L3 **
    L3:
      ...
      return
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seems like an easy enough problem to solve: we just need to
recognize when a branch is redundant and remove it, right? Well, yes,
but we can do much better than that in some cases; we’ll dig into this
problem in significantly more depth below!</p>

<h3 id="machine-code-encoding-branch-offsets">Machine-code Encoding: Branch Offsets</h3>

<p>So far, we’ve written our machine instructions in a way that humans
can read, using <em>labels</em> to refer to locations in the instruction
stream. At the hardware level, however, these labels do not exist;
instead, the machine code branches contain target <em>addresses</em> (usually
encoded as relative <em>offsets</em> from the branch instruction). In other
words, we do not see <code>goto L3</code>, but rather <code>goto +32</code>.</p>

<p>This gives rise to several complications when emitting machine code
from a list of instruction <code>struct</code>s.  At the most basic level, we
have to resolve labels to offsets and then patch the branches
appropriately. This is analogous to (but at a lower level than) the
job of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing)">linker</a>:
we resolve symbols to concrete values after deciding placement, and
then edit the code according to <em>relocations</em> to refer to those
symbols. In other words, whenever we emit a branch, we make a note (a
relocation, or “label use” in our <code>MachBackend</code>) to go back later and
patch it with the resolved label offset.</p>

<p>The second, and more interesting, problem arises because not all
branch instructions can necessarily refer to all possible labels! As a
concrete example, on AArch64, conditional branches have a ±1 MB range,
and unconditional branches have a ±128 MB range. This arises out of
instruction-encoding considerations: particularly in
fixed-instruction-size ISAs (such as ARM, MIPS, and RISC V), less than
a full machine word of bits are available for the immediate jump
offset that is embedded in the instruction word. (The instruction
itself is always a machine-word wide, and we need some bits for the
opcode and condition code too!) On x86, we have limits for a different
reason: the variable-width encoding allows either a one-byte offset
(allowing a ±128 byte range) or four-byte offset (allowing a ±2 GB
range).</p>

<p>To make a branch to a far-off label, then, on some machines we need to
either use a different sort of branch than the default choice for the
instruction selector, or we need to use a form of <em>indirection</em>, by
targetting the original branch to <em>another branch</em>, the latter in a
special form. The former is tricky because we do not know whether a
target will be in-range until all code is lowered and placement is
computed; so we need to either optimistically or pessimistically lower
branches to the shortest or longest form (respectively) and possibly
switch later. To make matters worse, as we edit branches to use a
shorter or longer form, their length may change, moving <em>other</em>
targets into or out of range; in the most general solution, this is a
“fixpoint problem”, where we iterate until no more changes occur.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-in-lowering-cfgs-to-machine-code">Challenges in Lowering CFGs to Machine Code</h2>

<p>So far, we have a way to produce <em>correct</em> machine code. To emit the
final code for a two-target branch, we can emit a conditional-
followed by unconditional-branch machine instruction. To resolve
branch targets correctly, we can assume that any target could be
anywhere in memory, and always use the long form of a branch; then we
just need to come back in one final pass and fill in the offsets when
we know them.</p>

<p>We can do much better than this, though! Below I’ll describe four
problems and the ways that they are traditionally solved.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-efficient-use-of-fallthroughs">Problem 1: Efficient use of Fallthroughs</h3>

<p>We described above how <em>branch fallthroughs</em> allow us to omit some
some unconditional branches once we know for sure the order that basic
blocks will appear in the final binary. In …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

    <p><strong>Microsoft</strong> founder Bill Gates just slammed cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. He <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-interview-advice-quotes-decisions-11613654671">said</a>, “It’d be good to get rid of that” while highlighting how cryptocurrency “allows for certain criminal activities” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>With this, Gates joined the legendary investors and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> CEO Warren Buffett — who has publicly expressed his hatred for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past. Before I discuss why the cryptocurrency market is extremely risky for small investors with a low-risk appetite, let’s explore what Gates and Buffett have to say about it.</p>
<h2>Bill Gates slams Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Gates is currently the world’s third wealthiest person. Bloomberg billionaires index estimates his net wealth to be around US$137 billion. In another <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1362405700878614532">interview</a> with CNBC on Thursday, Gates revealed neither he doesn’t have any Bitcoin position — long or short. Last year, Buffett also criticized cryptocurrency calling it worthless. Back then, he clarified that he would never invest in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>In his latest interview, Gates showered prases on <strong>Tesla</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-tsla-tesla-motors/737/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:TSLA)</a> CEO Elon Musk. He <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/bill-gates-says-we-need-more-elon-musks-to-tackle-climate-change.html">believes</a> “What Elon’s done with Tesla is fantastic,” calling it “…the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are part of how we solve climate change,” adding, “We need a lot of Elon Musks” and “he should be very proud of what he’s done.”</p>
<h2>Tesla’s big Bitcoin bets</h2>
<p>Tesla and its latest annual filing last week revealed that it <a href="https://www.fool.ca/2021/02/08/tesla-buys-bitcoin-is-dogecoin-next-for-elon-musk/">invested US$1.5 billion in Bitcoin</a>. The company also plans to start accepting Bitcoin as payment for its products soon. Tesla — which is now a part of the <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> — made its surprising Bitcoin purchase in January. As a result, investors who now own Tesla stock or S&amp;P 500 funds indirectly have stakes in the cryptocurrency market — whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>After Tesla’s big bets on Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market has recently seen a massive jump in its trade volume. Not many small investors know that the extremely volatile cryptocurrency market can ruin their years of saving in no time. The fact is you don’t need to buy Bitcoin to multiply your savings in the long term. You can do it the way Warren Buffett does it without taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<h2>Invest money the Warren Buffett way</h2>
<p>Buffett has made money consistently for decades from the stock market. He simply believes in buying good cheap stocks for the long-term to grow money. Buffett also prefers to invest his money in industries that have good future growth potential.</p>
<p>The demand for electric cars has surged in the last few years. Industry experts predict the 2020s to be the decade of electric and autonomous cars. That’s the reason even big tech companies like <strong>Apple</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nasdaq-aapl-apple/82/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NASDAQ:AAPL)</a> are ready to jump into the automotive industry.</p>
<p>The iPhone maker has secretly been working on its car project for years. It has poached many engineers and auto industry experts from many companies — including Tesla — lately. So, it shouldn’t surprise you if you see Apple launching its branded electric and autonomous car in the coming years.</p>
<h2>One great EV stock to buy today</h2>
<p>That’s why I expect businesses focused on electric and autonomous car technology to witness a massive growth in the coming years. For example, <strong>BlackBerry</strong> <a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/tsx-bb-blackberry/174/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(TSX:BB)</a><a href="https://www.fool.ca/company/nyse-bb-blackberry/176/" data-is-tickerizer-link="true">(NYSE:BB)</a> has been my favorite Canadian tech company with its increasing interest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicle-related technology.</p>
<p>The company recently partnered with <strong>Amazon</strong> Web services to develop its integrated vehicle data platform. The platform would allow automakers to access and utilize vehicle sensor data in real-time. BlackBerry is also expanding its market share in China — the world’s largest car market. The company’s QNX Neutrino operating system — in partnership with <strong>Baidu</strong> — will soon be used in mass-produced EVs in the country.</p>
<h2>Final thought</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market — at first — may look like an easy way to get rich. However, most retail investors with a small risk appetite tend to lose their money in cryptocurrency trading. That’s why it’s better to follow Buffett and stick to cheap high-growth stocks to multiply your hard-earned money.</p>

            <p>
	The trillion-dollar market value has a new member: bitcoin. The total number of bitcoins trading are now collectively worth more than US$1 trillion.</p>
<p>
	That's because the price of a bitcoin hit a number of new all-time highs Friday. One bitcoin currently costs nearly $53,400 -- and there are about 18.6 million bitcoins in circulation according to Coinbase. (The total number of bitcoin eventually available is capped at 21 million.)</p>
<p>
	Of course, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison to look at bitcoin versus big firms with sky-high valuations like Apple. But for what it's worth, only four companies in the United States currently are worth more than bitcoin: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google owner Alphabet.</p>
<p>
	Bitcoin currently is worth about $225 billion more than Tesla, the company that is most responsible for the most recent surge in the cryptocurrency's price.</p>
<p>
	The Elon Musk-led electric car juggernaut announced earlier this month that it now owns $1.5 billion's worth of bitcoin in its corporate coffers. Tesla also said it was looking at letting consumers use bitcoin to buy its cars and SUVs.</p>
<p>
	That news has sparked speculation that other big companies may soon add bitcoin or other cryptocurrncies to their balance sheets, since bitcoin is generating a significantly higher return than bonds and cash.</p>
<p>
	Corporate America is validating bitcoin. Payments giants Square and PayPal let their users buy and sell it. Credit card processing behemoths Visa and Mastercard are also embracing cryprocurrencies.</p>
<p>
	And a top strategist at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said on CNBC this week that the company has "started to dabble" in bitcoin as an investment.</p>
<p>
	All this has helped spark a wave of buying by average investors. Consumer research firm Piplsay wrote in a report Thursday that half of the more than 30,000 consumers it surveyed this week about bitcoin said they felt it was "safe" to invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>
	Bitcoin prices have surged more than 80% so far this year, and investors are enthusiastically scooping up other cryptocurrencies as well. Ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency with a total value of about $220 billion, has more than doubled this year.</p>
<p>
	And the price of dogecoin, a currency that originally started as a dog meme-based joke, also has skyrocketed this year following several bullish tweets about it by Musk and support from traders on Reddit.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo is a search engine that gives us the chance to recapture our privacy. Yes, DuckDuckGo does not store or share any information on its user data which extends to search history, cookies, and IP addresses. Whenever we think about search engines, the first thing that comes to our mind is Google and we have a more powerful Google suite to make our life easy, but Google takes a lot of information from us. And they utilize it in a variety of different ways! As the privacy issue gets bigger and bigger; we could see government policies take control in the current situation. &nbsp;Therefore, the DuckDuckGo could be able to see its popularity spiral up now. DuckDuckGo was founded in 2008, and they had approximately 23.7 billion search queries on their platform in 2020, based on their <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/traffic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traffic page</a>.</p>



<p>Due to the privacy policy, they do not have a record of the number of users those who are using the search engine, however as per CEO &amp; Founder at DuckDuckGo.com, “Since we do not track users, it’s impossible for us to know exactly how many users visit our site every month”, and yet according to their estimated guess the total comes to nearly 25 million people.</p>



<h2>What catches the privacy user with DuckDuckGo?</h2>



<ol><li>DuckDuckGo does not track you.</li><li>Not any search history backed up.</li><li>No Ads based on the user searches.</li><li>Cookies are not used by default.</li><li>Provides reasonable enough search results.</li><li>Well encrypted.</li></ol>



<h2>DuckDuckGo Versus Google</h2>

<h3>1. DuckDuckGo does not track you.</h3>



<p>As mentioned above Google traces everyone’s browsing history to offer more customized content. As a result, when a user goes to a website with Google’s advertising services, it sends information such as website URL, device’s IP address to Google and in return, Google provides the best results. On the other hand, <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> does not track users browsing at all. The browser also does not store any of the user data to serve them personally.</p>



<h3>2. Not any search history backed up.</h3>



<p>Google has a “Search History” option, which you can clear but it will be there, as evidence of what sites you visited. While DuckDuckGo search is anonymous, and as mentioned it does not track you, so each time you search something, your search history is not backed up anywhere.</p>



<h3>3. No Ads based on the user searches.</h3>



<p>When we search for something on Google, the first thing we come across is full of ads. However, this is not the same on DuckDuckGo. The search engine offers the least possible ads, and they are not providing ads based on your search, which will not on your profile or search history.</p>



<h3>4. Cookies are not used by default.</h3>



<p>Websites depend on cookies to keep users signed in. When you Fireproof a site, cookies will not be wiped out and you will remain signed in, even after using the fire button. DuckDuckGo does not save your data and it also has a feature that deletes all the data such as the recently visited site. However, this does not mean you will have to log in each time you open a website like Facebook in DuckDuckGo. It has a fireproof feature, in which the browser saves the login data of that site.</p>



<p>In Google, if you clear all the site data, you will get signed out from all the sites and there is no option to do that for a specific website.</p>



<h3>5. Provides reasonable enough search results.</h3>



<p>There might be a few disadvantages to completely cutting Google out of your life such as, Google search results are smarter than DuckDuckGo. and Google has it 91% market share under the most used search engine category. Still learning how to get the best search results can help you find what you want on the Internet without giving up personal information.</p>



<h3>6. Well encrypted.</h3>



<p>DuckDuckGo protects you from things like data breaches. The browser also has a feature described as "Smarter Encryption", which certifies more of your browsing will use encrypted connections (HTTPS). The way it works is they frequently maintain a list of sites that support encryption&nbsp; Google does not have any such feature and it shows all types of websites.</p>



<p>To sum up, the future of DuckDuckGo looks bright. They are always working on adding new features and opportunities to let their search engine users feel the quality of searching, at the same time protecting their privacy. They may have had a slow start, but when we think about their competition, they are getting ready for the battle and have set their brilliant goals already. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve been re-reading and re-listening to my Seth Godin book and audiobook library these last few weeks and one of the reoccurring themes Seth talks about over and over again is the vital importance of being “remarkable” and is the fundamental concept in his <a href="http://amzn.to/2ioctNq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img data-attachment-id="26420" data-permalink="https://paradigmprojects.com/books/advertising-is-the-tax-you-pay-for-being-unremarkable/attachment/purple-cow/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?fit=336%2C499&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="336,499" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Purple-Cow" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?fit=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?fit=336%2C499&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?resize=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="202" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?resize=202%2C300&amp;ssl=1 202w, https://i0.wp.com/paradigmprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Purple-Cow.jpg?w=336&amp;ssl=1 336w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>book<a href="http://amzn.to/2ioctNq" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong> Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable</strong></a> (a brown cow isn’t remarkable, a purple cow is so you remember it and talk about it).</p>
<p>And today when I was searching for an old Inc magazine article on the Inc website I ran across another article I thought was interesting an apropos regarding being “remarkable.” In asking Robert Stephens (Stephens is the founder of Geek Squad, a tech-support company that was acquired by Best Buy in 2002) Stephens answers to a question put to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I want to generate buzz about my executive search firm among potential clients. What is the best way to boost word-of-mouth marketing?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stephens reply is a great one and I give you<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20081001/ask-robert-stephens.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> this link</a> so you can read it on the Inc site but towards the end he said something that really caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Advertising is the tax you pay for being unremarkable.</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>So I’m thinking of now here in 2010 and beyond how can builders and remodelers stand out from the crowd by being remarkable?</p>
<p>For some suggestions on how to get unstuck and moving on the road to becoming remarkable a quick list of things to consider read Seth Godin post on his blog: <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/01/how_to_be_remar.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Seth’s Blog: How to be remarkable</strong></a>.

<p>We can't take it anymore, raged Sonja Ultsch in a video on Facebook last week. "We've already let them slap us on the left cheek for Ischgl, now we have to turn our right cheek, too!" It was a reference to the Austrian ski town that was responsible for one of the biggest outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in Europe during the first wave last year.</p>


<div>
<p>As if in a commercial for pleasant skiing holidays, the hotelier filmed herself against a sunlit Alpine backdrop, railing against the Austrian government's efforts to seal off Tyrol because of a major outbreak of the South African B.1.351 virus mutant in the region. "I’ve had it, let them lock us in!” Ultsch railed, her eyes hidden behind sunglasses along with pink lipstick and light blond hair. "But then we’re going to open everything here!”</p><p>The defiant video went viral, and Ultsch certainly spoke from the heart of many a Tyrolean. And not only them. There is probably no country in the world where people aren’t fed up with the lockdown, which has transformed from an emergency measure to an entire new way of being. The frustration and suffering is growing louder because of the pandemic’s depressing and seemingly nonstop reign.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>And ever since the virus mutants began spreading around the globe, even the last motivation for bravery is fading: the hope that the nightmare will soon end thanks to vaccination. Because as incredibly fast as it was possible to find and produce vaccines, the mutants were faster. And they are still faster.</p><p>For physicist and mathematician Michael Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig, one thing is clear: "Vaccination isn’t going to help us slow down the momentum of infections until the younger population has been immunized.” And what about higher temperatures in the spring and summer? It might help a bit, Meyer-Hermann thinks, when people start spending more time outside. "But that alone will in no way suffice.”</p>
</div>

<p>Meaning that the virus could continue to run rampant until enough people have been vaccinated.</p>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p>In addition, the South African and Brazilian variants have some particularly nasty characteristics. For one, it’s likely they can re-infect people who have already suffered from an infection with the original coronavirus. And the vaccines also appear to be weaker against the new strains.</p><p>It’s like a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/can-germany-stop-the-new-supervirus-a-e9ffc207-0015-4330-8361-b306f6053e15" data-link-flag="english">whole new pandemic</a> has begun with the mutants. Things had been looking pretty good in Germany: The incidence rate was falling and continues to fall, and the measures seem to be working. But now, still invisible in the mountain of case numbers, the highly contagious mutants are spreading, most notably B.1.1.7, the virus variant that overran the United Kingdom in a matter orfweeks and led Portugal to have the highest incidence levels in the world. It will inevitably dominate infection trends in Germany, as well. The question is no longer whether the dangerous mutants will run rampant, only when.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>This puts politicians in a bind. They are being forced to position themselves somewhere between two extremes, with one just as nightmarish as the other. On the one hand, you have the eternal lockdown, from which it is only ever possible to briefly emerge. On the other, by loosening up the measures, you risk giving the mutants free rein, which could push the case numbers in this country into the tens of thousands every day with many fatalities, including younger victims, people with long-term symptoms and constant series of new virus mutants.</p><p>Because this is also clear: High infection rates and increased numbers of people available for the virus to attack mean the virus can multiply freely. And with each replication, the likelihood increases of new mutations emerging. In most cases, more harmless, but also some more dangerous ones or even variations that are resistant to vaccines.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>What, then, is the country facing? It’s as if the pandemic has transported us into a weird state of limbo where people who are already pandemic-weary, frustrated and angry are granted a brief respite in which everything now depends on how they behave and decide to act.</p><p>It is possible to stop the mutant through a hard lockdown, as we are currently seeing in the UK and Ireland. But it is not possible to sustain that lockdown until a larger proportion of the population finally gets vaccinated in the summer or autumn. How much opening, then, is possible without the situation spinning out of control again? Scientists and politicians around the world are currently wrestling with that question. Last Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the governors of the country’s 16 states debated the issue.</p><p>The federal government and the governors decided to extend the current lockdown until early March, with restrictions placed on social contacts, social distancing and bars. Restaurants have been ordered to stay closed until at least March 7. The only rule to be loosened is that hairdressers can open their doors to customers again at the beginning of March. The German states will decide on their own when to reopen schools.</p><p>Ultimately, the politicians had to yield, at least in part, to the findings of scientists worldwide who are rushing to do research on the new mutants. The calculations of epidemiologists, in particular, predict a disaster if a relaxation of rules were to take place now, even if it were at primary schools.</p><p>Still, that didn’t prevent individual governors from causing the usual local chaos in loosening the lockdown rules the day after the federal and state decisions were made. Just an example: On Saturday, flower shops were allowed to reopen in Lower Saxony. They were allowed to open in Bavaria on Sunday, too, but only because it was Valentine’s Day. On March 1, the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein will allow garden centers, zoos and nail studios to reopen.</p><p>"The current measures aren’t even sufficient for stopping the exponential spread of the new variant,” says Meyer-Hermann of the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research. The physicist plugged all the basic assumptions available about the new variants into his models and calculated how they would affect the development of infections.</p><p>What he’s saying is that a third wave is coming.</p><p>Beyond Meyer-Hermann’s models, the figures from neighboring countries also show what will happen in Germany. British researchers have created an animation showing Britain divided into counties. It shows how B.1.1.7 starts in the south, soaking the country in a pale pink all the way up to the north until it becomes deep violet at lightning speed in the disease's march to victory.</p><p>The UK example also shows how hard the lockdown has to be in order to stop the mutant’s spread. And in Israel, we are currently seeing how the virus can evade even an aggressive vaccination strategy. It appears that it then just starts infecting more children - another unpleasant finding.</p><p>The numbers illustrating the success the B.1.1.7 mutant has had are quickly outdated. The week before last, the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s center for disease control, reported that the share of the British variant in Germany was just under 5.6 percent. By last Thursday, though, that figure had doubled to 11.2 percent. Less than a week later, it had almost doubled again to over 20 percent.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the city of Düsseldorf announced that B.1.1.7 had been detected in every fifth infected person there. An outbreak had occurred in a homeless shelter, among other places. In the northern German town of Flensburg, about one in three infections with SARS-CoV-2 was an infection with the British variant. And in the northern Bavarian regions of Hof, Wunsiedel and Tirschenreuth, the proportion of new mutants in the positive tests is already at 40 to 70 percent.</p><p>In Cologne, too, at the initiative of Florian Klein, director of the Institute of Virology at the city’s university hospital, all positive coronavirus samples are currently being examined for the new variants using a special PCR test. Right now, B.1.1.7 accounts for around 15 percent of all cases and the South African mutant for around 5 percent.</p><p>But the increase didn’t surprise the virologist. "There is no reason to assume that developments in Germany should be fundamentally different from those in other countries,” says Klein.</p><p>The latest figures indicate that the mutant from the UK currently has a reproduction number of 1.3, meaning that 10 infected people spread the disease to 13 others. "Then the number of cases doubles about every one to two weeks,” calculates physicist Viola Priesemann. If it were to stay that way, there would be more than 30,000 new infections a day in Germany again after Easter, despite the extension of the lockdown.</p><p>"According to our predictions, if you were to relax the (lockdown) rules now, then one would expect that B.1.1.7 would be dominant sometime in March,” says modeler Meyer-Hermann. Dominant means that the mutant would account for half of all infections.</p><p>It's still not clear exactly why B.1.1.7, but also the South African and Brazilian variants, manage to infect so many people so easily. However, virologists have identified the mutation that enables the pathogen to do so: It’s called N501Y and it affects the binding of the virus to host cells. According to the initial findings, it helps the pathogen infect a human being in a significantly shorter amount of time. As such, the definition of what can be described as a close contact may have to be changed.</p><p>Initially, it appeared that the new variants were killing disproportionately more than the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus simply because they were infecting so many more people. More recent data, however, has led to the …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>In late August 2020 I read <a href="https://press.stripe.com/#the-dream-machine">The Dream
Machine</a> and it is my favorite
book of 2020. It is an incredible overview of a sliver of computer pioneers in
the 1960s-1980s and how one man was instrumental in tying all their narratives
together. One of the strands the book follows is the group at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)">PARC</a> (and other places) that
firmly believed in the notion of interactive computing. Over the last year,
I’ve repeatedly been introduced to this strand of thinking. There is Douglas
Engelbart’s <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human
Intellect</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>
and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">mother of all
demos</a>. The notion that
computers should allow humans to <em>think better</em>, and one way to do that is to
allow humans to express and try out ideas better. <em>Writing</em> is a useful skill
to form coherent, but generally linear streams of thought. <em>Computing</em> is the
closest we can yet get to a non-linear exploration of a problem domain, and
freed from the limitations of time and space, we can recreate our thoughts in a
malleable, explorable way. By applying <a href="https://doriantaylor.com/softwares-ailing-mythology">a known process to known information,
but turning a few billion cranks at a
time</a> we can get to better
solutions, faster. The notion is, if we could have a <em>computer</em> (the physical
device including the software) that would allow people to iteratively express
their problems, get immediate sensory (primarily visual, but nothing prevents
using the other senses) feedback and <em>extend the computer as necessary</em>, we can
really liberate the human mind from some of its limitations. It is a very
different vision from the consensus reality of vendors that deliver
pre-packaged applications that all come with restrictions.</p>

<p>Smalltalk<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup> is one of the outputs of this strand of thinking and has had a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#History">big impact on general purpose programming
languages</a><sup id="fnref:bak"><a href="#fn:bak">3</a></sup>. However the
focus on object orientation and test-driven development have robbed the world
of what I think are its most important aspects:</p>

<ol>
<li>programming as a dialogue with the computer, with meaningful feedback and <em>assistance</em>.</li>
<li>the environment being just as important to programming as the language, and empowering users to <em>modify the environment to help solve their problem</em>.</li>
<li>semantic simplicity as a necessity for easier comprehension in the face of the above points.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aditya Siram has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch/baxtyeFVn3w">this excellent
talk</a> giving a taste of Smalltalk.
If you had to take only one thing away from this post, it is to go and watch
that. I knew I had to try this thing out! While I worked through the <a href="https://nikhilism.com/post/2021/experiencing-smalltalk/TODO">Pharo
MOOC</a> for a few days, I quickly lost interest in their examples. <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020">Advent
of Code 2020</a> (AoC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> seemed like a much
better avenue to really try out Smalltalk. All my experiences are based on the
<a href="https://pharo.org/">Pharo</a> variant, which seems to be the leading
implementation right now.</p>

<p>While I was working my way through AoC, Mike Levins wrote <a href="https://mikelevins.github.io/posts/2020-12-18-repl-driven/">On repl-driven
programming</a>. I
think he wasn’t fully able to convey the ideas of Smalltalk, because the term
“REPL” is too strongly associated with Python/JavaScript/Ruby REPLs at this
point. I hope I did my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642699">bit</a> of
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642717">evangelizing</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25642741">correct
that</a>. Alright, lets jump into
my experience.</p>



<h2 id="a-truly-integrated-development-environment-ide">A truly integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>

<p>What do I mean? Well Smalltalk really facilitates creating a program in an
exploratory style, including test-driven development. As an example, for Day 5,
I wrote the following:</p>



<p>Now, as soon as I “accept” this code (by pressing Ctrl+S), Smalltalk will ask
me if I would like to define this <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code> class. It will pop up
a little window to let me do that. It will also detect I wrote a test case
(because when I created a class for the test case, I inherited from <code>TestCase</code>)
and the system browser and other elements of the interface will have these
little gray/green/red dots next to every test case, letting me run the test and
observe the results right away. Now, this is offered in modern IDEs like
IntelliJ and PyCharm, but this was available 40 years ago in Smalltalk! But
that is just the beginning.</p>

<p>I can now run this test (remember I’ve only defined the <code>AOCBoardingPassParser</code>
class at this point) and it will encounter the missing method <code>toSeat:</code> on the
class (think of this like a “static method” in Java/Python<sup id="fnref:static"><a href="#fn:static">5</a></sup>). In a
statically typed language, you would get a compilation error or have your IDE
highlight it for you. If you were in a dynamic language, then you’d just have
an exception thrown when running the program – <code>AttributeError</code> in Python.
Unless you explicitly ran the test in a debugger, that is all you would get and
now you’ve to go back to the editor, fix this, then re-run the test.</p>

<p>Not so in Smalltalk. First this isn’t just an IDE in the sense of a
language-aware editor. The IDE is also very aware of the runtime environment.
It will break at the stack frame with the missing method, and pop up a window.
You can <em>create</em> a method right there. This window has a full fledged editor
with code completion and all the other fanciness right there. I’m not aware of
any other environment<sup id="fnref:lisp"><a href="#fn:lisp">6</a></sup> that does this. Ok so we quickly recover by
creating the method. But I don’t know exactly what to put in there yet. Don’t
worry, this is Smalltalk. We don’t need to go through this cycle of rerunning
the entire test. The state of the running program is <em>preserved</em> until the
point where you hit the error, and you just tell the IDE “ok, I’ve fixed the
immediate error, let’s try again” and it will resume execution from there! You
can do this as many times as you wish, developing the code as a function of
encountering errors and test failures. This very fast iteration cycle feels
amazing! Imagine writing a much more complex program that was running for
minutes to hours but then hit an error. In most languages you would have to fix
it and start from the beginning, but in Smalltalk you would just fix it right
there and proceed.</p>

<p>I think browser developer tools are the closest we can come to having this kind
of interactivity in widespread computing environments. They don’t do that yet,
but they could. But we need to acknowledge how much work had to be put in to
those tools vs Smalltalk. In addition, the that implementation would likely
need to be in C++ instead of JavaScript, which means users wouldn’t be able to
extend and improve it as necessary. Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<h2 id="ide-extension-and-visualization">IDE extension and visualization</h2>

<p>Where most IDEs and language implementations are written in C/C++/Java,
Smalltalk prides itself on bootstrapping from a very minimal native code core.
After that nearly everything about the runtime and the IDE is written in
Smalltalk. The program and the environment are not 2 separate things, they are
one. When you execute your program, it is just another “thread” in the same
environment that you are creating the program in. You can do bizarre things
like remapping <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> or redefining what addition means and the
entire system will reflect the change right away (to disastrous results!). The
fact that the IDE and the program share a language means that any Smalltalk
programmer can understand and extend the IDE itself. Would you like a menu with
your most commonly used commands? Sure, just use the inspector/debugger to find
out where the menus are defined and add an entry there. Boom!</p>

<p>This also offers the really powerful ability to customize the debugger for the
task at hand. <a href="http://kursjan.github.io/petitparser2/">PetitParser2</a> is
probably the best example of this. It is a parser-combinator library. As Aditya
demonstrates in his talk, when you build up a parser, the parser provides
several hooks into the Smalltalk debugger. It can show you the matches it has
built up so far(including negative matches!) and you can run various inputs
against the parser to understand behavior. So you can start with a very simple
parser and iteratively make it complicated, observing the parse tree and
getting the behavior you want.</p>

<p>Whereas a lot of AoC implementations on reddit used various regex and string
operations for parsing inputs, I’d lean to PetitParser for anything beyond
simple white-space delimited numbers. It was just so easy and straightforward.
Instead of having to find subtle bugs in string parsing, I could actually see a
domain specific debugging view as my parser encountered tokens.</p>

<p>You could similarly imagine having domain specific drawings for your project.
If I was writing a build system in Smalltalk, I would write a build graph
viewer, and instead of a <a href="https://graphviz.org/">static graphviz image</a>, it
could be very interactive. While the build was running, it could update the
graph with file modification times, or indicate whether it thinks a file needs
to be rebuilt, and then I could easily debug why a particular file wasn’t being
built.</p>

<p>The folks at <a href="https://feenk.com/">Feenk</a> are really leveraging this in their
<a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a> to fantastic effect! I highly
recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLZHVq_-2D2-iI4rA2O8Ug">their
videos</a>.</p>

<h2 id="minor">Minor</h2>

<p>I appreciated the built-in Array2D class for the various game-of-life
implementations as well as <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20">Jurassic
Jigsaw</a> where it was easy to reason in
terms of rows and columns, and quickly slice those out.  Similarly, the Point
class and special “syntax”<sup id="fnref:point"><a href="#fn:point">7</a></sup> made Day 12 <a href="https://github.com/nikhilm/AdventOfCode2020/blob/bbc331e2af2d948e683cade9ff4f93b4e4a3f667/AdventOfCode/AOCFerry.class.st">really
easy</a>.</p>



<p>Of course everything wasn’t magical. The Smalltalk/Pharo community is very
small, so this shouldn’t be considered a rant, just my disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>This was my biggest frustration. If we accept that <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">documentation has 4
distinct types</a>, Smalltalk does a great job
of Reference docs, because everything can easily be inspected and browsed, so
reading method documentation, while seeing its implementation is really easy.
You can also easily inspect what an object is at the point of use, and then see
what methods are available on it. However there is still plenty of scope for
improvement here, as not all non-trivial methods have docstrings. In addition,
for such a powerful IDE, the lack of documentation tooltips on hover is very
odd.</p>

<p>It really lags behind in the other categories. There is a wealth of great
content in <a href="http://books.pharo.org/">various free books</a> and the
<a href="http://mooc.pharo.org/">MOOC</a> that explains the language and getting around
the IDE. However all the books on various useful libraries are really out of
date. It isn’t fair to expect someone to …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>This is part of my <a href="http://stewiewrites.com/letters-to-my-20-year-old-self/">Letters To My 20-Year-Old Self</a>.</em></p>

<p>Every day, you see so many things you want. Books. Computer equipment.  Knick knacks. Ingredients for a new recipe. Materials for an outdoor project.  Used furniture bargains.  Random exercise equipment. So many garage sales—so little time!</p>

<p>Your natural impulse is to buy it all. Empty your bank account and embrace your heap of stuff.  And then get a bigger home to hold your horde. And then a storage unit.  Or two. Maybe three? Start with a 5x5 but graduate to 10x10.  And 10x20.  Then a warehouse in the industrial district.</p>

<p>You’ll need a truck to haul your stuff around.  A small pickup, at first. Then a full-size truck and flatbed trailer.  Eventually, you’ll buy a 26 foot used UHaul…</p>

<p>This. Is. Bonkers. Don’t go down this road. Or the stuff you own will own you.  Also, you’ll end up divorced, bankrupt, and miserable.</p>

<p>So what’s the alternative?</p>

<p>The obvious solution is to just not buy anything.  Cut up your credit cards and stash your debit card in a block of ice. But this isn’t reasonable.  You actually need some of what you buy.  And some purchases improve your quality of life.</p>

<p>But how do you suss out things you really need? How can you tell which bargains will boost your overall happiness?</p>

<p>The solution is to create a “Stuff I want” list.  Whenever you want something, add it to the list and wait 48 hours.  95% of the time, your interest in the item will fizzle. Some new must-have thing will capture your attention. And you’ll be better off because you didn’t shell out your hard-earned money for something you didn’t actually want.</p>

<p>Also, when you want something that costs $100 or more, wait seven days.  (I know, this feels like an eternity!)  But add expensive items to your 7-day list, and 90% of the time, your interest will wither away.  You can do this.</p>

<p>You cannot fathom how much money you will save! More money in the bank means more options and freedom to do what you want.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s dive deeper</strong></p>

<p>Growing up, no one ever told you the dirty little secret of a consumerist society: there’s always <em>more</em> to want, no matter what you have.  Craving never ceases.  So keep your cash and save it for things you really want in the long run.</p>

<p>People also never told you how limited your time is.  In your mind, there’s time to try all the recipes in those $5 French and Italian cookbooks you grabbed at a yardsale. There’s time to use all that exercise equipment, rebuild all those computers, and read all those classic novels.  But reality is another matter.  You have 16-waking hours each day and far less free time. You can’t do all the things you imagined doing.  Or even 10% of them.</p>

<p>Accept that your time is scarce—more scarce than money! You’ll let go of the notion that you can do everything.  Accept that opening the door to one hobby means shutting the door to ten others. You’ll let go of the feeling that you could do more or should do more.</p>

<p>This line of thinking, this perspective, will innoculate you against consumerism’s wiles. It creates a protective shield against the army of advertisements that blare, “Pleasure is just one purchase away.” This way of seeing the world transforms advertisements into mere distractions, like a cloud of gnats you swat away when it buzzes too close.</p>

<p>One last thing: don’t watch advertisements. Don’t let their bright colors, upbeat tempos, and attractive actors mesmerize you.  They seem benign, but they all have one purpose: to change your behavior. They’re not entertainment, and they’re not your friend.  Block them with browser AdBlock extensions. And watch TV shows without the ads.</p>

<p>This probably sounds extreme, but I urge you to try it out. You’ll see how ads, with their song of “You’re incomplete because you don’t have this!” is a monstrous weight on your soul.  Try it out, and you’ll discover peace and quiet within yourself.  Lastly, try it out and reclaim your emotional energy to pursue your short-term goals and long-term dreams.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>Rust is an incredible language. It is fast, strongly-typed, and its developer experience and community are some of the best. Rust is also one of the few languages that can compile to WebAssembly (WASM), which means we can write Rust code that runs in modern browsers! This opens up the possibility of a front end framework written in Rust.</p>
<h2>Why do we want a Rust front-end framework?</h2>
<p>A Rust front-end framework brings the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctness thanks to strong typing</li>
<li>Ability to share code with Rust backend</li>
<li>Performance (if done right)</li>
<li>Ability to run it in a separate thread/worker to prevent blocking the UI thread</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework could be platform agnostic, achieving the holy grail of "write once run anywhere" that Java so heavily touted in the 1990s. Personally, this is the biggest reason, as people spend countless hours rewriting UIs for a different platform.</p>
<p>There are disadvantages to a Rust front-end framework, mostly due to the limitations of WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a simple binary instruction format, so the file size tends to be bigger than JavaScript files, which means they take longer to download. Additionally, the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types">WebAssembly Interface Types specification</a> is not finalized, which means we can only communicate with JavaScript via binary at the moment.</p>
<h2>What makes a Rust front-end framework hard</h2>
<h3>Rust ownership and graphs</h3>
<p>Rust has a unique concept known as ownership, which allows safe concurrent code by ensuring that there is only one owner for a reference at any point in time. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html">Rust Book's explanation on ownership</a> goes much deeper into the subject.</p>
<p>As a result of this ownership constraint, data ownership structures in Rust are typically trees. Data structures like doubly-linked lists and graphs where there isn't a clear owner are much harder to write. They require the knowledge and usage of interior mutability or unsafe Rust.</p>
<p>Existing front-end frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seed-rs/seed">Seed</a> adopt <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">The Elm Architecture (TEA)</a>, which is a top-to-bottom, tree-like way of managing components and state. For those more familiar with JavaScript, TEA was the inspiration for Redux.</p>
<p>This tree-like structure is what Rust prefers, with the trade-off that the state must flow from the top-to-bottom. Each time, subtrees must diff the state to avoid re-rendering, which means that the state diffing logic takes O(log n) time. As the application grows bigger, state management becomes more cumbersome and less efficient. The more recent sentiment in the JavaScript community is that Redux should not be in charge of all states. TEA goes against this as there is no concept of local state.</p>
<p>If we want to achieve the most efficient O(1) way of diffing state, we would require a reactivity system similar to the ones used by Vue and Svelte. Unfortunately for us, reactivity systems are graphs. A reactivity system comprises of state and effects. Effects need references to state to do some computation, and state needs references to effects to inform them to re-compute.</p>
<p>This is the biggest hurdle. In order to introduce an ergonomic reactivity system, it seems we would need a special memory allocator, like a slab allocator with garbage collection to avoid Rust's ownership issues.</p>
<h3>Rust ergonomics</h3>
<p>Although Rust is an amazing language for many things, it does have some warts of its own. One of the most common parts of writing front-end code is passing down props to a child component. In Rust, there isn't a way to ignore optional properties.</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Component</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyButton</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Button</span> <span>{</span>
            textContent<span>:</span> <span>"Click Me"</span><span>,</span>
            style<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            class<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onClick<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onHover<span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            onBlur<span>:</span> <span>None</span>
            
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Due to this limitation, Rust libraries resort to either the builder pattern or macros. The builder pattern allows auto-completion but results in code bloat due to all the extra function definitions. Using macros, on the other hand, is terser but prevents auto-completion from working.</p>
<p>Another limitation is Rust's inability to share common properties between structs, deferring the responsibility to traits instead. While it works well for most programming, component-based architecture requires components to pass down properties to their child components.</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>ButtonProps</span> <span>{</span>
    name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    onClick<span>:</span> <span>OnClickHandler</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>ButtonContainer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>..</span><span>ButtonProps</span> 
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h3>Rust's code bloat</h3>
<p>While Rust is very well suited for system programming, its foray into embedded systems has only just started. As a result of earlier design choices, Rust has a rather big standard library.</p>
<p>When we try to compile Rust to WebAssembly file formats (.wasm), just the "hello world" example's size is in the tens of kilobytes. The most popular Rust front-end framework, Yew, results in wasm files that start from 300kB onwards. This may look acceptably small, but compared to JavaScript front-end libraries like <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> (17kB) and <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> (4kB), it is gigantic.</p>
<p>On the optimistic side, Rust is still a young language, and many of these code bloat issues are currently being tackled by the embedded working group:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/41">Panic handler binary size bloat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg/issues/18"><code>core::fmt</code> machinery optimized for size</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the issues that are preventing an easy-to-use Rust front-end framework from being written. However, the Rust and WebAssembly scenes are burgeoning, and given enough time, improvements will come. But don't wait, now is the perfect time to start learning Rust and WebAssembly before it becomes the next big thing!</p>

<p data-test-tag="@spp/ui-lead-text">Most countries in Europe have been hit much harder by the pandemic than Sweden, according to a recent compilation of excess mortality. But in the Nordic countries, Sweden is by far the highest. The pattern is reminiscent of previous pandemics.</p>
<p>– There are myths circulating that Sweden would be among the worst affected by covid-19 in Europe. That was true to some extent at the end of the first wave in May, and it seems to be the image that has stuck to the retina of many. But now you see that Sweden is one of the more mildly affected countries in Europe, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, historian at Stockholm University and author of the book “Corona – the pandemic of our time in a historical perspective”.</p>
<p>– About two thirds of the countries in Europe have a significantly higher excess mortality rate than Sweden. But in the Nordic region, Sweden is still by far the highest. So far, I must say, because the situation in Denmark is now deteriorating at the beginning of the year, he adds.</p>
<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Robust dimensions</h2>
<p>Excess mortality is calculated by comparing how many people have died during the year compared with the previous four years, and is one of the more accurate ways of examining how a society is affected by, for example, a pandemic. According to Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, it is a basic tool, as he analyzes the consequences of famine, plagues and other historical events.</p>
<p>– It is a robust measure, which makes it possible to compare different countries with similar demographics. Starting from the countries’ own reporting of infection and deaths in covid-19 is in principle meaningless, because testing and criteria vary so much. In addition, doing it week by week at the beginning of a pandemic is almost bland, as the situation changes drastically the longer the infection lasts. We already know this from pandemics, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>
<p>By compiling the latest available data on excess mortality in Europe in 2020, he has seen patterns that are largely reminiscent of how previous pandemics have affected Europe.</p>
<p>– A typical phenomenon is that the countries that are slightly affected during the first wave get a much harder blow during the next wave. Areas such as Central and Eastern Europe coped well with the first wave, but were hit hard during the second wave of autumn and winter. Now after the New Year, the pandemic has also hit Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia and Latvia hard, which were previously quite spared, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Nordic pattern</h2>
<p>Another interesting pattern can be seen in the Nordic countries, he points out. During the recent major outbreaks of disease – the Asian (1957), the Hong Kong flu (1968) and the severe flu in 1976 – Sweden, together with Denmark, has mostly been hit harder than Norway, Iceland and Finland. Nobody has been able to fully explain what this is due to. According to Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist, possible causes could be Sweden’s and Denmark’s much larger and cohesive urban areas and closer contact with the continent.</p>
<p>– Most say that Norway, Finland and Iceland will have the lowest death rates in the Nordic countries and in fact in all of Europe when the pandemic is over, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>
<p>TT: Could it not be that fewer people die from, for example, influenza and winter vomiting due to all the pandemic restrictions, so that the mortality rate in covid-19 is actually higher than the calculated excess mortality rate?</p>
<p>– Yes, it can be. But it is the same pattern in all European countries, so it does not matter for the comparison, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

<h2 data-test-tag="@spp/ui-subheading">Historical unusualness</h2>
<p>Severe pandemics have been a relatively common condition throughout history, affecting humanity at approximately 30-year intervals in recent centuries. Against this background, Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist thinks that it is actually a historical unusual that this pandemic lasted so long.</p>
<p>– There is a reason why many are so unprepared today. Our view of illness and death has also changed dramatically. We see it as something that can usually be avoided, so we are not used to so many people getting seriously ill or dying in a short time.</p>
<p>A seemingly paradoxical effect of all medical advances, he adds, is that even less serious viruses can have more severe consequences today, as the proportion of the elderly and vulnerable has increased sharply.</p>
<p>– It is basically something very positive. But it can also be more difficult for society to deal with such a disease, and the habit of pandemics can cause great anxiety and panic. Then it is easy to lose the holistic perspective, says Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist.</p>

There's dozens of different overlay network implementations that combine a stateful IPv4 address allocator with VXLAN as a transport layer. IPv4 overlay networks have a number of well-documented drawbacks, which contributes to Kubernetes' reputation as difficult to operate beyond small cluster sizes (~10,000 machines).</p><p>This page describes an overlay network based on stateless IPv6 tunnels, which have better reliability and scalability characteristics than stateful IPv4 overlays. It uses IETF protocols that are natively supported by the Linux kernel, and since it is independent of Kubernetes itself can support communcication between processes both inside and outside of containers.</p></div><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Wire protocol</h2><table><colgroup><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv4 header</th></tr><tr><th>0</th><td rowspan="2" colspan="4">(other IPv4 control fields)</td></tr><tr><th>4</th></tr><tr><th>8</th><td>TTL</td><td>IP protocol (UDP)</td><td colspan="2">IP checksum</td></tr><tr><th>12</th><td colspan="4">IPv4 source address</td></tr><tr><th>16</th><td colspan="4">IPv4 destination address</td></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">UDP header</th></tr><tr><th>20</th><td colspan="2">source port</td><td colspan="2">destination port (3544)</td></tr><tr><th>24</th><td colspan="2">UDP length</td><td colspan="2">UDP checksum</td></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv6 header</th></tr><tr><th>28</th><td rowspan="2" colspan="4">IPv6 control fields</td></tr><tr><th>32</th></tr><tr><th>36</th><td rowspan="4" colspan="4">IPv6 source address</td></tr><tr><th>40</th></tr><tr><th>44</th></tr><tr><th>48</th></tr><tr><th>52</th><td rowspan="4" colspan="4">IPv6 destination address</td></tr><tr><th>56</th></tr><tr><th>60</th></tr><tr><th>64</th></tr><tr><td></td><th colspan="4">IPv6 payload</th></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4">6to4</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056">RFC 3056</a>) is a standard for routing IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 network. It was originally designed as part of the IPv6 migration strategy, allowing isolated IPv6-only networks to use existing internet infrastructure. The protocol is extremely simple – the IPv6 packet is treated as an IPv4 payload, using protocol number 41.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling">Teredo</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380">RFC 4380</a>) extends 6to4 by adding a layer of UDP encapsulation, which can improve compatibility with intermediate network devices that have compatibility issues with non-TCP/UDP protocols. This page assumes use of Teredo, but if the underlying network allows 6to4 (protocol 41) then the UDP encap can be turned off to save 8 bytes per packet.</p><p>The Linux kernel has built-in support for creating 6to4 tunnels in the <tt>sit</tt> driver. Such tunnels can optionally use the Teredo protocol by enabling the <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/614348/">Foo Over UDP</a> (FOU) mode, which is a setting for Linux tunnel drivers that encapsulates packets in UDP. FOU computes synthetic source ports for outbound packets based on the encapsulated packet's connection tuple, thus allowing intermediate routers to distinguish underlying streams (e.g. for link aggregation or flow control).</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Pod address allocation</h2><p>The 6to4 wire protocol describes how to encapsulate IPv6 packets, but doesn't mandate how IPv6 addresses should be assigned or how a router should calculate the IPv4 address of the destination<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>. For that we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_rapid_deployment">6rd</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5969">RFC 5969</a>), which is a flexible embedding of the IPv4 address space into IPv6.</p><p>Allocating pod addresses with 6rd has a number of helpful properties:</p><ul><li>Given a pod's IPv6 address, its host's IPv4 address can be computed mechanically by the kernel. There is no userspace routing component.</li><li>Each host IPv4 address maps to a 64-bit IPv6 network prefix. Pod IPs can be allocated from this prefix by the CNI <tt>host-local</tt> IPAM plugin without any risk of conflict.</li><li>IPv6 addresses can be allocated from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_local_address">Unique Local Address</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193">RFC 4193</a>) range, which is similar to IPv4 private address ranges (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8).</li><li>A host's IPv4 address can have its high bits masked off, which is useful when every IPv4 address is being allocated from the same CIDR block (e.g. a private network).</li></ul><p>Unfortunately the 6rd functionality of iproute2 is not well documented, and the error messages are opaque netlink error codes. When in doubt, I recommend examining the iproute2 and Linux kernel source code to understand how <tt>ip tunnel 6rd</tt> commands map to netlink parameters.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Setting up a 6to4 overlay</h2><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Generate a network prefix</h3><p>To use a ULA range as a 6rd prefix, each IPv4 address must be masked to 16 bits or less. For this page I'll be using IPv4 addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8 range, which masks to 24 bits, so the ULA prefix needs to have its length fudged a bit (40 bits =&gt; 32).</p><blog-code syntax="commands"><pre>python3 -c 'import os; print("".join("%02x" % b for b in os.urandom(4)))'

				<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>My VLSI tools take a chip from conception through testing. Perhaps 500 lines of source code. Cadence, Mentor Graphics do the same, more or less. With how much source/object code?</span></span></span></span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em>– <a href="http://www.colorforth.com/1percent.html">Chuck Moore</a>, the inventor of Forth</em></p>
<p>This is a personal account of my experience implementing and using the Forth programming language and the stack machine architecture. "Implementing and using" – in that order, pretty much; a somewhat typical order, as will become apparent.</p>
<p>It will also become clear why, having defined the instruction set of a processor designed to run Forth that went into production, I don't consider myself a competent Forth programmer (now is the time to warn that my understanding of Forth is just that – my own understanding; wouldn't count on it too much.)</p>
<p>Why the epigraph about Chuck Moore's VLSI tools? Because Forth is very radical. Black Square kind of radical. An approach to programming seemingly leaving out most if not all of programming:</p>
<blockquote><p>…Forth does it differently. There is no syntax, no redundancy, no typing. There are no errors that can be detected. …there are no parentheses. No indentation. No hooks, no compatibility. …No files. No operating system.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://yosefk.com/img/n/black-square.jpg" alt="Black Square by Kazimir Malevich" width="220" height="218"></p>
<p>I've never been a huge fan of suprematism or modernism in general. However, a particular modernist can easily get my attention if he's a genius in a traditional sense, with superpowers. Say, he memorizes note sheets upon the first brief glance like Shostakovich did.</p>
<p>Now, I've seen chip design tools by the likes of Cadence and Mentor Graphics. Astronomically costly licenses. Geological run times. And nobody quite knows what they do. To me, VLSI tools in 500 lines qualify as a superpower, enough to grab my attention.</p>
<p>So, here goes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was intrigued with Forth ever since I read about it in Bruce Eckel's book on C++, a 198-something edition; he said there that "extensibility got a bad reputation due to languages like Forth, where a programmer could change everything and effectively create a programming language of his own". WANT!</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I looked for info on the net, which seemed somewhat scarce. An unusually looking language. Parameters and results passed implicitly on a stack. 2 3 + instead of 2+3. Case-insensitive. Nothing about the extensibility business though.</p>
<p>I thought of nothing better than to dive into the source of an implementation, <a title="Portable Forth in 'C'. Why do Forth programmers put C in quotes?" href="http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/">pForth</a> – and I didn't need anything better, as my mind was immediately blown away by the following passage right at the top of <a href="http://pforth.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fth/system.fth">system.fth</a>, the part of pForth implemented in Forth on top of the C interpreter:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>: (   41 word drop ; immediate
( That was the definition for the comment word. )
( Now we can add comments to what we are doing! )</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now. we. can. add. comments. to. what. we. are. doing.</p>
<p>What this does is define a word (Forth's name for a function) called "(". "(" is executed at compile time (as directed by IMMEDIATE). It tells the compiler to read bytes from the source file (that's what the word called, um, WORD is doing), until a ")" – ASCII 41 – is found. Those bytes are then ignored (the pointer to them is removed from the stack with DROP). So effectively, everything inside "( … )" becomes a comment.</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em> Yeah, you definitely can't do that in C++. (You <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/CLHS/Body/f_set_ma.htm#set-macro-character">can</a> in Lisp but they don't teach you those parts at school. They teach the pure functional parts, where you <em>can't</em> do things that you <em>can</em> in C++. Bastards.)</p>
<p>Read some more and…</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><em> conditional primitives</em>
: IF     <em>( -- f orig )</em>  ?comp compile 0branch  conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate
: THEN   <em>( f orig -- )</em>  swap ?condition  &gt;resolve   ; immediate
: BEGIN  <em>( -- f dest )</em>  ?comp conditional_key &lt;mark   ; immediate
: AGAIN  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile branch  swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: UNTIL  <em>( f dest -- )</em>  compile 0branch swap ?condition  &lt;resolve  ; immediate
: AHEAD  <em>( -- f orig )</em>  compile branch   conditional_key &gt;mark     ; immediate</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Conditional <em>primitives</em>?! Looks like conditional primitives aren't – they <em>define</em> them here. This COMPILE BRANCH business modifies the code of a function that uses IF or THEN, at compile time. THEN – one part of the conditional – writes (RESOLVEs) a branch offset to a point in code saved (MARKed) by IF, the other part of the conditional.</p>
<p>It's as if a conventional program modified the assembly instructions generated from it at compile time. What? How? Who? How do I wrap my mind around this?</p>
<p>Shocked, I read the source of pForth.</p>
<p>Sort of understood how Forth code was represented and interpreted. Code is this array of "execution tokens" – function pointers, numbers and a few built-ins like branches, basically. A Forth interpreter keeps an instruction pointer into this array (ip), a data stack (ds), and a return stack (rs), and does this:</p>
<pre><strong>while</strong>(<strong>true</strong>) {
 <strong>switch</strong>(*ip) {
  <em>//arithmetics (+,-,*...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>PLUS: ds.push(ds.pop() + ds.pop()); ++ip;
  <em>//stack manipulation (drop,swap,rot...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>DROP: ds.pop(); ++ip;
  <em>//literal numbers (1,2,3...):</em>
  <strong>case </strong>LITERAL: ds.push(ip[1]); ip+=2;
  <em>//control flow:</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>COND_BRANCH: <strong>if</strong>(!ds.pop()) ip+=ip[1]; <strong>else </strong>ip+=2;
 &nbsp;<strong>case </strong>RETURN: ip = rs.pop();
  <em>//user-defined words: save return address &amp; jump</em>
 &nbsp;<strong>default</strong>: rs.push(ip+1); ip = *ip;
 }
}</pre>
<p>That's it, pretty much. Similar, say, to the virtual stack machine used to implement Java. One difference is that compiling a Forth program is basically writing to the code array in a WYSIWYG fashion. COMPILE SOMETHING simply appends the address of the word SOMETHING to the end of the code array. So does plain SOMETHING when Forth is compiling rather than interpreting, as it is between a colon and a semicolon, that is, when a word is defined.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE 2DUP UP RIGHT DOWN LEFT ;</pre>
<p>simply appends {&amp;2dup,&amp;up,&amp;right,&amp;down,&amp;left,RETURN} to the code array. Very straightforward. There are no parameters or declaration/expression syntax as in…</p>
<pre><strong>void </strong>drawRectangle(<strong>int </strong>width, <strong>int </strong>height) {
  up(height);
  right(width);
  down(height);
  left(width);
}</pre>
<p>…to make it less than absolutely clear how the source code maps to executable code. "C maps straightforwardly to assembly"? Ha! <em>Forth</em> maps straightforwardly to assembly. Well, to the assembly language of a virtual stack machine, but still. So one can understand how self-modifying code like IF and THEN works.</p>
<p>On the other hand, compared to drawRectangle, it is somewhat unclear what DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>does</em>. What are those 2 values on the top of the stack that 2DUP duplicates before meaningful English names appear in DRAW-RECTANGLE's definition? This is supposed to be ameliorated by stack comments:</p>
<pre>: DRAW-RECTANGLE <em>( width height -- )</em> ... ;</pre>
<p>…tells us that DRAW-RECTANGLE expects to find height at the top of the stack, and width right below it.</p>
<p>I went on to sort of understand CREATE/DOES&gt; – a further extension of this compile-time self-modifying code business that you use to "define defining words" (say, CONSTANT, VARIABLE, or CLASS). The CREATE part says what should be done when words (say, class names) are defined by your new defining word. The DOES&gt; part says what should be done when those words are used. For example:</p>
<pre>: CONSTANT
  &nbsp;CREATE ,
  &nbsp;DOES&gt; @
;
<em>\ usage example:</em>
7 CONSTANT DAYS-IN-WEEK
DAYS-IN-WEEK 2 + . <em>\ should print 9</em></pre>
<p>CREATE means that every time CONSTANT is called, a name is read from the source file (similarly to what WORD would have done). Then a new word is created with that name (as a colon would have done). This word records the value of HERE – something like sbrk(0), a pointer past the last allocated data item. When the word is executed, it pushes the saved address onto the data stack, then calls the code after DOES&gt;. The code after CREATE can put some data after HERE, making it available later to the DOES&gt; part.</p>
<p>With CONSTANT, the CREATE part just saves its input (in our example, 7) – the comma word does this: *HERE++ = ds.pop(); The DOES&gt; part then fetches the saved number – the @ sign is the fetch word: ds.push( *ds.pop() );</p>
<p>CONSTANT works somewhat similarly to a class, CREATE defining its constructor and DOES&gt; its single method:</p>
<pre>class Constant
  def initialize(x) @x=x end
  def does() @x end
end
daysInWeek = Constant.new(7)
print daysInWeek.does() + 2</pre>
<p>…But it's much more compact on all levels.</p>
<p>Another example is defining C-like structs. Stripped down to their bare essentials (and in Forth things tend to be stripped down to their bare essentials), you can say that:</p>
<pre><strong>struct </strong>Rectangle {
  <strong>int </strong>width;
  <strong>int </strong>height;
};</pre>
<p>…simply gives 8 (the structure size) a new name Rectangle, and gives 0 and 4 (the members' offsets) new names, width and height. Here's <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Forth_Lesson_18">one way to implement structs in Forth</a>:</p>
<pre>struct
  cell field width
  cell field height
constant rectangle

<em>\ usage example:</em>
<em>\ here CREATE is used just for allocation</em>
create r1 rectangle allot <em>\ r1=HERE; HERE+=8</em>
2 r1 width !
3 r1 height !
: area dup width @ swap height @ * ;
r1 area . <em>\ should print 6</em></pre>
<p>CELL is the size of a word; we could say "4 field width" instead of "cell field width" on 32b machines. Here's the definition of FIELD:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;: field <em>( struct-size field-size -- new-struct-size )</em>
    create over , +
    does&gt; @ +
&nbsp;;</pre>
<p>Again, pretty compact. The CREATE part stores the offset, a.k.a current struct size (OVER does ds.push(ds[1]), comma does *HERE++=ds.pop()), then adds the field size to the struct size, updating it for the next call to FIELD. The DOES&gt; part fetches the offset, and adds it to the top of the stack, supposedly containing the object base pointer, so that "rect width" or "rect height" compute &amp;rect.width or &amp;rect.height, respectively. Then you can access this address with @ or ! (fetch/store). STRUCT simply pushes 0 to the top of the data stack (initial size value), and at the end, CONSTANT consumes the struct size:</p>
<pre>struct <em>\ data stack: 0</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 0 4 )</em> field width  <em>( ds: 4 )</em>
  cell <em>( ds: 4 4 )</em> field height <em>( ds: 8 )</em>
constant rectangle <em>( ds: as before STRUCT )</em></pre>
<p>You can further extend this to support polymorphic methods – METHOD would work similarly to FIELD, fetching a function pointer ("execution token") through a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

<p>The Huffman Coding algorithm is a building block of many compression algorithms, such as DEFLATE - which is used by the PNG image format and GZIP.</p>



<p>Have you ever wanted to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do we compress something, without losing any data?</li>
<li>Why do some things compress better than others?</li>
<li>How does GZIP work?</li>
</ul>



<p>Suppose we want to compress a string (Huffman coding can be used with any data, but strings makes good examples).</p>

<p>Inevitably, some characters will appear more often than others in the text to be compressed. Huffman Coding takes advantage of that fact, and encodes the text so that <strong>the most used characters take up less space than the less common ones</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="encoding-a-string">Encoding a string</h2>

<p>Let’s use Huffman Encoding to compress a (partial) quote from Yoda; “do or do not”.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/huffman-coding/yoda.png" alt="Yoda"></p>

<p>“do or do not” is 12 characters long. It has a few duplicate characters, so it should compress quite nicely.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, we’ll assume that storing each character takes 8 bits (Character Encoding is another topic entirely). This sentence would cost us 96 bits, but we can do better with Huffman coding!</p>

<p>We begin by building a tree structure. The most common characters in our data will be closer to the root of the tree, while the nodes furthest away from the root represent the less common characters.</p>

<p>Here’s the Huffman Tree for the string “do or do not”:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/huffman-coding/1.png" alt="Huffman Tree"></p>

<p>The most common characters in our string are ‘o’s (4 occurrences) and spaces (3 occurrences). Notice that the path to those characters is only two steps away from the root, compared to three for the least common character (’t’).</p>

<p>Now, instead of storing the character itself, we can store the <strong>path to the character</strong> instead.</p>

<p>We start at the root node and work our way down the tree towards the character we want to encode. We’ll store a <code>0</code> if we take the left-hand path, and a <code>1</code> if we take the right.</p>

<p>Here’s how we would encode the first character, <code>d</code>, using this tree:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/huffman-coding/2.png" alt="Huffman Tree encoding 'd'"></p>

<p>The end result is <code>1</code> <code>0</code> <code>0</code> - 3 bits instead of 8. That’s quite an improvement!</p>

<p>The entire encoded string looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/huffman-coding/3.png" alt="'do or do not' encoded using the tree"></p>



<p>This is 29 bits instead of 96, with no data loss. Great!</p>

<h2 id="decoding-our-string">Decoding our string</h2>

<p>To decode our text, we simply follow each <code>0</code> (left branch) or <code>1</code> (right branch) until we reach a character. We write that character down, and then start again from the top:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/huffman-coding/4.png" alt="Decoding using the tree'"></p>

<h2 id="sending-the-encoded-text">Sending the encoded text</h2>

<p>But wait.. when we send the encoded text to somebody else, don’t they need the tree too? Yes! <strong>The other side needs the same Huffman tree in order to decode the text correctly</strong>.</p>

<p>The simplest, but least efficient way, is to simply send the tree along with the compressed text.</p>

<p>We could also agree on a tree first, and both use that tree when encoding or decoding any string. That works OK when we can predict the distribution of characters ahead of time, and could build a relatively efficient tree without seeing the specific thing we’re encoding first (as we could with English text, for example).</p>

<p>Another option is to send just enough information to allow the other side to build the same tree as us (this is how GZIP works). We could send the total number of times that each character occurs, for example. We have to be careful though; <strong>there is more than one possible Huffman tree for the same block of text</strong>, so we have to make sure we both construct the tree in <em>exactly</em> the same way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The challenge of searching static websites is effectively a solved problem with brilliant, yet widely unadopted, solutions.</p>
<p>These projects scan and index your content at build time and ship it to the browser with the rest of your static files. No out-of-your-control external service required. A small library in JavaScript (sometimes accompanied by WebAssembly) loads the index and allows instant searching and works just fine offline. Searching the complete Federalist Papers for multiple keywords takes less than 100µs in my Wasm <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search">tech demo</a> (I’ll get to that later on).</p>
<p>The most popular libraries are written in JavaScript like <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/krisk/Fuse">Fuse</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch">FlexSearch</a>. They provide pre-compiled indexes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching">fuzzy</a>, wildcard, and boolean searches. They have good documentation and are ready for production usage.</p>
<p>But I’m more interested in how the up-and-coming Wasm-powered projects work. Browser search is a space where Wasm can really find an edge. Wasm runs faster, loads quicker, and ships smaller binaries (in theory, in practice it takes some work to get there).</p>
<p>The two projects I looked at both use Rust as a backend language:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch">tinysearch</a> generates a small, self-contained Wasm module (with an embedded index). It aims for a small memory footprint by using Bloom filters — a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that results in a negligible amount of false positives. Read more in <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch">A Tiny, Static, Full-Text Search Engine using Rust and WebAssembly</a> by the creator, Matthias Endler.</li>
<li><a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork</a> focuses more on the developer experience with rich documentation and examples. Stork also pays keen attention to the user experience by providing a progress bar for loading the index, excerpts for the results (keywords highlighted), theme support, and more (see <a href="https://stork-search.net/docs/interface">Embedding the Interface</a>). Learn about how it came to life in <a href="https://jameslittle.me/blog/2020/one-year-of-stork/">Stork Turns One: Building a search tool for static sites with Rust and WebAssembly</a> by the creator, James Little.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stork is more interesting to me because it focuses on the human experience — of the person who builds with it, and the person who searches. See the thin, quick, configurable UI below.</p>
<p><img src="https://healeycodes.com/bc9b4462651559eaacdb0d1bd4d4f766/stork.gif" alt="The Stork instant search in-action"></p>
<p>In order to understand how these search tools work, and the design problems involved, I built a technical demo in Go, compiled to Wasm.</p>
<h2 id="technical-demo"><a href="#technical-demo" aria-label="technical demo permalink"></a>Technical Demo</h2>
<p>My technical demo is inspired by Stork and uses a near-identical configuration file setup. So it had to be named after a bird 🐦 too — <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search">healeycodes/crane-search</a>.</p>
<p>Crane is two programs. The first program scans a group of documents and builds an efficient index. 1MB of text and metadata is turned into a 25KB index (14KB gzipped). The second program is a Wasm module that is sent to the browser along with a little bit of JavaScript glue code and the index. The result is an instant search engine that helps users find web pages as they type.</p>
<p>The full-text search engine is powered in part with code from Artem Krylysov’s blog post <a href="https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2020/07/28/lets-build-a-full-text-search-engine/">Let’s build a Full-Text Search engine</a>.</p>
<p>The core data-structure is an inverted index. It maps words to document IDs. This means we can check very quickly (i.e. 100µs within Wasm) which documents a word can be found in. At build time, we loop over the document files and add to the inverted index. We also create a list of results so we can relate a document ID to a document’s metadata (defined in the configuration file). The metadata includes the title and URL so that we can display a list of search results in the browser.</p>
<p>We can return results for multiple keywords by looking at the common document IDs for each keyword. This takes linear time as the IDs are inserted into the index in order.</p>
<p>During the build stage, we perform normalization to make the search engine more helpful and accurate. For example, if you search for <code>fish</code> you probably want to match <code>Fishing</code>. Words are turned into lowercase, common words are dropped, and words are reduced into their root form (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> — Krylysov’s example code uses <a href="https://github.com/kljensen/snowball">Snowball</a> as a stemmer).</p>
<p>The document <code>"Alice likes to go fishing"</code> becomes <code>["alice", "go", "fish"]</code>. The search term <code>"Fishing"</code> is also turned into a token, at search-time it becomes <code>"fish"</code>.</p>
<p>To handle the document metadata, Crane’s build program is passed the location of the configuration file. This tells it where to find the documents to index on disk, where they can be found on the static website, and what the search result should be titled.</p>

<p>The index and result data is combined into a single struct called a store. It’s encoded using <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/">encoding/gob</a>, a binary encoding that is faster and smaller than JSON (<a href="https://gist.github.com/evalphobia/a2ba2636acbc112f68dcd89e8b81d349">one</a>, <a href="http://ugorji.net/blog/benchmarking-serialization-in-go">two</a>).</p>

<p>The second part of Crane is the program that’s compiled into Wasm and sent to the browser. It uses the Go standard library package <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Package js gives access to the WebAssembly host environment when using the js/wasm architecture. Its API is based on JavaScript semantics.</p>

The Wasm module is loaded with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/instantiateStreaming">WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming</a> (<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/b2fcfc1a50fbd46556f7075f7f1fbf600b5c9e5d/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.html#L17-L22">polyfill available</a>) and is passed to the Go instance. The store is downloaded via the Fetch API and is passed to the running Wasm module where the gob-encoded binary is decoded.</p>
<p>I wrote a ~50 line <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/crane-search/blob/main/dist/crane.js">class</a> that abstracts away most of this to make the project easier for a developer to interact with.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> crane <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Crane</span><span>(</span><span>"crane.wasm"</span><span>,</span> <span>"federalist.crane"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>results<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result is, well, it’s no Stork. But it works and it’s fast. If there’s one way to get a developer to respect the complexity of your project, have them build a technical demo of it with 1/50th of the features.</p>

<p>The binary is too large at around 3MB (but I didn’t optimize for this). The solution for this is to read <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#reducing-the-size-of-wasm-files">Reducing the size of Wasm files</a> from the Go GitHub or read any of the blogs that come up when you search <code>shrink go wasm binary</code>. The best advice I found is to use <a href="https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo">TinyGo</a> to generate the Wasm (the “Hello world” example is 575 bytes) and to limit the number of libraries you include. TinyGo actually artificially limits the libraries that you can use because it implements a subset of Go — which means the encoding/gob package is out (encoding/json too).</p>
<h2 id="design-problems"><a href="#design-problems" aria-label="design problems permalink"></a>Design Problems</h2>
<p>If there’s one thing I learned, it’s that search is a reasonably solved problem. It’s easy to get started; stand on the shoulders of algorithms and away you go. The key problem in this space is the developer experience. Configuring the build process of a static site can be tricky when things beyond the standard content (e.g. posts, images) need to be generated. In order to return metadata about each result, these types of search tools require a config (usually TOML or JSON) and generating these files adds complexity.</p>
<p>Setting up a search bar with any features beyond the basics (e.g. auto-complete, full keyboard support, highlighted excerpts) is non-trivial too, especially when you want it to feel good and always react fast.</p>
<p>It’s also hard to build a solution that solves all use cases. Every time a feature is added (e.g. zero tolerance for false positives, fuzzy search, excerpts, partial matching) the index size grows by an order of magnitude. One rather esoteric idea that I toyed around with was building a search solution that split the index depending on the letters the user entered. Having an index for all the words that start with <code>a</code> and one for <code>b</code> and so on. However, English letter frequency is weighted towards things like <code>th</code> (see <a href="https://norvig.com/mayzner.html">English Letter Frequency Counts:
Mayzner Revisited</a>).</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of getting people to contribute to your project. Wasm is a reasonably young technology and building, testing, and debugging your code feels harder than it should be. Building a full-stack Wasm project always feels like it requires one-too-many steps. (For Go, it’s worth calling out <a href="https://github.com/agnivade/wasmbrowsertest">wasmbrowsertest</a> that automates in-browser testing.)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">Introduction to WebAssembly</a>, the best low-level introduction to the technology I’ve seen, Rasmus Andersson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The web is an amazing concept that is currently falling short carrying a heavy legacy from the past. In order to bring truly great experiences to the web and blur the lines of what is and what isn’t a “native” experience, WebAssembly—or something else like it—needs to happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A search tool for static sites is a good fit for Wasm, and I hope to see projects in this space continue to evolve. It’s a noble goal to build a project which actually has <strong>four</strong> design areas when you think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-end (build process)</li>
<li>Back-of-the-front-end (search algorithm/Wasm)</li>
<li>Front-of-the-front-end (results UI)</li>
<li>Developer integration …</li></ul></section></div>

<p>This article is about building actors with Tokio directly, without using any
actor libraries such as Actix. This turns out to be rather easy to do, however
there are some details you should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where to put the <code>tokio::spawn</code> call.</li>
<li>Struct with <code>run</code> method vs bare function.</li>
<li>Handles to the actor.</li>
<li>Backpressure and bounded channels.</li>
<li>Graceful shutdown.</li>
</ol>
<p>The techniques outlined in this article should work with any executor, but for
simplicity we will only talk about Tokio.  There is some overlap with the
<a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/spawning">spawning</a> and <a href="https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial/channels">channel chapters</a> from the Tokio tutorial, and I recommend also
reading those chapters.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Before we can talk about how to write an actor, we need to know what an actor
is. The basic idea behind an actor is to spawn a self-contained task that
performs some job independently of other parts of the program. Typically these
actors communicate with the rest of the program through the use of message
passing channels. Since each actor runs independently, programs designed using
them are naturally parallel.</p>
<p>A common use-case of actors is to assign the actor exclusive ownership of some
resource you want to share, and then let other tasks access this resource
indirectly by talking to the actor. For example, if you are implementing a chat
server, you may spawn a task for each connection, and a master task that routes
chat messages between the other tasks. This is useful because the master task
can avoid having to deal with network IO, and the connection tasks can focus
exclusively on dealing with network IO.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2>
<p>An actor is split into two parts: the task and the handle. The task is the
independently spawned Tokio task that actually performs the duties of the actor,
and the handle is a struct that allows you to communicate with the task.</p>
<p>Let's consider a simple actor. The actor internally stores a counter that is
used to obtain some sort of unique id. The basic structure of the actor would be
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use </span><span>tokio::sync::{oneshot, mpsc};

</span><span>struct </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>receiver</span><span>: mpsc::Receiver&lt;ActorMessage&gt;,
    </span><span>next_id</span><span>: </span><span>u32</span><span>,
}
</span><span>enum </span><span>ActorMessage {
    GetUniqueId {
        respond_to: oneshot::Sender&lt;</span><span>u32</span><span>&gt;,
    },
}

</span><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>receiver</span><span>: mpsc::Receiver&lt;ActorMessage&gt;) -&gt; </span><span>Self </span><span>{
        MyActor {
            receiver,
            next_id: </span><span>0</span><span>,
        }
    }
    </span><span>fn </span><span>handle_message</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>msg</span><span>: ActorMessage) {
        </span><span>match</span><span> msg {
            ActorMessage::GetUniqueId { respond_to } =&gt; {
                </span><span>self</span><span>.next_id += </span><span>1</span><span>;

                </span><span>// The `let _ =` ignores any errors when sending.
                //
                // This can happen if the `select!` macro is used
                // to cancel waiting for the response.
                </span><span>let </span><span>_ = respond_to.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.next_id);
            },
        }
    }
}

async </span><span>fn </span><span>run_my_actor</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>actor</span><span>: MyActor) {
    </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = actor.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
        actor.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the actor itself, we also need a handle to the actor. A handle
is an object that other pieces of code can use to talk to the actor, and is also
what keeps the actor alive.</p>
<p>The handle will look like this:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>derive</span><span>(Clone)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>MyActorHandle {
    </span><span>sender</span><span>: mpsc::Sender&lt;ActorMessage&gt;,
}

</span><span>impl </span><span>MyActorHandle {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>new</span><span>() -&gt; </span><span>Self </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(</span><span>8</span><span>);
        </span><span>let</span><span> actor = MyActor::new(receiver);
        tokio::spawn(</span><span>run_my_actor</span><span>(actor));

        </span><span>Self </span><span>{ sender }
    }

    </span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>get_unique_id</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>u32 </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(send, recv) = oneshot::channel();
        </span><span>let</span><span> msg = ActorMessage::GetUniqueId {
            respond_to: send,
        };

        </span><span>// Ignore send errors. If this send fails, so does the
        // recv.await below. There's no reason to check for the
        // same failure twice.
        </span><span>let </span><span>_ = </span><span>self</span><span>.sender.</span><span>send</span><span>(msg).await;
        recv.await.</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Actor task has been killed</span><span>")
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=1e60fb476843fb130db9034e8ead210c">full example</a></p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the different pieces in this example.</p>
<p><strong><code>ActorMessage.</code></strong> The <code>ActorMessage</code> enum defines the kind of messages we can
send to the actor. By using an enum, we can have many different message types,
and each message type can have its own set of arguments. We return a value to
the sender by using an <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/sync/oneshot/index.html"><code>oneshot</code></a> channel, which is a message passing channel
that allows sending exactly one message.</p>
<p>In the example above, we match on the enum inside a <code>handle_message</code> method on
the actor struct, but that isn't the only way to structure this. One could also
match on the enum in the <code>run_my_actor</code> function. Each branch in this match
could then call various methods such as <code>get_unique_id</code> on the actor object.</p>
<p><strong>Errors when sending messages.</strong> When dealing with channels, not all errors are
fatal.  Because of this, the example sometimes uses <code>let _ =</code> to ignore errors.
Generally a <code>send</code> operation on a channel fails if the receiver has been
dropped.</p>
<p>The first instance of this in our example is the line in the actor where we
respond to the message we were sent. This can happen if the receiver is no
longer interested in the result of the operation, e.g. the task might that sent
the message might have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>Shutdown of actor.</strong> We can detect when the actor should shut down by looking
at failures to receive messages. In our example, this happens in the following
while loop:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = actor.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
    actor.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>When all senders to the <code>receiver</code> have been dropped, we know that we will never
receive another message and can therefore shut down the actor. When this
happens, the call to <code>.recv()</code> returns <code>None</code>, and since it does not match the
pattern <code>Some(msg)</code>, the while loop exits and the function returns.</p>
<p><strong><code>#[derive(Clone)]</code></strong> The <code>MyActorHandle</code> struct derives the <code>Clone</code> trait. It
can do this because <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/sync/mpsc/index.html"><code>mpsc</code></a> means that it is a multiple-producer,
single-consumer channel. Since the channel allows multiple producers, we can
freely clone our handle to the actor, allowing us to talk to it from multiple
places.</p>
<h2 id="a-run-method-on-a-struct">A run method on a struct</h2>
<p>The example I gave above uses a top-level function that isn't defined on any
struct as the thing we spawn as a Tokio task, however many people find it more
natural to define a <code>run</code> method directly on the <code>MyActor</code> struct and spawn
that. This certainly works too, but the reason I give an example that uses a
top-level function is that it more naturally leads you towards the approach that
doesn't give you lots of lifetime issues.</p>
<p>To understand why, I have prepared an example of what people unfamiliar with the
pattern often come up with.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        tokio::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{
            </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = </span><span>self</span><span>.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
                </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
            }
        });
    }

    </span><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>get_unique_id</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>) -&gt; </span><span>u32 </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(send, recv) = oneshot::channel();
        </span><span>let</span><span> msg = ActorMessage::GetUniqueId {
            respond_to: send,
        };

        </span><span>// Ignore send errors. If this send fails, so does the
        // recv.await below. There's no reason to check for the
        // same failure twice.
        </span><span>let </span><span>_ = </span><span>self</span><span>.sender.</span><span>send</span><span>(msg).await;
        recv.await.</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>Actor task has been killed</span><span>")
    }
}

... and no separate MyActorHandle
</span></code></pre>
<p>The two sources of trouble in this example are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>tokio::spawn</code> call is inside <code>run</code>.</li>
<li>The actor and the handle are the same struct.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first issue causes problems because the <code>tokio::spawn</code> function requires the
argument to be <code>'static</code>. This means that the new task must own everything
inside it, which is a problem because the method borrows <code>self</code>, meaning that it
is not able to give away ownership of <code>self</code> to the new task.</p>
<p>The second issue causes problems because Rust enforces the single-ownership
principle. If you combine both the actor and the handle into a single struct,
you are (at least from the compiler's perspective) giving every handle access to
the fields owned by the actor's task. E.g. the <code>next_id</code> integer should be owned
only by the actor's task, and should not be directly accessible from any of the
handles.</p>
<p>That said, there is a version that works. By fixing the two above problems, you
end up with the following:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl </span><span>MyActor {
    async </span><span>fn </span><span>run</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        </span><span>while let </span><span>Some(msg) = </span><span>self</span><span>.receiver.</span><span>recv</span><span>().await {
            </span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>handle_message</span><span>(msg);
        }
    }
}

</span><span>impl </span><span>MyActorHandle {
    </span><span>pub fn </span><span>new</span><span>() -&gt; </span><span>Self </span><span>{
        </span><span>let </span><span>(sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel(</span><span>8</span><span>);
        </span><span>let</span><span> actor = MyActor::new(receiver);
        tokio::spawn(async </span><span>move </span><span>{ actor.</span><span>run</span><span>().await });

        </span><span>Self </span><span>{ sender }
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works identically to the top-level function. Note that, strictly speaking,
it is possible to write a version where the <code>tokio::spawn</code> is inside <code>run</code>, but
I don't recommend that approach.</p>
<h2 id="variations-on-the-theme">Variations on the theme</h2>
<p>The actor I used as an example in this article uses the request-response
paradigm for the messages, but you don't have to do it this way. In this section
I will give some inspiration to how you can change the idea.</p>
<h3 id="no-responses-to-messages">No responses to messages</h3>
<p>The example I used to introduce the concept includes a response to the messages
sent over a <code>oneshot</code> channel, but you don't always need a response at all. In
these cases there's nothing wrong with just not including the <code>oneshot</code> channel
in the message enum. When there's space in the channel, this will even allow you
to return from sending before the message has been processed.</p>
<p>You should still make sure to use a bounded channel so that the number of
messages waiting in the channel don't grow without bound. In some cases this
will mean that sending still needs to be an async function to handle the cases
where the <code>send</code> operation needs to wait for more space in the channel.</p>
<p>However there is an alternative to making <code>send</code> an async method. You can use
the <code>try_send</code> method, and handle sending failures by simply killing the actor.
This can be useful in cases where the actor is managing a <code>TcpStream</code>,</p></article></main></div></div>

	<p><small>January 27, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>I've been using Unix for long enough that 'find | xargs' is a reflex.
When I started and for a long time afterward, <code>xargs</code> was your only
choice for efficiently executing a command over a bunch of <code>find</code>
results. If you didn't want to run one <code>grep</code> or <code>rm</code> or whatever
per file (which was generally reasonably slow in those days), you
reached for '<code>find ... -print | xargs ...</code>'. There were <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/XargsTwoGotchas">some
gotchas in traditional <code>xargs</code> usage</a>, and one of
them was why GNU <code>xargs</code>, GNU <code>find</code>, and various other things start
growing options to use the null byte as an argument terminator
instead of <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/XargsTwoGotchas">the usual (and surprising) definition</a>.
Over time I adopted to these and soon was mostly using '<code>find ...
-print0 | xargs -0 ...</code>'.</p>

<p>For usage with <code>find</code>, all of this is unnecessary on a modern Unix
and has been for some time, because <code>find</code> folded this into itself.
Modern versions of <code>find</code> don't have just the traditional '<code>-exec</code>',
which runs one command per file, but also an augmented version of
it which aggregates the arguments together like <code>xargs</code> does. This
augmented version is used by ending the '-exec' with '+' instead
of ';', like so:</p>


<blockquote><pre>find . ... -exec grep -H whatever '{}' +
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(I'm giving <code>grep</code> the -H argument for reasons covered <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/GrepDevNull">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Although I sometimes still reflexively use 'find | xargs', more
and more I'm trying to use the simple form of just <code>find</code> with
this augmented -exec. My reflexes can learn new tricks, eventually.</p>

<p>This augmented form of -exec is in the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html">Single Unix Specification
for <code>find</code></a>, so
unsurprisingly it's not just in GNU Find but also <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/find.1">OpenBSD</a>, <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?find(1)">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://man.netbsd.org/find.1">NetBSD</a>, and <a href="https://illumos.org/man/1/find">Illumos</a>. I haven't tried to look up a
<code>find</code> manpage in whatever commercial Unixes are left (probably at
least macOS and AIX).
Based on the rationale section of <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html">the SUS <code>find</code></a>,
this very convenient <code>find</code> feature was introduced in System V R4.
The Single Unix Specification also explains why they didn't adopt
the arguably more Unixy option of '-print0' for null-terminated
output.</p>

<p>(In practice everyone has adopted -print0 as well, even OpenBSD and
Illumos. I assume without checking that they also all have '<code>xargs -0</code>',
because it doesn't make much sense to adopt one without the other.)</p>

<p>PS: Unfortunately this feature is not quite as flexible as it looks.
Both the specification and actual <code>find</code> implementations require
the '{}' to be at the end of the command, instead of anywhere in
it. This means you can't do something like 'find ... -exec mv {}
/some/dir +'. This makes life slightly simpler for <code>find</code>'s code
and probably only rarely matters for actual usage.</p>

<p><em>This post originally appeared on Seth’s blog.</em></p>



<p>Some of the most popular posts I’ve written over the past couple of years were the two that focused on just how rare outsized returns for an individual deal are in venture capital. You can see the original posts <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2019/09/the-markets-are-great-but-venture-outcomes-havent-changed-much.html">here</a>. In those posts I was analyzing data from Correlation Ventures that showed just how skewed venture returns are, specifically that <strong>65% of investment rounds fail to return 1x capital and only 4% return greater than 10x capital</strong>.</p>

<p>Ian Hathaway, who recently co-authored the second edition of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1119617650/ref=asc_df_1119617650/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459726176530&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9536524533228269419&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001941&amp;hvtargid=pla-930155281111&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a> with my partner, Brad, sent me the chart below, which highlights how that translates to returns in venture capital as an asset class. I’ve seen versions of this chart before, and while it’s not surprising it is always jarring to see it laid out like this. Specifically, the difference between the best performing and average performing firms are incredibly wide. Venture is a hits business and if you think about a typical venture fund of almost any size having somewhere between 25 – 40 investments, the chances of any one of those investments being a true outlier and returning a multiple of the fund are quite small. In order to have a successful fund, it’s almost a requirement that you have an outlier return for at least one of your investments (see below the chart for the math).</p>

<p>Some quick math highlights why this is the case. For example, assume a $100M fund with 30 investments. That’s a little over $3M per investment, and while there is some dispersion from the average across companies in a fund, it’s not a bad way to model it. But from the outcomes chart above (the first one) we know that on average only 1 (actually just fewer than 1) company in that group of 30 will return between 10x and 20x. And less than 1 will return 20x or greater (I’m using the company averages, the dollar averages are on a per round basis, which would make these numbers even worse). A 20x returner for a fund that on average invests $3-$3.5M in a company doesn’t return that fund. Taking the most aggressive end of these numbers would still only have this one company returning 70% of the fund’s capital. If you were going to have several of these, of course, that would work out for your fund. IRR will depend on the timing of cash flows but as a quick rule of thumb, venture funds look to return at least 3 times the invested capital – after fees, so more like 3.5x on a gross basis. That’s pretty hard to do without a true outlier return (50x+) and/or consistency of 10x+ returns that is simply hard to generate. And here’s where the dispersion comes in. The best funds do have multiple companies that return in that range. Or higher. But that means the median fund doesn’t have any. And that is why the average venture fund isn’t actually a particularly good investment and also why so many venture funds fail to return capital.</p>



<p>I thought about this a couple of years ago when <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2018/04/whats-the-optimal-portfolio-strategy-for-a-venture-fund.html">I wrote about the optimal venture fund strategy</a> and my conclusion was that venture firms should place more bets and have more exposure across a larger set of businesses. Obviously, those inside the industry argue that managers who are good at picking businesses would do better to own more of fewer businesses if they can show that they have the aptitude to invest in those that become true outliers. But given how rare they are, I wonder if that is arguably the optimal strategy. As David Cohen replied once years ago when I asked him what the key to being a successful venture capitalist was: “Luck”.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>You would think that starting or sustaining at anything is hard enough, right? But once you do start and once you do keep doing it, assuming that there’s an actual end to it, you’d expect it to be easy, no? Since you overcame the static friction and (hopefully) managed to do it for long enough to bring it to closure, finalizing the thing (whatever the thing is) should be a no brainer, right?</p>



<p>WRONG! </p>



<p>I can tell you, firsthand, that you are so damn wrong. Doubly so if you are somewhere high on the perfectionist spectrum.</p>



<p>Finishing a task, finalizing a project or wrapping up your bachelor thesis – they all come with specific set of issues. And this article is all about tackling them.</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>I finished all my exams and was discussing with my mentor which subject to tackle for my thesis work. Everything run by so fast and I just felt like I never gave my 100%. I did pretty good overall but I just felt like I never demonstrated my best. This was a time to make up for that.</p>



<p>“How much time do I actually have to submit this thesis?”. It was around late February.</p>



<p>“Well, the latest you have is by October, but I’d strongly suggest you to aim for June. No need to drag it any further than that”.</p>



<p>Almost eight months in worst case. Hell, even if I wrote half a page a day, I could tackle this in three months. EASILY.</p>



<p>Now, you have to understand that, by being a perfectionist and if you’re reading this – you probably are one, <span>you tend to categorize tasks in two categories — ULTRA IMPORTANT or NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL</span>. The latter ones are fine – you probably don’t need this article to have those tackled. But the ones that you categorize as ULTRA IMPORTANT, well hell’s bells, <span>unless you apply some tools of the trade, those tasks are doomed to last FOREVER</span>.</p>



<p>Needless to say in which category did my thesis end up, right? It was my personal work of art, expressed by letters being grouped into words. Every chapter would be a mind blowing one. Every comma had a pure holistic reasoning behind it. It was my terrestrial legacy to all of the readers and all future generations to come.</p>



<p>Two months and, I kid you not, all I had was a title. Well, a rather good one I should say – “Using audio-fingerprinting technique for the purpose of identification and categorization of an audio sample”. But still, it’s ALL I had in TWO months. And it wasn’t even written in a required format, but rather hanging in my notes app. At least it ticked all of my shitboxes – it sounded holistic and I’m sure the academia would fall over it’s butt once I released it to wilderness …</p>



<p>“Okay”, I thought, “at least I have a month to wrap it up. I can do two pages a day or so and I’ll be good to go”. What a dumb-ass thinking it was …</p>



<p>I’d like to say that it took me a month to finish, but that’d be a lie. It took me seven months and twenty eight days of randomly writing thoughts here and there, widening and narrowing down all the topics that I’d love to cover … And the clock was actively working against me. The paranoia started kicking in. Frankly, I probably would never even have finished it if it wasn’t for my professor who contacted me in late September to tell me that I have two days to deliver a finished and printed version. He loved the progress and he approved everything that I covered so far, but he needed it finished. F*ck!</p>



<p>Not only did I finish the whole thesis in 48 hours (I was literally writing the day and night; the only time when I wasn’t writing was during the 8 hours when I had work to attend to), but it turned out pretty good! Probably not how I envisioned it, but regardless. And I liked it.</p>



<p>Now, I would love to say that I learned my lesson here and that my master thesis took a different course. Not exactly. However, I’ve learned a trick – <span>I wrote the intro and conclusion before I wrote the middle part</span>. Combined with a fixed deadline, it actually did wonders. And I’ll elaborate on that now …</p>



<h2>The “Life’s Work” problem</h2>



<p>You know, I’m not exactly sure if this is just my problem or a rather generic one. I would bet on the latter.</p>



<p><span>Be it a thesis, a short-term task or a whole project that you are working on, we tend to believe that it just has to be perfect. Good enough is not good enough</span>. But, why so?</p>



<p>I can’t speak for everyone, but when it comes to me, I actually think that I’m afraid of being judged. Especially for something that I do care about. I’m afraid that someone is going to look at what I did and just be like “meh, it’s okay”, or “meh, it could have been better”. The sheer thought of that scares the living shit out of me.</p>



<p>Obviously, the only way of preventing someone from judging you (yes, YOU!) is to make it your life’s work. Pour all time and energy into it, trying to make it perfect.</p>



<p>And you know what’s the problem with “life’s work”? You either drop dead before you’re finished, or you give up on it. But one thing is guaranteed – they take shitload of time and you probably miss bunch of other opportunities in the process. Worst of all? <span>Once you do do finish (assuming that you do so), and once the initial excitement wears of, you realize that it wasn’t even that important in the first place</span>. It becomes yet another “meh, it’s okay” on your shelf. And you move on, determined not to repeat the same mistake again.</p>



<h2>Deadline as a medium of creative drive</h2>



<p>You know, I’m a programmer. And I’ve been so my whole life. And <span>if there is ONE thing that is guaranteed to trigger my vomit reflex it has to be the mention of a “deadline”</span>. Seriously.</p>



<p>Yet, <span>I would lie if I told you that there’s been anything remotely more efficient than having a fixed deadline</span>. The date when you have to have your project finished, or the date when you have to turn your homework or thesis in.</p>



<p>You would assume that NOT having a deadline is a proper way to fire up your creative juices, right? Because, putting a TIMELINE on a creative work beats the purpose of creativity, right? </p>



<p>Wrong. Partially, at least.</p>



<p>If you haven’t done so already, I’d strongly suggest you go and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=UIM1mGMSpj&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creativity, Inc</a>. It’s written by Ed Catmull, a guy who happens to be a brain behind 3D graphics and many of the Pixar’s cartoons. He also happens to be a President of Disney’s animation studio. </p>



<p>He argues that the deadlines are THE BEST way to bring your creativity to anything that is useful. Like, you know, a Toy Story for example. And how so? Well, by treating it as a medium, and not as a whip. You set a deadline for a check-up, but you don’t threaten people with being beaten if they miss it. You have people commit to deliver SOMETHING by the fixed date and then you decide how to proceed. Rinse &amp; repeat until it’s perfect!</p>



<p><span>But, what do you do if you DON’T have a fixed deadline (e.g. you’re working on your personal pet project, like, a blog post for example)? Well, you MAKE one</span>! And just to ensure that you do have actual stakeholders waiting for the “outcome”, you make a public commitment!</p>



<h2>Public Commitment as a viable alternative</h2>



<p>If you’ve been following my “work” on Instagram or LinkedIn, you probably have noticed that I usually publish a screenshot of the new article that I’m starting to work on. And you might have been wondering, and rightfully so, WHY am I doing that? What’s the purpose of publishing a screenshot of an unpublished article?</p>



<p>That is my public commitment! That is how I make an artificial deadline and how I make you a stakeholder. By publishing the screenshot, I’m passively announcing that I’m working on something new and that you should expect the final version soon. And there it is. My artificial 5-days deadline is set and my creative juices are on fire now!</p>



<p><span>So, in case that you want to work on ANYTHING that doesn’t have a strong deadline, go and make one</span>! If you’re about to embark on a diet – announce that you are planning to “lose X kilograms by …..”. If you’re working on a task, tell your boss that you will be finished by next week. Or, if you’re about to start blogging … well, announce it! Make your public commitment and then, the only thing that you’ll be left with is – having to do it 🙂 Because, you wouldn’t want to be a liar, wouldn’t you? 🙂</p>



<h2>Your turn!</h2>



<p>Whatever it is that you are working on (or planning to do), go and announce WHEN will it be finished! Make a PUBLIC COMMITMENT. Make artificial stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong>You don’t have to make it PUBLIC PUBLIC</strong> though. Sharing it with your inner circle, your family or, you know, your boss, is absolutely OK as well. <span>What’s important is that<strong> you commit to at least one person </strong>and that person has to keep you accountable</span>!</p>



<p>I guarantee that once you scratch the power that lies under the surface of public commitment, you’ll have hard time NOT finishing anything ever again!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Be it a task, a project, a thesis or a general goal that you want to achieve, putting end to what you started is as complex as starting and sustaining at it is. Combined with a “life’s work” problem where we tend to categorize things as ultimate expression of our creativity and skilfulness, we have a perfect recipe for a never-ending crusade.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to tackle this is a battle tested method of a deadline and commitment. Commit yourself either to your best friend or by announcing it publicly, and do make sure to create stakeholders and set expectations. This, in turn, will be one of the best driving forces both to keep you on track of what matters and to ensure that you are actually going to close.</p>



<p>Good luck and let me know how you did!</p>



<h2>Useful resources</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have that many resources directly related to the subject of “finishing” things. Hence, I will recommend some of the things that, among other things, tackle some of the topics that I wrote about:</p>



<ul><li>Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull – it’s not a self-help book but it deals with the topic of creativity and how Pixar achieved it. You’ll get to …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>I have a problem with this blog. It used to be powered by Wordpress, but the <bbr title="Content Management System">CMS pissed me off without end over the years, so I migrated to Hugo. That fixed a lot of the problems, except the main one: it is still (mostly) a Wordpress style blog, in which posts are fat content pieces of content, consisting of a  title and at least one paragraph of text. This is utterly unsuitable for things like posting status updates or sharing thoughts. Twitter does way better here, but it’s a proprietary platform, I’m not willing to bind myself to.</bbr></p>

<p>So, how about Mastodon then? Looks like Twitter, works like Twitter, but is federated and sadly, also a lost cause.</p>

<h2 id="the-thing-mastodon-gets-wrong">The thing, Mastodon gets wrong</h2>

<p>To me, it seems like Mastodon is trying to be a social network, while, ironically, completely failing to understand the network effect. It’s the right tool for the wrong people (or the wrong tool for the right people? I don’t know).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, what we want is a platform where you can have an intelligent conversation, where our privacy is respected and where we stay in control. But that’s not at all the audience, social media is build for. The ecosystem is entirely structured around all those gone gaga self promoters and would be celebrities that have nothing to contribute except “themselves” and are willing to sacrifice any last piece of dignity, if only it increases their following, so they have a number to show to their sponsors. The deal influencers enter is simple: bring in two new followers to the platform, get (an old) one for free. Keep any of the money, you may make from sponsors. Now go and post pictures of your lunch before (and after) you eat it.</p>

</p>
                             
                             

<p>And that in a nutshell is why Mastodon is going to fail: it simply is not build for the people who bring in other people, as it lacks any reward mechanism for multipliers. Social media is (and has to be) inherently anti-privacy in order to allow for monetizing “my personal life”. A commodity, available to everyone without any skill requirement to exploit, so there’s no shortage of dipshits, willing to take the deal. Most fail, but even in doing so, still promote the networks.</p>

<h2 id="quo-vadis">Quo vadis</h2>

<p>So, Mastodon has a choice. Either continue on the path of mimicking Twitter (without getting the crucial part right) and stay a niche product. Or (actively) attract marketeers, influencers and other attention whores, by promising them an audience while becoming a federated ad platform.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s not for me.</p>

Don’t be shy! I’m nice.</em></p><h3 id="why-did-i-create-this-guide">Why did I create this guide?</h3><p>I don’t know. It was fun? I’m weird.</p><h2 id="what-is-cryptoart">What is cryptoart?</h2><p>There’s no universally accepted definition of cryptoart. For now, let’s use this:</p><blockquote><p>Cryptoart is art that uses blockchain technology in its creation and/or distribution.</p></blockquote><h2 id="okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">Okay, so what is blockchain technology?</h2><p>Think of blockchains as giant spreadsheets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that can be viewed by anyone. I know: <em>Boooring!</em></p><p>But wait! These spreadsheets have ✨special rules✨.</p><ul><li><p>You’re not allowed to delete or change rows in the spreadsheet.</p></li><li><p>You can only add a new row after the last row. (Weird, right?)</p></li><li><p>When you add a row to the spreadsheet, a network of computers do a bunch of super complex math to confirm that what you added is okay. (Even weirder.)</p></li><li><p>If you try to sneak a change into the spreadsheet—like, I don’t know, give yourself a million bucks—that change will be rejected by the network.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p>Just like normal spreadsheets, blockchains are great for keeping track of transactions.</p><h3 id="um-transactions">Um… transactions?</h3><p>Yeah, you know: I give you something, you give me something in return. Transactions.</p><p>Blockchains store transactions in a way that is viewable by anyone but editable only under certain conditions.</p><p>(See the <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">special spreadsheet rules above</a>, in case you already forgot them.)</p><h2 id="what-are-nfts">What are NFTs?</h2><p>Now we’re getting to the juicy stuff. 🍋</p><p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. But what does that mean?</p><p><em>Don’t worry about it.</em> Seriously. Other guides try to explain fungibility, but I’m not going to. It’s boring and too technical for our purposes.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><p>The keyword to remember is <strong>token.</strong> We’ll come back to it in a minute.</p><p>For now, let’s <strong>think of NFTs as digital collectibles.</strong> In the real world, pretty much anything can be collectible, given the right conditions: stamps, books, Pokémon cards, spoons.</p><p>(No really, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Souvenir-Spoons/bn_7006309973" target="_blank">people collect spoons</a>.)</p><p>The same is true in the digital world. <strong>NFTs are a <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">blockchain technology</a></strong> that allow people to collect and trade just about anything, including… wait for it… <em>art.</em></p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/mona.jpg" alt="Modern Mona Lisa"><em>This terrible thing, which I created in five minutes, could totally be an NFT.</em></p><p>Theoretically, NFTs can be used for lots of other stuff, too: issuing movie tickets, selling video game items, or even proving ownership of real estate.</p><p>But let’s stay focused: we’re talking about digital art here.</p><h2 id="what-is-digital-art">What is “digital art”?</h2><p>Oh no, we’re not going down <em>that</em> rabbit hole.</p><p>You’ll have to define digital art for yourself. Whatever definition you have in your head is probably good enough for our purposes.</p><p>Let’s keep moving.</p><p>There are two basic steps to creating an NFT:</p><ol><li>Make a thing.</li><li>Tokenize the thing.</li></ol><h2 id="1-make-a-thing">1. Make a thing</h2><p>NFTs start as digital art (i.e. stuff you already know how to make):</p><ul><li>still images</li><li>GIFs</li><li>video loops (with or without audio)</li><li>music</li></ul><h3 id="what-about-physical-art-cant-i-turn-a-sculpture-or-a-painting-into-an-nft">“What about physical art? Can’t I turn a sculpture or a painting into an NFT?”</h3><p>Kind of. It’s trickier than you think. We’ll get to it in a second.</p><p>(If you really can’t wait, <a href="#creating-physical-objects">jump ahead</a>. But don’t get mad at me if you’re confused.)</p><h2 id="2-tokenize-the-thing">2. Tokenize the thing</h2><p>Remember <a href="#what-are-nfts">earlier</a> that we said NFTs are tokens? Follow along:</p><ul><li><p>For our purposes, think of a token as a digital link to something you’ve made.</p></li><li><p>Tokens live on blockchains, which we’ve <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">already established</a> are great for keeping track of transactions.</p></li><li><p>When you “tokenize” a digital artwork, you’re linking something you’ve made to a blockchain, which can be useful for proving ownership of that thing (among other things).</p></li></ul><h3 id="wait-there-are-_multiple_-blockchains">“Wait, there are <em>multiple</em> blockchains?”</h3><p>Oh yeah, there are loads of blockchains. You can even <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-blockchain-i" target="_blank">create your own</a>.</p><p>For NFTs, Ethereum is currently the most popular blockchain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><p>This is important: <strong>the token by itself is not cryptoart.</strong></p><p>The NFT (remember: T is for token) merely <em>points</em> to something else and says, “Hey, this thing and I are joined at the hip. We’re inseparable. Think of us as <strong>one</strong>.”</p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/nft-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the relationship between an NFT and a hosted digital image."><em>Token + media = cryptoart</em></p><h3 id="how-do-you-link-a-token-to-a-digital-thing">How do you link a token to a digital thing?</h3><p>Typically, you link a token to a digital thing you’ve made by attaching some extra information (metadata) to the NFT. That extra info includes a link to an image, video, GIF, song, etc. that’s hosted somewhere else.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><p>This arrangement begs a few questions:</p><ul><li>Where will the “official” digital asset be hosted?</li><li>How can collectors ensure that the asset won’t be changed by the artist?</li><li>What happens if the asset host goes down? Or disappears?</li></ul><p>There are solutions to these problems in the works,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and some of them get technical pretty fast<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. This topic goes beyond the introductory level, so let’s keep moving for now.</p><h2 id="understanding-ownership">Understanding “ownership”</h2><h4 id="if-the-nft-isnt-the-actual-image-animation-music-etc-that-i-created-cant-people-just-copy-my-artwork">“If the NFT isn’t the actual image, animation, music, etc. that I created, can’t people just copy my artwork?”</h4><p>Remember: <strong>The complete cryptoart is the token <em>and</em> the media you created.</strong> So they can copy your image or your GIF or whatever… but it doesn’t really matter.</p><p>Depending on how you see things, this is either great news or a big problem.</p><p><em>(By the way, the inherently copiable nature of digital art is the #1 thing I see NFT newbies struggling with—and for good reason. It’s confusing.)</em></p><h3 id="okay-lets-work-through-this-together">Okay, let’s work through this together.</h3><p>An NFT says that one specific copy of your digital media—the one listed in the NFT’s metadata—is the one that matters.</p><p><em>We discussed this above. If you missed it, <a href="#token--media--cryptoart">go back</a> and make sure you understand it before moving on.</em></p><p>So you could have literally millions of copies of your sweet CG teapot floating around the web, but the owner of your cryptoart only cares about the “official” copy linked to the NFT.</p><h4 id="im-sorry-but-thats-insane">“I’m sorry, but that’s insane.”</h4><p>At first blush, <em>I agree.</em> But let’s step back for a second.</p><p>For a few bucks, you can find and print a high-resolution copy of Cindy Sherman’s “Untitled #96.” Here’s a copy of it <em>right here:</em></p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/sherman.jpeg" alt="Cindy Sherman's 'Untitled #96'"><em>“Untitled #96” by Cindy Sherman (1981)</em></p><p>In 2011, a print of that photograph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_96" target="_blank">sold for $3.89 million USD during a Christie's auction</a>—setting a record for the most expensive photo ever sold (at that time).&nbsp;</p><p>Then, as now, people could easily reproduce the photo. Somehow, though, this didn’t stop the photo from selling for a boatload of cash.</p><h4 id="thats-different-people-were-buying-one-specific-print-of-the-photograph-one-created-by-the-artist-and-it-was-a-print-of-the-highest-quality">“That’s different. People were buying one specific print of the photograph, one created by the artist. And it was a print of the highest quality.”</h4><p>What if we broke into Cindy Sherman’s private studio, stole the original negative of the photograph, and then produced a print that was identical in quality to the one sold during the 2011 auction?</p><p>Would we be able to sell it for the same amount? Or more?</p><h4 id="no">“No.”</h4><p>Why not?</p><h4 id="it-wouldnt-be-official-it-wouldnt-be-from-the-artist">“It wouldn’t be official. It wouldn’t be from the artist.”</h4><p>Ah! Interesting. So we need to be able to trace the print back to the artist somehow?</p><h4 id="okay-i-see-where-youre-going-an-nft-traces-the-official-artwork-back-to-the-artist-and-the-blockchain-can-show-all-the-subsequent-owners-including-the-current-one">“Okay, I see where you’re going. An NFT traces the official artwork back to the artist, and the blockchain can show all the subsequent owners, including the current one.”</h4><p>Exactly.</p><h4 id="but-what-if-we-hung-our-copy-right-next-to-the-official-print-in-an-identical-frame">“But what if we hung our copy right next to the official print in an identical frame?”</h4><p>It wouldn’t matter.</p><h4 id="what-yes-it-would-you-wouldnt-be-able-to-tell-them-apart">“What?! Yes, it would! You wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.”</h4><p>The owner would know that the official version is the one in that <em>exact</em> spot on the wall, in that specific building.</p><p>It’s the same with NFTs: They point to a specific copy of a digital artwork “hanging” in a specific place on the internet.</p><h4 id="i-still-think-its-crazy-that-people-can-copy-my-images-that-devalues-the-art">“I still think it’s crazy that people can copy my images. That devalues the art!”</h4><p>Maybe. But it doesn’t <em>always</em> work that way.</p><p>I bet your mother or your uncle has a magnet on their refrigerator of one of Monet’s famous Water Lilies paintings.</p><p>Amazon currently returns nearly 800 items when you search for “Monet Water Lilies,” including neckties, mouse pads, and face masks.</p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/mask.jpeg" alt="Monet face mask"><em>A horrendous idea for a face mask. And yet, there it is.</em></p><p>Despite these countless copies, Monet’s Water Lilies paintings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Lilies_%28Monet_series%29#The_paintings_at_auction" target="_blank">routinely fetch tens of millions of dollars</a> at auctions.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the prevalence of reproductions in our culture has …</p></div></div>

        <p>The way the internet has evolved, at least how people search for information, is search engines.&nbsp; Most phones, which is what the majority of the world uses to browse the internet, like computers did back in the day, come preinstalled with browsers and search engines.&nbsp; Some even come installed with social networks.</p><p>Now this is in part by design and in part by the fact that it was the simplest solution at the time because it was the best.&nbsp; Take for example when google came out.&nbsp; All the other search engines, looked spamish, and generally their results where not too great.</p><p>Along comes google, giving you a new authority engine.&nbsp; Then out of no where there is a nice simple way to search for things on the internet instead of having to type in a domain and hope some one developed it.</p><p>This was awesome, and still probably is.&nbsp; But as more and more people started using the internet, also came the copious amount of volume that humans produce also needing to be indexed and ranked via authority. </p><p>This is generally helpful as most people trust the top search results now a days of most search engines.&nbsp; So how does this lead for social networks dominance.&nbsp; Well, let's assume that some one doesn't have FaceBook or similar.&nbsp; They get brand new access to a phone or something, and do a simple search.&nbsp; </p><p>Now FaceBook, Amazon, Harvard, all have authority.&nbsp; They are "trusted" sourced of content on the internet.&nbsp; There are of course others, but I'm trying to keep things simple. The only difference is Harvard does not have the entire world population able to post on it.<br></p><p>So by default if someone, qualified, or not, was to write something on FaceBook about a subject.&nbsp; Just by the amount of clout that FB has due to the number of other sites linking to it in the world, and the speed at which the site loads, on top of the fact that the parts that are exposed are also designed to be optimized for a search engine means that any new potential visitor is most likely going to land on that site.</p><p>So by therefor all new internet users end up visiting some of the major authorities on the internet that basically made it easier for humans to be able to post and publish things, ie becoming an indeterminate.&nbsp; </p><p>And since humans are far more creative in collective than any one human can be, by being the source of where people can publish things for sale, or thoughts, it by algorithmic process leads to the situation we are in.&nbsp; Of course there are ways to get around this, but that's not for today.<br></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have taken a couple terabytes of photos over the years, and have a mild phobia of deleting data, so I keep my photos on a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology DiskStation NAS</a>. I’ve got all the files on the thing:</p><ul><li>backed up to the cloud</li><li>encrypted,</li></ul><p>because back in 2016, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpgY9zAGbD/">apartment was broken into and thieves took all the electronics</a>. I’ve been slightly paranoid ever since.</p><p>The Synology NAS generally works pretty well, but the interface for decrypting a drive after booting is <em>extremely</em> painful. It’s about 10 clicks, a username, two different passwords, and a UI that is kinda wonky (it’s a desktop in a web browser)? Here’s a screengrab:</p><figure><video alt="Unlocking an encrypted drive in the Synology DiskStation UI" src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/decrypt.mp4" width="588" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><p>22 seconds is my personal speed record.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There are alternative solutions to this – you can set it up so that it <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_encrypt_and_decrypt_shared_folders_on_my_Synology_NAS#t4_1">reads the encryption key from a USB disk on startup, for example</a> – but, if I’m worried about the whole thing being stolen, it’s not a good idea to leave the encryption keys plugged into the thing, and it’s also not a nice UX to find and plug in a USB before turning the thing on.</p><p>This… seems kinda silly to me, and something that should be solvable with ✨ <em>technology</em> ✨. I’m only ever accessing this from one computer, for example, and every modern operating system has a good credential storage system (think <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac"><em>Keychain Access</em></a> on OSX or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0"><em>Credential Manager</em></a> on Windows 10). So, maybe my computer could take care of supplying encryption keys to the DiskStation!</p><p>I went looking for options, and discovered that the DiskStation Software has a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf">publicly-documented web API (pdf)</a>. At least, a <em>mostly</em> publicly documented web API – there’s no documentation for the methods to mount and unmount encrypted shares.</p><p>That web API is <em>also</em> used by the desktop software though! So it should theoretically be possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser devtools</a> to see exactly <em>what</em> is being sent to the DiskStation. 🤔</p><p>So, I clicked on all the right things in the Web UI, got to the bit where you type in the password, opened the devtools to the “Network Requests” tab, typed in <code>abc123</code> as my password, hit “send” and then watched for the requests:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/encryption-dot-cgi.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing a request to an ominously-named 'encryption.cgi'"><figcaption><p>hmmmmmmmmmmm</p></figcaption></figure><p>Hmmm, that <code>encryption.cgi</code> looks a little ominous. I wonder what’s in it?</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/public-key.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing huge blob of base16-encoded public-key"><figcaption><p>Yep, looks like encryption, alright</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, a public key. And then the web interface loads a spinner, and makes a request to <code>entry.cgi</code>. Let’s take a look at the contents of that request:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ciphertext.png" alt="A devtools screenshot, showing a jumbled blob of base64-encoded data with the phrases 'rsa' and 'aes' sprinkled throughout."><figcaption><p>HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so if we want to send a magic request to mount the encrypted share, it’s not going to be enough to supply the encryption password; we’re also going to need to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> supply it – how to <em>encrypt</em> the encryption password, so to speak.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-this-crypto-system">So, what is this crypto system?</h2><p>Right. Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>First, we fetch the <code>public_key</code> from the server. That’s the call to the <code>encryption.cgi</code> endpoint we saw earlier. This isn’t actually the entire public key, it’s only <em>part</em> of it. In fact, this is a 4096-bit integer, encoded in base-16. The <em>other</em> part of the public key is the number <code>0x10001 == 65537</code>, which is hardcoded into the JavaScript.</li><li>Then, we generate 501 bytes worth of random text from the charset <code>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-/</code> (that’s 77 different possible characters; I have no idea why this set was chosen though!).</li><li>We encrypt that random text using our public key. The encryption method is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2">RSA with PKCS1.5 padding</a>.</li><li>We MD5-hash that random text a bunch of times with an 8-byte salt. The end result of this is 48 bytes which certainly <em>look</em> pretty random to the naked eye.</li><li>We split those 48 bytes into two components – a 32-byte (== 256-bit) key, and a 16-byte initialisation vector.</li><li>Remember the password we typed in? Yeah, I’d forgotten about it too! But now, we <em>finally</em> take that password, and encrypt it with AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCSv7 padding, using the 256-bit key and 16-byte IV we derived in the previous step.</li><li>We bundle the RSA ciphertext, the 8-byte salt, and the AES ciphertext together and ship them across to the DiskStation.</li></ul><p>Still with me? It’s ok if that didn’t all make loads of sense yet; we’ll now go over the interesting bits more closely.</p><h3 id="symmetric--asymmetric-ciphers">Symmetric / Asymmetric Ciphers</h3><p>Fundamentally, we’re using two cryptographic algorithms in concert:</p><ul><li><strong>RSA</strong>: RSA is an <em>asymmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric cryptographic systems have two <em>keys</em> – a public key, which allows only for encryption of the data, and a private key, which allows for both encryption <em>and</em> decryption.</li><li><strong>AES</strong>: AES is a <em>symmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. In symmetric cryptography, all parties have the same key, and that key allows you to both encrypt and decrypt.</li></ul><p>It seems weird that we’re using both of these at the same time, right? But both systems have weaknesses, and mixing them together is an attempt at minimising the disadvantages of both schemes.</p><p>The problem with <em>symmetric</em> crypto systems by themselves is that you need a way to get that one key to every party that needs it. But you can’t just <em>send</em> it to them, because you don’t have a secure channel yet! Your options are:</p><ul><li>Share the key over a different trusted channel beforehand, or</li><li>have both parties derive the same shared key (from e.g. some partial data that they negotiate over the wire beforehand).</li></ul><p>Asymmetric crypto doesn’t have this problem – if you’re able to share a key that can only be used for encrypting and not for decrypting, then the decryption keys never have to leave the recipient machine. You can then encrypt some text, and nobody except for the recipient can decrypt it – not even you! Put it on the internet, write it on a banner attached to the back of a propeller plane – the message will only be readable by the intended recipient.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/your-ciphertext-here.jpg" alt="A propeller plane with a banner reading 'your ciphertext here'"></figure><p>Asymmetric cryptography is <em>slow</em>, though, so doing it for lots of data is going to really hurt performance.</p><p>A common solution is to simply <em>make up</em> a symmetric key, perform some symmetric encryption using that key, then encrypt <em>that</em> key using asymmetric cryptography, and deliver both to the remote party. Then, the remote party can:</p><ul><li>First, perform asymmetric decryption to obtain the symmetric key</li><li>Then, use that symmetric key to decrypt the rest.</li></ul><p>That’s what <em>this</em> particular system is doing. ✨</p><h3 id="a-quick-note-about-rsa">A quick note about RSA</h3><p>I don’t know much about how RSA works, but as part of researching this article I discovered that it’s pretty easy to implement badly, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">extremely difficult to implement well</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/rsa-correct.gif" alt="Two developers correctly implement RSA, 2010, colorised"><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwzHm6buB8">Two developers correctly implement RSA</a>, 2010, colorised</p></figcaption></figure><p>As software developers, we spend a lot of time shipping things once they get to a point of “it looks like it works”. <strong>You can’t take that approach with cryptography</strong>, and because everything is so opaque, it’s a lot easier to declare that your implementation works without realising that it’s missing fundamentals. Like correctness, for example.</p><h3 id="lets-talk-about-random-keyslets-talk-about-you-and-me">Let’s talk about random keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h3><p>Recall that this algorithm is generating 501 random bytes from a 77-character set, and encrypting that with RSA. 501 seemed like an oddly specific number to me; here’s the specific set of circumstances that characterise <em>why</em> we’re generating a string of this length.</p><p>RSA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"><em>block cipher</em></a>, which means it operates on distinct fixed-size blocks of input and produces fixed-size blocks of output. How big can each block be? Well, RSA public keys are made up of two numbers: a (very large) modulus <code>n</code>, and a much smaller exponent <code>e</code>. RSA is capable of encrypting any message that’s smaller than <code>n</code> if you convert it to a number. In our case, we said that our modulus was a seemingly-random 4096-bit integer – that means (approximately) that we can encrypt 512-byte blocks.</p><p>There’s an important implication here: if you don’t have enough input for a block, you need to fill it up somehow. Normally this is called a <em>padding scheme</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in block-based cryptography.</p><p>Now, the system on this NAS in particular uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2.1">PKCS1-v1.5 padding</a>, which prepends the message (before encryption) with 3 bytes of headers <em>plus</em> a minimum of 8 bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of random garbage. That makes 11 bytes out of a 512 byte block, which means we’ve got… 501 bytes left for our message. ✨</p><h3 id="lo-fi-key-derivation">Lo-fi key derivation</h3><p>So… we’ve got this 501-byte string, with each character being one of 77 possibilities, and we think we know <em>why</em> it was chosen to be 501 bytes long. But that’s not going to work for AES-encrypting the password:</p><ul><li>AES requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. That’s 16, 24, or 32 bytes respectively, but we’ve got <em>lots</em> more than that.</li><li>We can’t, however, just take a subset of bytes from the text and go from there – because they’re selected from a narrow subset of possible bytes (77 out of 255!), you’d be losing an <em>enormous</em> amount of entropy in the key, making the encrypted text about 44,000,000,000,000,000 times<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> easier to break.</li></ul><p>These constraints need to be managed. We can smooth over both by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a>, based on repeated rounds of MD5 hashing and concatenating. Hash algorithms, in general, are good for this because they map input data to… not random, but random-<em>looking</em> output data.</p><p>I like to think of hashing as “entropy laundering” – if you’ve got 256 bits of entropy in a 16kB file, taking the first 256 bits will give you only 64 bits of entropy. If you hash the whole 16kB file, then the entropy goes back up to the maximum of the entropy in the file and the entropy provided by the hash algorithm. This works because hash algorithms are designed to exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche effect</a>.</p><p>I do <em>not</em> have the tools or experience to evaluate whether this specific scheme is secure or not (this one seems esoteric, and the <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure">use of MD5 is scary</a>!)… so let’s move briskly on.</p><h3 id="aes-encryption">AES-encryption</h3><p>Finally, after a bunch of outdated and somewhat esoteric primitives, we’re back to something that is <em>good</em> and <em>works</em> and <em>only slightly</em> a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">loaded footgun</a> and is <em>still recommended for widespread use!</em> It’s AES with a 256-bit key.</p><p>AES is our symmetric cipher.

  <article>
    <p>At <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, we’ve been knee-deep in a substantial refactor of our system for running payrolls.</p>

<p>Running a payroll requires taking several different inputs such as how much an employee should get paid, where did they work, how much did they work, how much taxes should they pay, how much taxes have they paid this year, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>As a company that offers a payroll service, keeping this piece of the system in tip-top shape is important for the business. Customers love Gusto for its simplicity and speed when it comes to running payroll.</p>

<p>Over the years, this system grew beyond its original mandate. Rather than just serve payroll for one state, it now serves them for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although customers love our payroll, internally new engineers had a difficult time understanding the code and making changes safely. This system needed a tune up, so we embarked on a sizable refactor.</p>

<p>Because the process of calculating what you need for a payroll is one big formula, we set the goal of making this system “more functional” as in functional programming. We wanted to take the process of calculating a payroll and make it one big stateless operation.</p>

<p>The server-side code at Gusto is written in Ruby, a language usually known for its object-oriented and metaprogrammatic roots. Nonetheless, we wanted to integrate some more functional concepts into our code in the hopes of increasing the system’s safety and clarity. The result has been maintainable code that is easier to reason about and safer to change.</p>

<h2 id="embracing-the-pfaao">Embracing the PFaaO</h2>

<p>Ruby is an expressive language, but it does not lend itself to some common functional practices. Although Ruby allows for closures and first-class functions via <code>Proc</code>s, one does not see many <code>Proc</code>s passed around as objects in idiomatic Ruby.</p>

<p>Throughout our work, we discovered that you can create expressive interfaces with clean internals by embracing both OO and functional aspects of Ruby.</p>

<p>To do this, we used a pattern called <a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/ruby/pure-function-as-an-object-PFAAO-pattern/">Pure Function as an Object (PFaaO)</a>. Essentially, you design objects as you would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> but dress them up as Ruby classes.</p>

<p>A pure function is a function without observable side effects that always returns the same value for a given set of inputs. That means no talking to the database, no modifying the state of other objects, no accessing the system clock, etc. When we write a PFaaO in Ruby, we want to build an object that has no side effects.</p>

<p>A simple PFaaO might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>).</span><span>calculate</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@payroll</span> <span>=</span> <span>payroll</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>private_class_method</span> <span>:new</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>
    <span>PayrollResult</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
      <span>payroll: </span><span>payroll</span><span>,</span>
      <span>paystubs: </span><span>paystubs</span><span>,</span>
      <span>taxes: </span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span>
      <span>debits: </span><span>debits</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s quite a bit going on here, so let’s break it down bit by bit.</p>

<p>First, our class has only one effective public interface: <code>PayrollCalculator.calculate</code>. Because we’ve declared the constructor private using <code>private_class_method :new</code>, the instance method <code>#calculate</code> is effectively private.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This means that all of the other instance methods we declare are implicitly private, even though there is no explicit <code>private</code> block within this class. Because there’s no way to <code>.new</code> up an instance, there is not a vector to call any instance methods.</p>

<p>Our method only has one public interface and its designed operation is effectively stateless, therefore we only need to exercise one interface in our tests. Put some data in, assert that the data coming out is what we expected.</p>

<h2 id="referential-transparency-for-free">Referential Transparency for Free</h2>

<p>In our above example, let’s say that the process of calculating taxes is expensive from a time perspective.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we want to make a time/space tradeoff to consume more memory to minimize the number of times we need to compute taxes. In our example, calculating both <code>#paystubs</code> and <code>#debits</code> will require the result of <code>#taxes</code>.</p>

<p>Now because each of these private methods is a pure function, we have referential transparency. This means we can replace a method and its parameters with its return value. Think of it like algebra: Given the function <code>f(x) = x + 5</code>, you can safely replace any occurrence of <code>f(2)</code> with the value <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for a Rubyist? Free and safe memoization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
  <span>calculate_paystubs</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
  <span>calculate_debits</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>@taxes</span> <span>||=</span> <span>calculate_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Memoization is a form of caching, and can be fraught with issues if the memoized value does not actually come from a pure function. But because we make everything within the PFaaO pure, we can safely memoize this method call.</p>

<p>This is interesting because it looks like this class is no longer stateless: it now assigns local values. However the only interface is the single <code>.calculate</code> class method, each instance of our PFaaO is single-use. Any intermediate state can never be accessed by externally. Because this cached state is not observable externally, our function is still technically pure.</p>

<p>Much in the way a developer can abstract synchronous and asynchronous behavior, you can do the same with functional purity. Any local state changes are irrelevant in the lifecycle of the PFaaO. These local state changes are not observable from the outside world.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-pfaaos">Expanding PFaaOs</h2>

<p>As I’ve grown in my career, I have become less interested in how software is written but how it is maintained. Software maintenance is the blessing and the curse of any successful project: <em>Congratulations!</em> You have a business with lasting value. <em>Our condolences!</em> You must now pay for all of your mistakes. Nonetheless, it is always preferred to have a business that exists with technical debt, than to have a bankrupt company with a pristine code base.</p>

<p>PFaaOs in Ruby are great because they are easy to maintain. Not only are they easy to test, but they are predisposed to healthy growth.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Let’s again take the example of our <code>#taxes</code> method. Early in Gusto’s history (back when it was still known as ZenPayroll), we only offered payroll services in California. Thus, we only needed to worry about payroll taxes for California.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, California is a simple state when it comes to payroll taxes. Our taxes method might have looked like nothing more than the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say we expanded into a new state, New York. Now our method grows a little bit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we expand into every state,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> this method will grow to be quite large! Furthermore, each of these methods adds to the length of our <code>PayrollCalculator</code> class. Without constant gardening, the class could become difficult to understand.</p>

<p>But because each of our methods within a PFaaO is itself a pure function, we are able to extract classes as we see fit and make each one a new PFaaO. We can safely replace our growing methods with new PFaaOs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we tease apart these different PFaaOs, we also get a much better idea of the input requirements for these service classes. Our <code>@payroll</code> is a large parameter object, and each extracted PFaaO probably only needs a subset of its data.</p>

<p>So we can get away with something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span>
    <span>@payroll</span><span>.</span><span>only_pay_and_location_data</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we assume that the <code>Payroll#only_pay_and_location_data</code> returns a slice of the total data within the instance as a new <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Object</a>. This Value Object represents only the data required to calculate the taxes part of running a payroll.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-immutable-by-default">Data is Immutable by Default</h2>

<p>Another important ingredient for scalable PFaaOs is the requirement that all data be immutable by default. <em>This is a drastic change from how most folks traditionally write Ruby.</em></p>

<p>Every time you reach for your <code>=</code>, you’ll need to replace it with a <code>#set</code> or <code>#put</code>. Rather than modifying objects in place, you will get used to returning new copies with new values. (<a href="https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/">Hamster</a>, which provides great immutable data structures, can help you from having to hand-roll FP functionality.)</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rails? It will often mean creating functions or classes that take <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects and convert them into immutable value objects. For us, we carve out these value objects into the namespace of what we’re doing. For example, here are the two representations of a payroll in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/models/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># app/services/payroll_calculator/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator::Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ValueObject</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of a payroll represents the data that lives in the database. It is a superset of the data required for actually running a payroll. Although they have the same name, they do not have the same attributes. For example, the <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of <code>Payroll</code> will have a <code>processed_at</code> attribute, whereas the <code>Payroll</code> that lives in the calculation domain does not.</p>

<p>In the words of <a href="https://kellysutton.com/2017/06/07/domain-driven-design.html"><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></a>, each namespace here is a different Bounded Context. We implement adapters to take <code>ActiveRecord</code> payrolls and turn them into <code>PayrollCalculator</code> payrolls, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The upside of this is the same that you might see in any other large system with well-defined abstractions; changes in models don’t cross domains. In our example, we can change the structure of the <code>Payroll</code> in our database without needing to change the calculation code. We would only need to change our adapter. Furthermore, this context is entirely separate from the machinations of Rails. We could easily and safely pull this into its own …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks. I also caught the first wave of the e-ink revolution. Nothing beats a real book, in terms of textures and scents; but e-ink devices and the fantastic tools outlined here should make reading digital books much more palpable&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>I have been reading on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo%5FAura%5FHD">Kobo Aura HD</a> for almost a decade now, ever since its release. This means my setup is about as stable as its going to get in the near future. As good a time as any to collect my thoughts&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The focus is on e-ink devices and auxiliary tools; not on all digital content; so there are no mentions of syncing or reading on the go (with a phone) or of monitors which are good for reading on.</p><h3 id="the-content">The Content</h3><p>In general; my e-ink reading habits can be broadly broken into the following categories:</p><dl><dt>Light Reading</dt><dd>Practically this includes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami">anything I review on Goodreads</a>; these are not often re-read; nor read very deeply; since they are read for pleasure. They are however, rarely deleted</dd><dt>Required Reading</dt><dd>Anything which typically requires me to take notes or practice / write out proofs; these are most often considered to be either coursework (for someone somewhere) or research monographs. These are typically large (in size) and unwieldy (in that they often lack TOCs) and are read multiple times; with a focus on highlights and notes</dd><dt>Active Research</dt><dd>These are the most ephemeral of my reading habits; and also the most numerous; I do not typically store these on my e-reader; and rarely need to make notes on the reader&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. These are often tiny; but require special work due to the metadata involved</dd></dl><table><thead><tr><th>Content Type</th><th>Software Stack</th><th>Deletion Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Light Reading</td><td>Calibre</td><td>Rare</td></tr><tr><td>Required Reading</td><td>Calibre</td><td>Never</td></tr><tr><td>Active Research</td><td>Calibre + Zotero</td><td>Frequent</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Though I am a huge proponent of RSS feeds (with <a href="https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news%5Fflash%5Fgtk">Newsflash</a>) and read online content voraciously with both a <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> and <a href="https://www.diigo.com/user/rgoswami">Diigo</a> subscription<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>; I sincerely do not believe blog stuff or anything tailored for the web should have a presence on an e-ink device; so there shall be no mention of those parts of my reading habits<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p><h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2><p>My primary e-reader is still my <a href="https://www.kobo.com/koboaurahd?%5F%5F%5Fstore=au&amp;style=onestore">Kobo Aura HD</a> (complete with a snazzy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cover-Up-eReader-Natural-Cover-Function/dp/B00DZJ5VM0">hemp sleep-cover</a>), and has been my go to for almost a decade now since its release. Recently I have augmented my workflow with the <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">reMarkable 2</a>; though I have yet to break it in very well; mostly because I tend to gravitate towards typing out my thoughts&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> instead of writing.</p><p>The Kobo Aura HD is still the pinnacle of reading technology to me; mostly because the firmware is easy to bypass; and there is a vibrant community of developers on the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=210800">MobileRead Forums</a>. Display and spec aside; the biggest reason for never replacing it has been been the simple fact that most modern e-readers no longer support SD cards; and much of my workflow depends on storing insane amounts of material offline&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d393a91160884052b7717a31a565283336a03ccf/eb437/ox-hugo/2021-02-20_01-39-20_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 1: Primary reading device with Koreader"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Primary reading device with Koreader</p></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I never use Nickel (the default Kobo interface), and it would probably choke trying to scan my 200 GB of content; so I haven’t updated the firmware in forever.

These are covered in the order used.</p><h3 id="k2pdfopt">k2pdfopt</h3><p>The thought of reflowing text for an optimal reading experience, especially given the slightly limited processing power of my primary reading device is an enticing prospect. <a href="https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/">K2pdfopt or the Kindle 2 PDF Optimizer</a> is as criminally underrated as it is fantastic.
