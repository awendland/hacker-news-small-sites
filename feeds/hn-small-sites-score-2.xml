<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Today I implemented WebSocket support for 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	But, I soon came to realize that when implementing WebSockets from
	scratch that there is no go-to-and-know-everything resource
	available on the internet.
</p>
<p>
	Also, reading the RFC is kinda tedious, so I'm trying my best to
	have enough code demos available for clarifications. This guide
	tries to cover everything when it comes to the current WS13
	network protocol, including reserved frames and how to support
	them in future.
</p>
<p>
	Most people will most likely use socket.io, but from my personal
	view I wouldn't recommend it. In my use cases I use WebSockets
	peer-to-peer (yes, you can, despite everybody else claiming no),
	and the whole dependency tree of socket.io is rather redundant
	than performant.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides
	are implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>WS13</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a> 
	and that there were a couple of legacy versions of Web Browsers around
	for a while that implemented the websocket protocol in a buggy manner.
</p>
<p>
	This is not the case anymore and I will completely ignore your shitty
	Safari from the dark ages here (it's 2019, not 2011 after all).
</p>
<p>
	The Web-Socket Protocol is a web protocol that uses HTTP's 
	 <code>Upgrade</code>
	mechanism in order to upgrade a connection. That means the first request
	to the server is actually an HTTP request with the 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	and 
	 <code>Upgrade: websocket</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	If the server has a specialized service-oriented architecture that
	needs more than just websocket data frames in order to work, it is
	good to implement it as a so-called sub protocol.
</p>
<p>These subprotocols can be used in the Web Browser, too.</p>
<pre>// Browser Example
let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:12345', [
	'me-want-cookies' // Sub-Protocol
]);

let data = JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' });
let blob = new Uint8Array(8);

socket.send(data); // Text Frame
socket.send(blob); // Binary Frame
</pre>
<h2>Web-Socket Server</h2>
<p>The demo will be implemented in modern node.js.</p>
<p>
	The server creation has to be done with the 
	 <code>net.Server()</code>
	 interface,
	as the data that we need to access is 
	 <code>raw TCP data</code>
	 and our library
	will have to support binary encodings.
</p>
<p>
	It is important that the TCP connection is modified to fit our needs
	in order to never timeout. The WS13 protocol uses a 
	 <code>Ping Frame</code>
	 and
	a 
	 <code>Pong Frame</code>
	 which we have to manage ourselves, so we need to tell
	the TCP networking stack that by setting 
	 <code>socket.allowHalfOpen</code>
	 to 
	 <code>true</code>
	and by calling 
	 <code>socket.setTimeout(0)</code>
	 and 
	 <code>socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0)</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	As node.js runs 
	 <code>libuv</code>
	 in the background, which is of asynchronous
	nature, we also have to make sure that everything gets send as soon
	as possible by calling 
	 <code>socket.setNoDelay(true)</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs
import net    from 'net';
import { WS } from './WS.mjs';


// Chapter: Opening Handshake
const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};
	return headers;

};

let server = new net.Server({
	allowHalfOpen:  true,
	pauseOnConnect: true
});

server.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {

	socket.on('data', (buffer) =&gt; {

		let headers = parse_opening_handshake(buffer);
		if (
			headers['connection'] === 'Upgrade'
			&amp;&amp; headers['upgrade'] === 'websocket'
			&amp;&amp; headers['sec-websocket-protocol'] === 'me-want-cookies'
		) {

			WS.upgrade(socket, headers, (result) =&gt; {

				if (result === true) {

					console.log('WS.upgrade() successful.');

					socket.allowHalfOpen = true;
					socket.setTimeout(0);
					socket.setNoDelay(true);
					socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0);

					socket.removeAllListeners('timeout');
					socket.removeAllListeners('data');

					socket.on('data', buffer =&gt; {

						WS.receive(socket, buffer, request =&gt; {
							console.log('Received request ', request);
						});

					});

				} else {

					console.error('WS.upgrade() unsuccessful.');
					console.error('Sorry, no HTTP allowed either, yo');

					socket.end();

				}

			});

		} else {

			console.error('Sorry, no TCP allowed, yo');

			socket.end();

		}

	});

	socket.on('error',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('close',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('timeout', () =&gt; socket.close());

	socket.resume();

});

server.on('error', () =&gt; server.close());
server.on('close', () =&gt; (server = null));

server.listen(12345, null);
</pre>
<h2>Opening Handshake</h2>
<p>
	The initial request that is done via HTTP is conform to 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	,
	so it is very easy to parse and the payload is encoded in 
	 <code>utf8</code>
	and not 
	 <code>binary</code>
	, which eases up the parsing process.
</p>
<p>
	The headers are - as every network byte ordered data - separated
	by 
	 <code>\r\n</code>
	 after each line, which means it's best to simply parse
	line-by-line and just trim everything off to have margin for
	malformed but recoverable handshakes.
</p>
<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cookie.engineer
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: http://localhost:12345
Sec-WebSocket-Key: bm9tbm9tCg==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</pre>
<p>
	The header parsing mechanism for 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	 is quite easy,
	as it's just utf8 encoded data that has a trailing 
	 <code>\r\n\r\n</code>
	following its headers section.
</p>
<p>
	Fragmented frames always have this, but you never know what
	kind of script kiddie is challenging your server - so it's
	good to have a failsafe parsing mechanism in place.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs

const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};

	let req = buffer.toString('utf8');
	let raw = req.split('\n').map((line) =&gt; line.trim());

	if (raw[0].includes('HTTP/1.1')) {

		raw.slice(1).filter((line) =&gt; line.trim() !== '').forEach((line) =&gt; {

			let key = line.split(':')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
			let val = line.split(':').slice(1).join(':').trim();

			headers[key] = val;

		});

	}

	return headers;

};
</pre>
<h2>Connection Upgrade</h2>
<p>
	After the initial Opening Handshake request, it's expected to send
	the handshake verification back to the client.
</p>
<p>
	The handshake response contains the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</code>
	 header
	and the 
	 <code>Upgrade: WebSocket</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	 as well.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it is good to let the client know which protocol
	we are expecting (so that mismatches can be handled automatically)
	by sending the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies</code>
	 and
	the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the 
	 <code>nonce</code>
	 salt for the reply is static and is the
	utf8 value 
	 <code>258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// WS.mjs
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
import crypto     from 'crypto';



const WS = {};


WS.upgrade = (socket, headers, callback) =&gt; {

	headers  = headers instanceof Object    ? headers  : null;
	callback = callback instanceof Function ? callback : null;

	if (headers !== null) {

		let nonce = headers['sec-websocket-key'] || null;
		if (nonce !== null) {

			let hash   = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(nonce + '258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11').digest('hex');
			let accept = Buffer.from(hash, 'hex').toString('base64');
			let blob   = [];

			blob.push('HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake');
			blob.push('Upgrade: WebSocket');
			blob.push('Connection: Upgrade');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Accept: ' + accept);
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13');
			blob.push('');
			blob.push('');

			// XXX: Flags are used later
			socket._is_server = true;
			socket._is_client = false;

			socket.write(blob.join('\r\n'));

			if (callback !== null) {
				callback(true);
			}

			return true;

		}

	} else {

		if (callback !== null) {
			callback(false);
		}

		return false;

	}

};

WS.receive = (socket, buffer, callback) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Peer-To-Peer Web-Sockets
WS.ping = (socket) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Sending Web-Socket Frames

	Web-Socket Frames can be a bit complicated when just looking at
	the figure. Here's a bullet-point list of what to remember
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frames can be fragmented (because of TCP), so the first bit is the <code>fin</code> flag.</li>
	<li>The <code>rsv1</code> , <code>rsv2</code> and <code>rsv3</code> are Web-Socket Extension flags. If set to <code>1</code> , the payload can be processed differently.</li>
	<li>The <code>opcode</code> decides what kind of Web-Socket frame follows.</li>
	<li>The <code>client-to-server</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> decides whether or not the payload needs to be XOR-masked.</li>
	<li>The <code>masking key</code> is <code>32 bits</code> long (4 bytes). It is only transferred when <code>mask flag</code> is set to <code>1</code> .</li>
	<li>The <code>server-to-client</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> is always set to <code>0</code> and the data frame does not contain a masking key.</li>
	<li>Frames have a variable payload size. Payload length can …</li></ul></article></div>

					<p>Since release 0.9.0, a single service cluster can now monitor and audit multiple workload clusters. This allows organization to have one workload cluster per team, application or department — whatever suits their information security policies — but without incurring an increase in monitoring overhead.

					<p>To simplify compliance with access control policies, Compliant Kubernetes now includes support for propagating group claims from OpenID providers — such as Okta and Google — to Grafana, Harbor and the Kubernetes API. This allows your organization’s central roles to be mapped to various permissions. For example, when onboarding a new hire, you may add them to the “on-call operator” group in Okta, which will immediately give them access to various Grafana dashboards and <code>kubectl exec</code> permissions.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the owner of a kebab joint slap a <strong>massive, buzzing wasp </strong>with his <strong>bare hand</strong> directly into the grill whilst you pitch your new startup to him? If this also happens to you, <em>your business idea is not good</em>.</p>
<p>Many gurus online will tell you how to achieve success. I’m the opposite. Today I will instruct you on the noble art of achieving <strong>failure when creating a new software startup</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s right. Want to know a <strong>secret </strong>(it’s all about secrets today)? If you want to ensure your new startup fails, then please <strong>keep your idea secret so that nobody steals it</strong>. We learned this lesson the painful way.</p>
<p>But wait, who am I? I’m a guy that started creating software companies back in 2014 and failed a few times until I eventually succeeded. You can check my <a href="https://diego-os.com/about-me/" data-type="page" data-id="11">About Page</a> to learn more about me.</p>
<p>This post is part of a series where I share <strong>common pitfalls on starting a company</strong> – <em>and how to avoid them</em>. I’ve fallen for these traps before so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Also, I promise <strong>the wasp story is real</strong> and related to the topic. You will soon see…</p>
<h2>Coding in “stealth mode”</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story. The year was 2015, and I had a great cushy job right after graduation. I no longer had to eat <em>unbranded pasta</em> and <em>questionable ham sandwiches</em> every day, I was living the dream!</p>
<p>But then, I caught the sneaky <strong>startup bug</strong>. I thought, why work for someone else when I can <strong>follow my dreams</strong> and <strong>start a startup?</strong></p>
<p>I somehow happened to read somewhere that JustEat – the takeaway delivery company – was making <strong>a lot of money</strong>. Why not start something like that, but somehow “better”?</p>
<p>So, I read a couple of business books, I partnered up with someone, and we started coding in our spare time. In no time we had a prototype for our killer app… a JustEat clone… <em><strong>but with pictures of the food!</strong></em> Revolutionary!</p>
<p>Curious to learn what happened next? Did this epic tale of the underdogs following their dreams end up in massive success? Will the bards of the future sing about our heroic deeds? is wasp kebab any good?</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: Our fear of Bill Gates dropping from a helicopter into our “office” (a smelly bedroom) to snatch our “archives” (a battered notebook I bought in Poland for £0.20) didn’t materialize. Something else happened.</p>
<h2>But “I don’t want anyone to steal my ideas”</h2>
<p>So, we came up with a random idea for a food-related app, and called it <strong>Foodswiper </strong>– it was like Tinder, <em>but for food</em>. Then, we started coding for months <strong>in secret</strong>, without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, our idea was so valuable, so <em>irresistible</em>, that mentioning it would trigger all our friends to immediately ditch their jobs and families, and start coding to <strong>steal our idea</strong>. Even our moms were suspected of such intrigues.</p>
<p>I remember my flatmate throwing away post from the government directed at our company. He thought the address was wrong – I rescued the letter from the rubbish at night (of course in secret) and felt like <strong>James Bond</strong>.</p>
<p>So, why is all of this wrong?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, <strong>nobody is going to steal your ideas</strong>. The only ideas worth protecting are highly specialized academic research, military secrets, copyrightable material, etc. The obvious stuff that needs to be secret.</p>
<p>Secondly, keeping your idea secret prevents you from getting <strong>crucial feedback</strong> <strong>from customers</strong>, and getting customer feedback should be your goal when starting a new software product company.</p>
<p>In our case, with Foodswiper, we spent months coding the application up and when we finally came out to the real world to get some customers… we discovered that <strong>nobody wanted our app</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of pain and resources could have been saved if we tried to get our idea out there earlier instead of coding it up in secret for months.</p>
<h2>Why do people fall for this trap?</h2>
<p>I literally think the real reason people keep their ideas secret is <strong>fear of failure</strong>. Ironically, this fear of failure leads to failure itself!</p>
<p>People that want to start startups are often – but not always – accomplished individuals that have succeeded at many things in the past. <strong>When you have a good track record, you don’t want to sully it with failure.</strong></p>
<p>For example, in my case, I kind of had a very good trajectory. I graduated top of my class from Cambridge University, got a great job at Citi, and was succeeding at everything I cared about in life.</p>
<p>If you asked me back then why I kept my startup idea secret, I probably would have said <em>“so that nobody steals it”</em>, but the real reason was probably closer to fear of failure coupled with inexperience.</p>
<p>A startup is a big gamble. So many things can go wrong. It can be really painful to be “winning at life” for many years and then lose it all. <strong>All your fancy titles mean nothing</strong> when you start a startup. It’s all about results.</p>
<p>Some people invest all their money and get financially ruined after all, and plenty of really accomplished people have tried the startup game and failed. We all know some stories like these of have heard of them.</p>
<h2>The solution: limiting the downside</h2>
<p>At least I can proudly say we had <strong>some </strong>foresight back in the day. We acknowledged that we didn’t know many things so we engineered a situation where it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we failed.</p>
<p>Basically, we saved up all we could working in London. Then, we moved to a cheap country where our savings would last us around 2 years. This gave us <strong>plenty of time to learn</strong> (and eventually succeed with a different idea).</p>
<p>The backup plan was to come back to working as software developers for another company, and we were young and had no dependents, so the risk of total failure was mostly mitigated.</p>
<p>When you remove the risk of catastrophic ruin should your idea not work out, then you limit the fear and increase your chances of success.</p>
<h2>Gather customer feedback early</h2>
<p>I promised I would talk about the wasp. So picking up where I left off, we coded furiously for months, and then, we took to the streets of London to try to convince restaurant owners one by one to sign up for our app.</p>
<p>Did I mention this was <strong>after</strong> I quit my job to pursue that startup idea full time? i.e. <strong>dropping my income to zero</strong>. This was a depressing time. Nobody from any restaurant was interested at all.</p>
<p>Imagine a twenty-something year old, <em>inexplicably dressed in a suit,</em> entering your takeaway establishment and asking if you want to sign up for an app with <strong>no users</strong> that they have <strong>never heard of</strong>.</p>
<p>We basically visited hundreds of restaurants and nobody, <strong>zero people</strong>, were interested… until we got a signal from the heavens.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive search we finally found <em>one guy</em> that wanted to sign up for our app. To be fair, this man was really enthusiastic and wanted to help, I really appreciate people like this, but it was not meant to be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this just wouldn’t work. This is when the guy slapped the wasp into the grill. Needless to say you don’t want to see a dead wasp in your food. Also, too bad we needed millions of other people to also sign up.</p>
<p>There were so many insurmountable problems. If only the guy slapped me in the face that day, maybe that way I would have learned quicker.</p>
<p>We should have stopped the project then with the wasp incident, but we still stubbornly continued for 6 more months. For some reason we thought that restaurants were not interested because <strong>we lacked features!</strong> </p>
<p>It makes me cringe to think about those extra 6 months now. What we were lacking was <strong>customers</strong>, not <strong>features</strong>. We had <em>freaking </em>business cards! But not a single user.</p>
<p>We somehow convinced ourselves to continue writing code and features with no users! It’s insanity! We even <strong>made up</strong> some graphs with “projections” and automated billing systems for zero cash-flow. Ridiculous.</p>
<h2>Succeed with your idea instead of keeping it secret</h2>
<p>Instead of keeping your idea secret you should test it as soon as possible. Don’t fall for the same trap we did.</p>
<p>In our case, we eventually learned this lesson and stopped <em>Foodswiper</em>. We then tested 5 business ideas in just one month <strong>before</strong> coding them up. Out of those 5, one of them was <a href="https://nutriadmin.com/">https://nutriadmin.com</a>, which was successful.</p>
<p>We tested the ideas <strong>very quickly</strong> by creating a single one page mockup for each, and then placing ads, sending cold emails, and contacting prospects to ask if they would buy the product we were planning to build.</p>
<p>This allowed us to quickly discard 4 out of our 5 ideas (we didn’t find any interest for them for different reasons).</p>
<p>Moreover, when we found the app idea for nutritionists, the people we talked to gave us <strong>a list of the features they would need</strong>, and other key details that helped us succeed! Clearly this is a much better approach!</p>
<p>When we eventually launched our first (terrible) version of the software, we already had a couple of people in our list to try to sell it to. Even though we lacked features, some people paid for it and said they found it <strong>useful</strong>!</p>
<p>Over the years we have extended and grown this app to a much more professional product. But it all started with an idea and customer feedback. <strong>Crucially</strong>, it didn’t start with months of coding in secret.</p>
<p>I didn’t invent this “technique”, it’s broadly called <strong>customer development</strong>, and was popularized by Steve Blank in his book <em>The 4 steps to the epiphany</em> and later by his student Eric Ries in <em>The Lean Startup</em>. It works, confirmed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is serverless computing, and why is it taking the cloud computing world by storm? </p><p>These are some of the great questions that we are asked on a daily basis at Koyeb! While answering these questions, we will discuss some of the core concepts that are vital for newcomers and engineers looking to keep pace with emerging cloud computing technologies.</p><p>This blog post is the first in our Serverless Series about serverless computing. If you want to learn more about how serverless technologies is changing the application landscape, be sure to check out the next blog post in the Serverless Series: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://koyeb.com/blog/going-serverless-implications-benefits-and-challenges"><strong>Going Serverless: Implications, Benefits and Challenges</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#overview"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>In short, serverless computing means the fact of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely abstracted for the user.</p><p>Serverless is a significant evolution in cloud computing because users no longer have to manage the underlying infrastructure in order to scale their functions, containers, databases, and more; cloud service providers take care of this for them automatically and cost-effectively.</p><p>Above all, going serverless is a strategic decision with considerable benefits in the short and long term. Serverless is becoming the new standard to host modern and greenfield applications.</p><h2 id="quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing">Quick Refresher on the History of Cloud Computing<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="pre-cc-cloud-computing">Pre-CC (Cloud Computing)<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#pre-cc-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>At the dawn of the computing era, those who wanted to leverage computing technology needed to buy, install, maintain, and upgrade their own physical servers - a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor.</p><p>Even with their high-cost, computing technologies increased efficiency by orders of magnitude, so firms began to transition to the digital era. Still, building a computing infrastructure required massive amounts of upfront investment in the form of time, manpower, and money. Best practices included investing in large computing infrastructures that your firm would grow into and owning enough servers to handle the occasional spikes in activity. This capacity over-provisioning was really inefficient with expensive servers idling most of the time.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-emergence">Cloud Computing Emergence<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#cloud-computing-emergence"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Since the introduction of cloud computing in the mid-2000s, individuals and firms alike can outsource their computing infrastructures to cloud service providers (CSPs). CSPs provide and manage different levels of cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/aaS-graphic.png" alt="Managed Services"></p><p>IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are often represented as a pyramid as each of them provides a higher level of abstraction.</p><p>This outsourcing is a radical evolution in computing practices. Small and large companies alike can save incredible amounts of money, manpower, and time all while tailoring their computing infrastructures exactly to their needs and refocusing those resources back into their businesses.</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-serverless">The Rise of Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-rise-of-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term">Serverless is a Broad and Global Term<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless computing is an evolution of cloud computing. In short, serverless computing means the duty of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely removed for the user. </p><p>In fact, the word serverless only makes sense from the user's perspective because the user no longer has to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Servers are still very much in the picture as servers perform the computing operations, but there is a responsibility shift: they are now maintained and provisioned by the cloud service provider.</p><p>The term serverless started to be actively used in the industry for mainstream computing and web applications in 2015, after the launch of AWS Lambda, a serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform. Although FaaS is often associated with the serverless term, these two concepts should not be conflated. During the following years, a lot of other serverless services emerged, and the promise to reduce infrastructure complexity quickly enticed developers and companies.</p><h3 id="everything-serverless">Everything Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#everything-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Nearly all services can become serverless: compute, storage, database, messaging, and more. Indeed, there are already several different types of managed serverless services: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), and Database-as-a-service (DBaaS), just to name a few.</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/types-of-serverless-services.png" alt="Managed Serverless Services"></p><p>At its core, going serverless means outsourcing the work of managing your underlying infrastructure. It means no longer having to scale, operate, or update the servers that run your applications. Cloud service providers now handle these operations and offer them as a service.</p><h3 id="the-technologies-enabling-serverless">The Technologies enabling Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-technologies-enabling-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless technologies are possible thanks to a combination of several computer science advancements:</p><ul><li><strong>Containers:</strong> The rise of containerized resources with improvements in core Linux cgroups feature, hardware virtualization and the Docker/OCI are core enablers, allowing efficient virtualization and abstraction of physical resources.</li><li><strong>Ability to host arbitrary code:</strong> The ability to securely host any code with isolation thanks to virtualization progress is essential to allow mainstream serverless.</li><li><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong> The increase in network bandwidth and reduction of network latency has enabled wider distributed computing adoption, which is essential to provide variable amounts of computing power, above the limits of a single physical server.</li><li><strong>Versioning, naming and discovery:</strong> The last decade has seen significant progress in continuous deployment technologies with improvements in versioning and service discovery tooling, increasing the capacity to deploy in a distributed environment.</li><li><strong>Events and message passing:</strong> Event-driven architectures are a significant enabler for serverless as tasks can easily be distributed and processing power can grow as requests come.</li><li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Creating small, specialized services is essential to provide the right amount of resources for each processing function.</li><li><strong>Autoscaling:</strong> Finally, autoscaling is a core component of serverless, which has itself been made possible by strong advancements in load-balancing and monitoring technologies.</li></ul><p>The AtLarge Research Team provides a good overview of the technological evolution that lead to serverless in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/serverless-history-now-future18ieeeic.pdf"><em>Serverless is More: From PaaS to Present Computing</em></a>, give it a read if you want to dive deeper!</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#further-reading"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>We hope you enjoyed this short retrospective on the history of cloud computing and serverless.

And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How much time went into preparing the iPhone demo?</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.&nbsp;</p><p>I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!&nbsp;</p><p>With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections. </p><p>So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic.&nbsp;The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Amazing!

<p>This is the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, II) discussion of the idea of a ‘universal warrior’ – the assumption that there is a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of fundamental truth for understanding war, either in the past or present, or else a useful blueprint for current life more generally.  In investigating this question, we are using Steven Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">recent video series</a> as our foil, since it is a more completely explained expression of this idea and one should always try to debate the stronger form of the opposing argument.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">Last time we took a look at the social place of people involved in war</a>.  We found that, far from there being a universal combatant, distinctions between soldiers and warriors are both significant for the present and important for understanding the past.  Moreover, beyond that simple dichotomy, the idea of a universal war experience in turn conceals the basic fact that many people who were neither warriors nor soldiers, not properly combatants of any kind, experienced war in unique ways, be they victims of warfare, homefront supporters, or economically invested in the enterprise.  Already we have seen that there’s far more than just one sort of person <em>with</em> a war experience.</p>



<p>This week (and next), we’re narrowing our focus just to the combatants and asking to what degree is even the experience of combat and soldiering (or ‘warrioring’) common.  Does it evoke the same emotions or require the same kinds of character?  Is it conditioned on the same values?  Does it involve the same activities or experiences?  Is combat understood the same, from one society to another?</p>



<p>Even so narrowed, our topic is necessarily massive, since we are considering the experience of <em>all</em> wars at <em>all</em> times.  But fortunately (for the wear and tear on my keyboard, if nothing else) our thesis – that there are quite a lot of broad universals in the war experience – does not need to be tested <em>everywhere</em> if it can be shown to fail in many places.  Consequently, we are going to bounce around a bit here; I hope the reader will understand that I mean these examples to be broadly representative, rather than exhaustive.</p>



<p>If that method seems a bit patchwork, it is important to remember just how <em>expansive</em> the argument implied by this notion of a ‘universal’ warrior or war experience is.  <strong>In arguing for a ‘warrior archetype’ that recurs in all cultures</strong> (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-eight/">as Steven Pressfield does</a>),<strong> or more obliquely in arguing that some given sort of long vanished ‘warrior culture’ </strong>(like the Spartans) <strong>provides material for emulation today, they are making a claim for a <em>human universal</em>, and a profound one at that</strong>.  After all, the suggestion is not that, for instance, some particular Spartan (or knightly, or Viking, or Samurai, or Apache, or…) tactic or weapon should today be used, but that the <em>ethos</em> and worldview of those ‘warriors’ is valuable because it taps into a true human <em>constant</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Because after all, a lot has changed!</strong>  We no longer fight with spears, or muskets.  Our wars are, in some obvious ways, vastly different from the conflicts of the past.  <strong>Yet for these past values, social systems, or habits to be directly applicable to the present, <em>something</em> would have to be fundamentally constant, at a deep and fairly profound level, in human conflict</strong>.  And it has to be something rather more than ‘people die in war, and that is sad for some people.’  After all, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html">people die in logging</a>, and you don’t hear all of these fellows waxing lyrical about the ‘universal lumberjack’ (though I can assure you, if it does exist well…<a href="https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM">then he’s a lumberjack and he’s ok</a>).  It has to be something more than ‘war is scary’ because after all so too is running <em>into </em>burning buildings, but we’re not discussing patterning our lives around the ‘universal firefighter’ either.  There would have to be some more profound truth to the phrase – to abuse the <em>Fallout</em> series – that ‘War, war never changes.’</p>



<p>And that is a thesis we can test!  Does war change from one culture to the next?  From one period to the next?  From one place to the next?  Let’s find out!</p>

<h2>Raids and Battles</h2>



<p>So what is the experience of combat like?  Well, first we have to ask, <em>what sort of combat do you mean?</em></p>



<p>As I’ve noted before, the branch of military history most focused on the experience of combat is what is sometimes called the ‘Face of Battle’ school, after John Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle</em> (1976).  Taking three battles from English history (Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme), Keegan aimed to reconstruct the experience of those battles in its own long chapter, beginning with the campaign that led to them, then discussing the interaction of men and weapons (infantry vs. cavalry, cavalry vs. cavalry and so on) seeking to use the physics of the battlefield to explain how these interactions would go.  He then focuses on how men cohered in the face of terror; then on to the casualties and the aftermath.</p>



<p>We might imagine that this standard order (replicated, I might add, in <em>The Western Way of War </em>(1989), albeit with more problems of evidence) implies a standard sequence of events, moments and emotions in a battle.</p>



<p>Except that for most of the human experience, this sort of battle was rare and generally indecisive when it did happen (a point which leads to the marvelous title of the upcoming, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Face-Battle-Forgotten-Experience/dp/0190920645">The Other Face of Battle</a></em>).  This ‘Face of Battle’ kind of war – formally constituted field armies meeting in set-piece battles out on open fields, with a clearly defined ‘peace’ before and after the war, along with a zone of conflict and a ‘home front’ – is the kind of war modern folks tend to be quickest to imagine, because in most of the industrialized world, we imagine this as <em>our</em> way of war.  But it not the oldest, or most common, or original way of war.</p>



<p>The oldest way of war was what Native North Americans called – evocatively – the ‘cutting off’ way of war (a phrase I am borrowing from W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America” in <em>Empires and Indigines</em>, ed. W. Lee (2011)), but which was common among non-state peoples <em>everywhere</em> in the world for the vast stretch of human history (and one may easily argue much of modern insurgency and terrorism is merely this same toolkit, updated with modern weapons).  <a href="https://youtu.be/4I8kic8xZh8">The goal of such warfare was not to subjugate a population but to drive them off, forcing them to vacate resource-rich land which could then be exploited by your group</a>.  To do this, you wanted to inflict maximum damage (casualties inflicted, animals rustled, goods stolen, people captured) at minimum risk, until the lopsided balance of pain you inflicted forced the enemy to simply move away from you to get out of your operational range.</p>



<p>The main tool of this form of warfare (detailed more extensively in A. Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) and L. Keeley, <em>War Before Civilization</em> (1996)) was the raid.  Rather than announcing your movements, a war party would attempt to advance into enemy territory in secret, hoping (in the best case) to catch an enemy village or camp unawares (typically by night) so that the population could be killed or captured (<em>mostly</em> killed; these are mostly non-specialized societies with limited ability to incorporate large numbers of subjugated captives) safely.  Then you <em>quickly</em> get out of enemy territory before villages or camps allied to your target can retaliate.  If you detected an incoming raid, you might rally up <em>your</em> allied villages or camps and ambush the ambusher in an equally lopsided engagement.</p>



<p>Only rarely in this did a <em>battle</em> result – typically when both the surprise of the raid and the surprise of the counter-raid ambush failed.  At that point, with the chance for surprise utterly lost, both sides might line up and exchange missile fire (arrows, javelins) at fairly long range.  Casualties in these battles were generally very low – instead the battle served both as a display of valor and a signal of resolve by both sides to continue the conflict.  That isn’t to say these wars were bloodless – indeed the overall level of military mortality was much <em>higher</em> than in ‘pitched battle’ cultures, but the killing was done almost entirely in the ambush and the raid.</p>



<p><strong>We may call this the first system of war.</strong>  It is the oldest, but as noted above, never entirely goes away.  We tend to call this style ‘asymmetric’ or ‘unconventional’ war, but it is the <em>most</em> conventional war – it was the first convention, after all.  It is also sometimes denigrated as primitive, but should not be judged so quickly – first system armies have managed to frustrate far stronger opponents when terrain and politics were favorable.</p>

<p>What changed?  Very briefly, agriculture, cities and the state.  Agriculture created a stationary population that both wouldn’t move but which could also be dominated, subjugated and have their production extracted from them.  Their wealth was clustered in towns which could be fortified with walls that would resist any quick raid, but control of that fortified town center (and its administrative apparatus of taxation) meant control of the countryside and its resources.  Taking such a town meant a siege – delivering a large body of troops and keeping them there long enough to either breach the walls or starve out the town into surrender.  This created a war where …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>After doing a little searching, I’ve found it’s a little difficult to understand the differences between strongly typed, weakly typed, dynamically typed, and statically typed programming languages. I’d like to clear that up.</p>

<p>First, let’s define what typing is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In programming languages, a type system is a <strong>collection of rules</strong> that assign a property called a type to the various constructs—such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—a computer program is composed of. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. <strong>This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two important pieces to pull from the definition. The first is that a type system is a collection of rules. The second is that checking for the rules can apply at different times.</p>

<p>Here’s what we can deduce so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strongly typed - many rules</li>
<li>Weakly typed - few rules</li>
<li>Dynamically typed - rules applied at run time</li>
<li>Statically typed - rules applied at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an extremely helpful post by <a href="http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2011/07/11/dynamic-typing-is-not-weak-typing/">Naresh Jain</a> that includes this diagram:</p>

<p><a href="http://josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png"><img src="http://www.josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png" alt="strongweakstaticdynamic_type"></a></p>

<p>Naresh’s image shows that there are different degrees of typing. There are languages that have more rules (more strongly typed) than others.</p>

<p>Here’s another definition from Wikipedia that explains a strongly typed language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Liskov and Zilles described a strong-typed language as one in which “whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.” Jackson wrote, “In a strongly typed language each data area will have a <strong>distinct type</strong> and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this definition, PHP is NOT a strongly typed language because you can pass multiple variable types to the same function. Let’s take a look at this example of PHP:</p>

<pre><code>// Pass the integer 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo(4));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo('4'));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: Fatal error: Unsupported operand types
var_dump(foo(array(4)));

// Argument does not have a distinct type
function foo($bar)
{
    // Return the value + 5
    return $bar + 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the function, foo(), does not specify a distinct type for argument $bar so a programmer can pass any type of variable. The first time the function is called, the integer of 4 is passed and returns an integer of 9. The second time the function is called, the string of 4 is passed and again returns an integer of 9. The third and final time the function is called, an array containing an integer of 4 is passed and results in a Fatal Error.</p>

<p>The example above shows PHP is weakly typed and dynamically typed. In terms of the number of rules, PHP uses strings and integers interchangeably so there are “less rules”. Therefore, PHP is considered a weakly typed language. PHP is also dynamically typed because the rules are applied at run time instead of at compile time since PHP is not compiled and instead interpreted at run time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> PHP does support type hinting which makes it less weakly typed/more strongly typed, yet it is still considered a weakly typed language because you cannot use type hinting for integers or strings.</p>

<p>In summary, here are how I see the different types defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - types cannot be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Weakly typed</strong> - types can be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> - types are checked at run time</li>
<li><strong>Statically typed</strong> - types are checked at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this clears up a few things.</p>

As "the railrodder", Keaton crosses Canada from east to west on a railway track speeder. True to Keaton's genre, the film is full of sight gags as our protagonist putt-putts his way to British Columbia. Not a word is spoken throughout, and Keaton is as spry and ingenious at fetching laughs as he was in the old days of the silent slapsticks.

<p>You have no doubt heard of the

It made headlines when, in February 2020,
Chrome started rolling out changes to <code>SameSite</code>’s default behaviour;

Both in anticipation and in reaction to <code>SameSite</code>’s activation in browsers,
posts started
sprouting on blogs all over the Web to spread the word

such as <a href="https://twitter.com/rowan_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rowan Merewood</a>’s <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev piece</a>
entitled “SameSite cookies explained”.
Unfortunately, relatively few of the posts about <code>SameSite</code>
went to the effort of clarifying the concept of <em>site</em>,
from which the concepts of <em>same-site request</em> and <em>cross-site request</em>
are of course derived.</p>
<p>Moreover, many posts,
including those produced by influential members of the infosec community,
appeared to use the terms “origin” and “site” interchangeably or, at least,
somewhat loosely.</p>
<p>Back in February 2019, Kristian Bremberg <a href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/02/05/guide-http-security-headers-for-better-web-browser-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote the following</a>
on the venerable Detectify blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SameSite attribute is rather new and provides excellent protection
against CSRF attacks. If a cookie uses the SameSite attribute,
the web browser will make sure that the request made with the cookie came
from the <strong>origin</strong> that sat [sic] the cookie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Infosec superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> himself,
in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seminal post</a> entitled
“Promiscuous Cookies and Their Impending Death via the SameSite Policy”
and published in early January 2020, described the effects of the different
<code>SameSite</code> attribute values as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>None: what Chrome defaults to today without a SameSite value set</li>
<li>Lax: some limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
<li>Strict: tight limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>And a few months later, in an otherwise fascinating <a href="https://blog.reconless.com/samesite-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
analysing how the advent of <code>SameSite</code> was affecting a range of vulnerabilities
cherished by hackers,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xReconless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconless team</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the update, all cookies without an explicit <code>SameSite</code> attribute will
be treated as having <code>SameSite=Lax</code>.
This means <strong>cross-origin</strong> requests no longer carry cookies,
except for top-level navigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p><em>Domain</em>, <em>host</em>, <em>origin</em>, <em>site</em>…
Using those terms loosely in informal communication is natural;
such laxity in the use of terminology can be forgiven,
and if you’ve been guilty of it yourself, you’re in good company.</p>
<h2 id="are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">Are “site” and “origin” interchangeable? <a href="#are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">¶</a></h2>
<p>However, the advent of the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute raises some questions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a careful distinction between “origin” and “site” warranted, here?</li>
<li>Is it just a distinction without a difference?</li>
<li>Is a <em>cross-site</em> request no different from a <em>cross-origin</em> request?</li>
<li>Could the cookie attribute have as well been named “SameOrigin”, then?</li>
<li>Or, if there is indeed a real difference between “site” and “origin”,
does it matter to practitioners?</li>
<li>And, if the difference does matter, how so?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have already guessed the answers from the title of this post:
“site” has a very technical meaning in the context of <code>SameSite</code>,
yet it is unduly neglected;
and the distinction between <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> <em>does</em> matter,
yet the two concepts are frequently conflated.</p>
<p>This lapse in terminology didn’t escape everyone.
That Google’s <em>Developer Advocate of Web</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/agektmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eiji Kitamura</a>
felt the need to dedicate
a whole <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
about the distinction between “origin” and “site”,
only a few months after Chrome activated <code>SameSite</code>, is revealing.</p>
<p>In order to understand why the distinction matters,
you first need to understand the difference between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-origin">What do we mean by “origin”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-origin">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work with Web technologies,
you have at least some familiarity with the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</a>,
arguably one of the main pillar of Web security.
The concept of <em>origin</em> of a URI is of course central to the SOP and,
as such, it is relatively well-understood.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.2 of RFC 6454</a> defines an <em>origin</em> as a triple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly speaking, two URIs are part of the same origin
(i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
scheme, host, and port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The port is optional; if not specified, the default port associated to the scheme
is implied (e.g. 80 for <code>http</code> and 443 for <code>https</code>).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Glossary/Origin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN Web Docs</a> has a series of useful examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-site">What do we mean by “site”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-site">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behind the painfully generic term that is “site”
hides a concept fundamentally more difficult to grasp
than that of <em>origin</em>.
For one thing, the term “site” was not always a technical one:
it predates the SOP and was in in common use
<a href="https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when attacks like cross-site scripting came onto the scene</a>.
Furthermore, the modern concept of <em>site</em> is fraught with technical difficulties.
It is intimately linked to that of a host’s <em>registrable domain</em>,
which the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-registrable-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Living Standard</a> defines as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a domain formed by the most specific public suffix,
along with the domain label immediately preceeding it, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A host’s registrable domain is also known as its “eTLD+1”, short for
“effective top-level domain plus one”.)</p>
<p>In the simplest of cases, <strong>the site of an origin simply corresponds
to the registrable domain (if any) of the origin’s host</strong>.</p>
<p>Two examples, to fix ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site of <code>https://www.example.org</code> is <code>example.org</code>,
because <code>org</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>example.org</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
<li>The site of <code>https://jub0bs.github.io</code> is <code>jub0bs.github.io</code>,
because <code>github.io</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>jub0bs.github.io</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! Perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>github.io</code> is a public suffix</a>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the concept of registrable domain is a fluid one,
because it relies on the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public-Suffix List</a>,
a list which is not set in stone but <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to change over time</a>.
Not to mention that different browsers may not necessarily stay abreast of
changes to the Public-Suffix list at the same pace.</p>
<p>The technicalities do not end there!
As <a href="https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev warns us</a>,
the concept of <em>site</em> is still evolving and
will soon incorporate the scheme also.
The change currently sits behind a flag in Chrome but will soon be rolled out.
However, to sidestep this difficulty and prolong the relevance of this post,
I’ll only consider origins whose scheme is <code>https</code> in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">Same-site vs. cross-site requests <a href="#same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dealt with the concept of <em>site</em>,
we can finally discuss the concepts of <em>same-site</em> and <em>cross-site</em> requests.
A given request is either <em>same-site</em> or <em>cross-site</em>.
Whether a request is same-site or cross-site depends on the comparison
between the sites of the request’s source origin and target origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two sites are identical, the request is said to be <em>same-site</em>;</li>
<li>If the two sites are different, the request is said to be <em>cross-site</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site,
because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.github.io</code>
to <code>https://bar.github.io</code> is cross-site,
because the site of the first origin is <code>foo.github.io</code>,
whereas the site of the second origin is <code>bar.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.bar.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site, because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve made it this far down the present post, I thank you for your patience.
Take heart: the payoff is near!</p>
<h2 id="cross-origin-same-site-requests">Cross-origin, same-site requests <a href="#cross-origin-same-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>All cross-site requests are necessarily cross-origin; that much is clear.
However, as shown by the first and third examples above,
not all cross-origin requests are cross-site.</p>
<p><img src="https://jub0bs.com/images/cor_vs_csr.svg" alt="Venn-diagram"></p>
<p>And the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is only concerned with cross-site requests;
it has no effect on cross-origin requests that happen to be same-site.
This is why the distinction between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em> is important.</p>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo <a href="#online-demo">¶</a></h2>
<p>To prove my point,
I’ve drawn inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt’s post</a> and
I’ve deployed a simple Go server to <code>samesitedemo.jub0bs.com</code> composed
of two simple endpoints.
Endpoint <code>/setcookie</code> sets a <code>SameSite=Strict</code> cookie, like so</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>Set-Cookie: StrictCookie=foo; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict
</span></code></pre></div><p>Endpoint <code>/readcookie</code> prints the cookie (if any) attached to the request.
I’ve also set up two “attacking” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both pages simply consist in a single link to
<code>https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/readcookie</code>.</p>
<p>To fix ideas, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie</a>.
Doing so will set the <code>Strict</code> cookie in your browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the attacking URI (<code>jub0bs.github.io</code>)
is different from that of the target URI (<code>jub0bs.com</code>),
the browser does not attach the cookie to the request resulting from
following the link, and no cookie gets printed in the response.
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as expected, and the “attack” is foiled.</li>
<li>Now navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the …</li></ol></div></div>

<p><strong>Notes Taken: 2021-01-28</strong></p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0">GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Martin explains there are several different understandings of what Event-Driven Architecture is. All of these are valid but are distinct in their actual form. Martin delves into four of these.</p>
<p>At a high level, there is a difference between events and commands.
Events explain, 'something <strong>has</strong> happened', the receiver is free to ignore the event or do something in response to the event occurring.
Commands explain, 'something <strong>should</strong> happen', the producer of the command has to know what command to issue.
Events and commands are both valid, the disadvantage of commands is that the producer has to know which system wants to react to a command, and the producer must issue the appropriate command - arguably this creates more coupling.</p>
<p>The four patterns of Event-Driven Architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Notification</li>
<li>Event Carried State Transfer</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pattern-1-event-notification">Pattern 1: Event Notification</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=200s">Timecode - 3:20</a></p>
<p>Martin pictures a system where a user changes their address in the <strong>Customer Management System</strong>, this should cause the&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Quoting System</strong> to calculate a new quote for the customer. In a classic model, the customer management system must call out to the Insurance Quoting System to order a requote. This creates a strong coupling, in particular the Customer Management System is dependent on the Insurance Quoting System. This is likely suboptimal as the Insurance Quoting System is a more specialised and less general system than the Customer Management System; Martin argues dependencies should usually be drawn from specialised systems to more general systems. Instead of calling from the Customer Management System to the Insurance Quoting System, the Customer Management System could publish an event 'CustomerAddressChange' to a queue, and the Insurance Quoting System could listen for these events and requote the customer when it receives the event. This effectively alters a coupling of&nbsp;'<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Insurance Quoting System</em>' into&nbsp;<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Event Queue &lt;- Insurance Quoting System</em>.
This is the most basic of event architectures, it simply alters the way dependencies can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-2-event-carried-state-transfer">Pattern 2: Event Carried State Transfer</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=893s">Timecode - 14:53</a></p>
<p>A less common pattern. Built atop Event Notification, when we receive an event, we pull the data from the Customer Management System and store the relevant parts in our own database. This means the Insurance Quoting System can stay available, even when the Customer Management System goes down. The problem is we now have to copies of data so we lose consistency.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-3-event-sourcing">Pattern 3: Event Sourcing</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=1251s">Timecode - 20:51</a></p>
<p>The previous two patterns are largely still CRUD, when we make a change, we save it to a database,&nbsp;<strong>overwriting</strong> the previous value and maybe publishing an event.
Event Sourcing changes this, we both overwrite the current state but we also log an event to an event log.
We now have a system with two forms of state, the <strong>application state</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The application state is the point in time state, which can be recovered from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The standard for an event sourcing system, is that at any point in time the application state can be destroyed and we can&nbsp;<strong>reliably recover</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
In Event Sourcing, we move from being oriented around application state, with events as an optional extra, to being oriented around a log of all events, with application state derived from that log.</p>
<p>Developers are constantly using an example of an event sourcing program, almost all vcs systems such as git are event sourced.
The current commit/working state is the application state, and branches, commits, etc are all just events in the event log.
For business people, an accounting system makes for a good analogy to an event sourced system.
The current balance of accounts is the application state, but the series of entries in the ledger is the set of events that are used to construct that state.</p>
<p>One great benefit of Event Sourcing is that we can change the models of application state at any time, and fully reconstruct from our event log. Instead of writing database migrations when data models change, like we do in the SQL world, we just change how state is derived from events. We can even test systems in a read only mode against production, by reading the event log to construct a new application state. One key advantage Martin mentions is that Event Sourcing enables a 'Memory Image'. This essentially means that our application state can be completely ephemeral, and in memory; you don't need a database for application state, you only need to read from the event log and construct the application state in memory. This can be very fast and performant. The other benefit of this is that memory is super fast, and you can essentially avoid database calls, whilst having persistence. Martin mentions, think about the opportunities opening up here as we begin to see more and more systems with high amounts of RAM or super fast non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p>There are added complexities. Consider how you can order events reliably. Consider how you ensure transactional guarantees, if you write to the event log, you must also update the application state at the same time. You can't update application state before writing to the event log because then you have a working state that is ahead of the event log state, and remember, the event log state is the source of truth. Event Sourcing systems generally bring asynchrony with them, and this can add quite a bit of complexity. You must also consider consistency, what does it mean to write to the event log, if other systems are going to react to those events, they will not be consistent at the point of time you write to the event log. This is a trade off with all event driven architectures however.</p>
<p>Martin mentions in passing that he is very surprised by how uncommon Event Sourcing is in practice.</p>
<p>Martin brings forward a final and very important consideration when Event Sourcing. We must carefully consider which events are worth storing, and which are not. Suppose there is a service that receives an order to 'buy 15 widgets', the service then creates a transaction that is stored in the application state, this transaction contains additional info like the tax applied and any discounts applied. The service could persist an event with the business logic derived details, such as tax and discounts, or an event that most closely mirrors the input request. The advantage of the former is that the event log contains a more precise record of what was computed at the time the request was received, the advantage with the latter is that it contains only the bare minimum required to recompute the application state, and nothing more. In practice, many systems persist both types of events. Greg Young says that there should be no business logic between your events and your application state.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-4-command-query-responsibility-segregation">Pattern 4: Command Query Responsibility Segregation</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=2611s">Timecode - 43:31</a></p>
<p>Martin warns outright, this is a complex pattern that is more often than not implemented incorrectly, and can cause troubles if so. The idea here is to separate out the write (command) path from the read (query) path of your system. This is particularly useful when you have an application that is read from much more frequently than it is read from, especially if the reads are of a form derived from the write form.</p>

<section id=""><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Bathed in light, the world remains our first and last love.” —Albert Camus</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone writing seriously about utopia in September of 2020 will seem—to be charitable—a little disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>The American West is burning. The Arctic is melting. Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Nearly a million people have died from the coronavirus. Economic inequality continues to grow, only accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>If there’s anything like a road to utopia—if we can even begin to entertain such an idea—we don’t seem to be on it. The belief that society’s problems can be solved seems ridiculous when each day brings fresh horrors. Our collective failure to make so much as a dent on climate change, the cancerous spread of polarizing misinformation with its fracturing of society, and the irretrievable damage we are inflicting on the biosphere, only deepen a sense that the best we can hope for now is adaptation and survival in an environment increasingly hostile (physically, psychologically, spiritually) to the individual.</p>
<p>But hope, as “Mad” Max Rockatansky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN4sboc7E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us from the other side of collapse</a>, is a mistake, and despair paralyzes. What we need are viable alternatives. Alternatives that go beyond bolt-on fixes to broken systems. Alternatives we can imagine living—and thriving—in. And most importantly, alternatives we can look for in our present and in our past, not in some idealized future.</p>
<p>Utopia is in the air again, though few dare call it by that name. Ideas that would be dismissed just a few short years ago as “utopian”—a word that has been cut down to pejorative status—are entering into the mainstream. Political programs like the Green New Deal promise solutions that could spare us from the worst effects of climate change while stimulating the economy. Universal Basic Income and its brethren suggest how we might mend broken social safety nets and ease economic inequality. But what we lack, and urgently need, is a vision of the world we want to bring into being. That’s all utopianism is: the audacity to imagine the world we want, and then living as though that world were possible.</p>
<p>Metals become malleable when subjected to heat. In higher temperatures, they melt, making it possible to cast existing forms into new shapes. Culture I/O is premised on a belief that under certain conditions, the malleability of our society increases as well. The coming decade, more than any other in recent memory, will be turbulent and heated. In the words of Arundhati Roy: <em>“We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</em> </p>

<li>A society consists of individuals. Only individuals suffer, experience joy, love, longing, pleasure, pain, act with intent, die. They can do so collectively, but always and only as individuals. <strong>In the end, only individuals matter.</strong></li>
<li>This is an ontological position, not a value judgement. A family or society exists only insofar as its individual members exist.</li>
<li>Because of this, we should reject any ideology that stresses the primacy of a group at the expense of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, we should reject any ideology that places a system (such as markets) above individuals.</li>
<li>This should not be taken as an endorsement of individualism. Individuals do not exist in isolation. The point is simply that we should always treat individuals as <em>ends</em>, never as <em>means</em>.</li>
<li>Humans are complex, emotional, self-aware animals with a degree of free will—not rational agents, logic machines, or biological algorithms.</li>
<li>Humans are not the only complex, emotional, self-aware animals on this planet.</li>

<ul>
<li>The human brain is the most mysterious and versatile physical structure in the known world. We know more about how the universe came to be than how the brain works.</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between brain, mind, and consciousness is the greatest scientific question of our time.</li>
<li>Though we are emotional creatures first and foremost, we are wired for reason. Using only his mind and some crude observations, Aristarchus of the Greek island of Samos figured out that the Earth orbits the Sun almost 2,000 years before this became accepted fact. Einstein produced four of his groundbreaking papers in one year spent hunched over a desk in a musty Bern patent office, with reason as his only instrument.</li>
<li>In spite of these impressive abilities, we are extremely susceptible to biases and fallacies in our thinking—and to those who would exploit these biases.</li>
<li>The either/or fallacy is one of the most pernicious of these errors, passed down to us by Aristotle. It suggests that everything must be either this, or that. Good or bad. Nature or nurture. Introvert or extrovert. Liberal or conservative. It is the binary logic of machines applied to an analog world full of semantic nuance, contradiction, and mystery. If we are, on a species-level, in trouble, it is in large part because of our inability to internalize the fact that multiple ideas which seem opposed to each other can simultaneously be true.</li>
<li>This does not mean that truth is relative. It isn’t. Only that out in the world, truth is more complicated than it seems. If we simplify the world in order to function in it, we do so at our peril.</li>

<p><span><em>“The map is not the territory.” —Alfred Korzybski</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Words are not reality—they represent abstractions that allow us to make sense of reality, to think and talk about it.</li>
<li>This is important because it means that words do not and cannot map perfectly to reality, and that different languages—systems of words—can reflect reality in subtly different ways.</li>
<li>Words matter. Words and mind are inextricably linked and together they create the feedback loop that makes reasoning possible.</li>
<li>The abuse of language is a form of psychological abuse. George Orwell memorably took it to task in <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Politics and the English Language</em></a> three quarters of a century ago, but we’ve been at it for much, much longer. What is new is the degree to which words have saturated our lives. Social media and 24 hour news have made it impossible to escape.</li>
<li>Precision and clarity are how we push back against the abuse of language. Because we use words to think, choosing them with care leads to clearer arguments and thoughts. We should always strive to practice good linguistic hygiene, and to use language in good faith—for our own sanity, if nothing else.</li>
<li>Where pushing back is impossible, we must step away. Silence can be a virtue.</li>
<li>The only way to have a productive discussion involving abstractions (democracy, justice, utopia) is to clearly and rigorously define them first. Often we’ll find that the discussion ends up fixating on the definitions of the words themselves. This is a good thing.</li>

<ul>
<li>We are surrounded by and enmeshed in systems.</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of systems helps us to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world.</li>
<li>Societies are systems. Culture is a system. Governments, markets, weather, language, and the biosphere are all examples of systems.</li>
<li>Some complex systems are too big and too complicated to think about coherently. We call these types of systems <em><strong>hyperobjects</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Complex systems can be broken down into simpler ones for the purpose of thinking about them.</li>
<li>It’s possible to understand how a system works without being able to make accurate predictions about it. But we should be wary of our tendency to believe that we understand systems which we do not.</li>
<li>It’s impossible to make accurate long-term predictions about most complex systems.</li>
<li>Some systems tend towards stability through self-regulation, while others are inherently unstable.</li>
<li>It’s not necessary to understand how a system works before acting to change it. In fact, history is the story of humans collectively changing or dismantling systems before understanding them—often with serious consequences (like climate). But a system must be understood in order to effectively change it <em>with a specific outcome in mind</em>.</li>
<li>It’s unproductive to approach systems dogmatically. No system is inherently good or bad. But we should evaluate systems, especially those created by humans, based on our convictions about what is desirable and undesirable.</li>
<li>Most complex systems are interwoven with others and cannot be fully understood in isolation.</li>

<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>

<p><em>Parental anxieties can damage kids’ relationship with food</em></p>



<p><em><sub>(The below completed story, assigned to me by <strong>Optimum Wellness</strong>, is posted here with permission from my editor. It’s been held indefinitely as Covid has affected many magazines’ page counts, but I wanted to get it out there as I really enjoyed this one!)</sub> </em></p>







<p>By Sarah Protzman Howlett</p>



<p>As parents, it can be a tall order to foster positive body image and a healthy relationship with food in our kids when both are sore subjects in our own lives. The new book&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Intuitive-Eating-Healthy/dp/1612439330">A Parent’s Guide to Intuitive Eating</a>” by pediatrician <a href="https://www.doctoryami.com/">Dr. Yami&nbsp;Cazorla-Lancaster</a> helps parents navigate these confusing waters using the principles of intuitive eating, a so-called “anti-diet” that eschews food restrictions. In the book, Dr. Yami outlines five pillars she says will help parents cultivate adventurous, joyful meal times for everyone at the table, no matter what hang-ups lurk in your past.</p>



<p><strong>Honor hunger and satiety</strong></p>



<p>Parents should decide what food to serve and when, Dr. Yami says—and then? <em>Shhhh</em>. “After you’ve presented the food, your job is done,” she says. Steer clear of any goading: <em>Come on, have another bite! Don’t you want more? You didn’t even touch your broccoli. If you want dessert, you have to eat your…</em> are all counterproductive, she says. Instead, let the child know they will never be forced to eat but that they must use manners, perhaps remaining at the table until everyone is done eating. Parents who are fearful their child is too small or too large seem to struggle most with this one, Dr. Yami says: “When a parent is anxious about a kid who is larger or more robust, or is very lean or petite, they’ll start urging a few more bites and so forth,” she says. “In other words, intervening when the child should be using their own intuition.”</p>



<p><strong>Emphasize whole-plant foods</strong></p>



<p>This phrasing intimidates many parents, Dr. Yami says, because it conjures images of salad and little else, when in reality plant-based eating is much broader. Think beyond mere leaves and create meals around the foods kids almost universally love that also happen to be plants: potatoes, corn, fruit, etc. Plant-forward meals decrease the risk of chronic disease and increase longevity, she says, and are packed with fiber and antioxidants. Avoid restrictive diets, especially ones that forbid foods widely considered healthy, she says: “The Paleo diet eliminates beans and whole grains, which are very health promoting and support the gut microbiome,” she says, “and fad diets like Keto can be incredibly dangerous for kids because of the lack of macronutrients. We can have carbs and fat as part of delicious, abundant meals.”</p>



<p><strong>Establish a positive environment</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Yami urges filling your home with health-promoting foods, making sure what’s available matches the messaging: “If you tell your kids to eat fruits and vegetables but there are chips everywhere, you’re not giving the brain and the eyes an opportunity to make those things part of kids’ consciousness,” she says. Further, examine what body-image messages your kids may be absorbing, through TV, social media and films, or hearing talk about dieting or body size—be it yours or someone else’s. “You may be telling your kids ‘all bodies are good bodies’ but have a magazine that says LOSE 10 POUNDS on the cover,” she says. “You put the culture into your child’s brain.”</p>



<p><strong>Be flexible</strong></p>



<p>Parents should feel free to honor the cultural importance of, for instance, cake at birthday parties, candy on Halloween and chocolate bunnies on Easter—again, without additional commentary that can instill guilt. “When they eat their cake, don’t give them the side eye or say something like, ‘I think you’ve had enough,’ ” she says. For older kids, Dr. Yami advises candid conversations about sugar, salt and fat—and how we as humans are naturally driven to eat those things because they taste good. For parents with younger kids, the temptation to forbid sugar can backfire once a child goes to school and sees other kids enjoying such foods in moderation. Denying access to sweets or other foods deemed “bad” can lead kids to hoard food, binge or hide candy wrappers in their pockets, she says.</p>



<div><p><strong>Relax and have fun</strong></p><p>Dr. Yami says too many parents in her practice deal with crushing guilt and shame over any number of parenting issues, but that tensions run highest where food is concerned. “Parents are so anxious, and the dinner table becomes stressful,” she says. “When it comes to food, parents do not need to be saints or be perfect. Their kid is going to be <em>fine</em>. We are not trying to feed them enough broccoli to get into Harvard.” She says that if a parent is getting whole-plant foods into their child’s diet, to not overthink the rest. Pressure and perfectionism zaps all joy from family mealtimes; she says. “Your kids love you, so give yourself space and time to try different things,” she says. “You do not have to get everything right all the time.”</p></div>



<div><p><strong>&gt;&gt; No “bad” foods</strong></p><p>In Dr. Yami’s family, no nosh is forbidden. But this cornerstone of intuitive eating—that no food is banned or off limits—doesn’t ignore the fact that some foods pack more nutrition than others. “I call them ‘health-promoting foods’ and ‘play foods,’ ” she says. “Play foods are fun but are probably more processed, and we won’t eat them all the time.” Regardless of what your kids may hear at school—that certain foods are “good” and others are “bad”—parents who reject this rigid way of thinking about food must say so, and say so often. “You can say, ‘Some foods help us feel better and have more health benefits than other foods, but nothing is off limits,’ ” she says. “That gives kids the ability to keep foods on an even platform.”</p></div>

At Leet Resumes, we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, so we thought we’d share and compare Google’s advice with our own, show where they mostly line up, and show where your resume needs to appeal to employers beyond Google. Given our focus, we’ll concentrate on how this advice applies to experienced technical or engineering professionals.</p><p>With three exceptions, the Google recruiters’ advice matches up with Leet Resumes’ advice, and I’ll explain why their advice is so very accurate, and also where we differ and why (the Google way is not everybody’s way). Further, we explain our design choices in detail in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/41QpzF22JQx1YWrqtbdI56bA9Tp4VDHJlk6zX3z0Zk1T3PfU-chPyOcDFcCefMOOOIdxjJZOkOktgrpXBtUiitjiiluKsA7BSY0BeOOaccP_D8jWO6hndjFKtUOJDzUojsL0-dCp" alt="Google's resume advice"></p><p>First off, Jeremy and Lizi advise, “Make sure the format is simple and consistent in design, font, sizing, and spacing throughout so that the person reviewing your resume can easily scan and find information quickly.”</p><p>This sounds like obvious advice, but many engineers complicate their resumes with colors, columns, graphics, multiple fonts, font colors, and font sizes, that they put a tremendous burden on the people reading their resumes. Simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tv3HpXghtb62OxzGg0kDxdHB9icAzEmefiNvqiu-oRsy-rqXTshmq0a-Bn0L0Ll-mIf-Uxa1EYNyvVHmB2-m0UH-iw3_HaIh_9CNwBbJU-_LWRqK8tuKpdVWcX7Sw98F6Isrndrk" alt="Google's Resume Basics"></p><p>They continue, “Include your contact information and email at the top. You don't have to include objective statements [or] references. Use bullet points with consistent formatting and structure throughout the resume rather than long paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Keep your resume to… no longer than two pages for engineering roles. And perhaps the most important tip we have overall is to always check for typos.”</p><p>We agree with all of this advice at Leet. Bullet points and quick, scannable text are far superior to long paragraphs. It’s how readers ingest resumes in 2021.</p><p>On resume length, in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>, we advise 1 page for those with 10 years’ or fewer experience, and 2 pages for those with 10 or more years of experience.</p><p>Typos might seem like a small matter, but many engineering managers have learned that engineers who aren’t careful with their resumes, also aren’t careful with their code. Be smart about it and check very carefully.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VFrSANgZ36uEfJ41lzjU8mNBtKwQW9i1lYqONH1QTq51yYw94r6TauDAjsjnJr2QPOZXPeiZTdrHRBrUcjR2NdBvusvD6rDQukbbOElz7FxaIiYwJaMRBtVMIPhZqDEK625_R2hs" alt="Google Resume Basics: Lengths"></p><p>Lizi and Jeremy continue, “It's also critical you list your GitHub profile or other prominent open source work that shows us you're contributing to the open source community, passionate about the work you're doing, and looking to improve your skills.”</p><p>We agree that your Github link should be in your contact information, and that your LinkedIn (which is a subset of your resume info, and therefore extraneous) should not be.</p><p>Jeremy and Lizi further comment that, “Experience should take up the bulk of your resume.”</p><p>Another obvious point, perhaps, but the most popular formats online, including those at the top of Google search results for software engineering resume template, break this good advice. These complex formats often push the experience section into as little as 25% of the available surface area of a resume. Again, simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P5XdrU6yP7ny6VNex_pCz7s3iuLbHuWZFfzvhB9of3mF_LKl9WN4jBKO7wuYoJ8wiMa8KHg8we-irDUWmE0EvBPPCAOZ471Dk7ITzqIttWRxc2n_4J-pZZk0FQcIWNxkXd3h5KVL" alt="Google Resume Advice: Experience"></p><p>The Google duo share: “List everything in reverse chronological order with your most recent experience first. Include your employer, position, and dates employed for all jobs… in the month-year format. Keep your bullet point descriptions concise and clear, and make the most of your space by streamlining bullet points that spill over onto the next line by only one or two words.”</p><p>Again, we agree and the resumes we write for experienced engineers follow these same guidelines. Concise and clear is usually a problem for engineers writing their own resumes, and that’s where Leet can be a big help in cutting out words, phrases, and even whole bullets that don’t advance your story.</p><p>“For each bullet, use action words like created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed, and so on, so the person reading your resume can easily and quickly understand your skills and experience.”</p><p>At Leet, we go further and suggest that you use success verbs - verbs that show how your work created successes - rather than simply using verbs such as managed or developed, which are more focused on duties and responsibilities instead of outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yXV2gqPytpBnWWAETYkNC0dIysQ4DTUjMzKtasBMyzvIlwAVR_aXM_EVUmNAcLNpXQFJZRlxihRFc91s9HK2o3Zg1exQ9cESP6hEzXFdIUrnSLrggUNPCi74z5QVMTcgJMnU1vHk" alt="null"></p><p>“It's important to focus on the results and impact of your work, so list metrics and examples concisely rather than writing long descriptions. We value data at Google and want to see you know how to apply it when speaking to your accomplishments. Use data and comparisons or averages to provide context.</p><p>“To ensure you focus on results and impact in this section, we recommend using this helpful framework – accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z.”</p><p>Google is exactly right on this advice - use data, numbers, and metrics, to explain your results. Instead of writing that you reduced page load time, write that you reduced page load time from 700 ms to 322 ms. Numbers make your accomplishments seem more real, and are more persuasive.</p><p>Lizi continues, “Let's walk through a few examples for different types of experience.”</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rGmPHOn7Y7NP4NGMbiRYaRw0uhuUtNJ0Pas5lVfhUyu_2jzHHj5g355j45sLsvwepTZRJk52Fb1jIlTfeKxWN0L5g2Uxlfb7TSzSBMR-47glDip-Yn6w-WRp5nKq1C4Fcsb49RTD" alt="Googel Metrics on your resume"></p><p>“If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, this example should be particularly helpful… ‘Increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring API.’</p><p>“This concisely conveys the impact backed up by data and communicates a skill. In this case, it's restructuring an API, but it could be an experience like adding new hardware, algorithmic improvements, caching answers, or implementing machine learning.”</p><p>Three cheers for Google on making this point so effectively.&nbsp; <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume%C2%A0">Your technical resume should include numbers</a>.</p><p>A few more good points from the Google folks before we get into our disagreements.</p><p>“Include any relevant leadership positions, awards, university honors, scholarships, or other types of recognition.”</p><p>Remember, recognition indicates that someone else thought you were good, worthy, and successful. Including these external validations help show that your career progress is already endorsed by others - a good sign for a future boss.</p><p>And they also mention, “If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, be sure to include the programming language you used in bold for each project you include.”</p><p>This is advice unique to Google, and I feel more targeted towards junior engineers, for whom the particular language experience is important in hiring. The further you rise in your engineering career, the more the specifics of language choice and deployment fall away, and the bigger architectural issues come to predominate in any assessment of your capabilities.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve agreed with everything Google has to say, right? They’re flawless, right? Well, not quite. There are a few bits of advice that aren’t effective for candidates who are not applying to Google. Specifically:</p><p>“PDF formatting is preferred.”</p><p>As I’ve shared in my <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/resume-parser-ceos-advice-for-your-resume%C2%A0">mega-interview with the CEOs and technical experts at resume parsing</a> companies, PDFs can sometimes render in a graphical format that evade the comprehension of companies’ HR systems.&nbsp; MS Word, Google Docs, or even .txt should be preferred over PDF.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h_35s4QCEIIqyHzXasPCxCgdxtH55imC75BRzAa2zNi5pSD7NKiSp_JQA7smxG10Ollge5rr7Gibcckbo6ubCzspbUVqr91HCEq_fGKVRFGxFJsruYYUR66-xqy_2lEzwOoA3-SS" alt="null"></p><p>“List your programming languages at the top of your resume and make sure you're comfortable interviewing in them.”</p><p>In contrast to most other technical resume advice, Google suggests putting your programming languages at the top of your resume. I honestly don’t see how this advice can be realistic for most experienced programmers, and Leet Resumes places your technologies at the bottom of your resume.</p><p>To take just two examples, here are the technologies listed by two Leet Resumes users today:</p><p><u>Example 1</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Java</p><p>Frameworks/Libraries: Express, NestJS, React, Redux, Cypress, Jest, Selenium, ReactNative, Node.js</p><p><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose</p><p><strong>Certification:</strong> Certified Scrum Master</p><p><u>Example 2</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Terraform, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Bash, CSS</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> AWS Services, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Postgres, Camunda (BPM Engine), Gradle, Maven</p><p><strong>Libraries/Frameworks:</strong> SQLAlchemy, boto3, JUnit, Pytest, Spring/Spring Boot</p><p><strong>Other:</strong> Node.js, SocketCluster, REST APIs, Dreamfactory</p><p>It does not seem possible or realistic that either of these technology professionals could fit their technologies at the top of their resume without breaking the important formatting conventions that both Leet and Google advocate regarding placement of work experience and professional summary.</p><p>And finally, their advice to customize your resume per job simply isn’t accurate, “A big tip here is to read the job description and look at the language it uses. Writing a resume for a specific job description takes a little bit of effort, but it can really help your application stand out. You can even bold and italicize keywords related to the job description to highlight your relevant skills and experience.”</p><p>As with all users, there is a difference between what technical recruiters believe they do, and what they actually do. Given the amount of time spent in reviewing a resume, only the absolutely most relevant keywords are considered - perhaps 2 or 3, sometimes as many as 6.&nbsp; But never, ever dozens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Your Leet resume will list all of the technologies in which you are proficient, and all of your major accomplishments. So if your well-constructed, thorough, thought-through resume doesn’t already have those 2-6 keywords on it, are you really a fit for the job?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s simply unlikely that your primary resume is truly missing a critical keyword that can be added to a secondary resume to catch a recruiter’s eye, and there is therefore no need to customize multiple resumes with keywords.</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this review of the advice Google recruiters have for your technical resume. If you’d like Leet to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">write your technical resume for free,</a> please sign up.&nbsp; You can also read the stories of other engineers - there’s a reason we can say users love us!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p><b>Scientists from Alfred Wegener Institute: “We need to have a fresh look at the role of the Arctic Ocean.”</b></p>
		

		<p><span>[03. February 2021]&nbsp;</span>
			
			
				<b><p>The Arctic Ocean was covered by up to 900 m thick shelf ice and was filled entirely with freshwater at least twice in the last 150,000 years. This surprising finding, reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature, is the result of long-term research by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute and the MARUM. With a detailed analysis of the composition of marine deposits, the scientists could demonstrate that the Arctic Ocean as well as the Nordic Seas did not contain sea-salt in at least two glacial periods. Instead, these oceans were filled with large amounts of freshwater under a thick ice sheet. This water could then be released into the North Atlantic in very short periods of time. Such sudden freshwater inputs could explain rapid climate oscillations for which no satisfying explanation had been previously found.</p></b>

			<p>About 60.000 to 70.000 years ago, in a particularly cold part of the last glacial period, large parts of Northern Europe and North America were covered by ice sheets. The European ice sheet spanned a distance of more than 5000 kilometres, from Ireland and Scotland via Scandinavia to the Eastern rim of the Kara Sea (Arctic Ocean). In North America, large parts of what is now known as Canada were buried under two large ice sheets. Greenland and parts of the Bering Sea coastline were glaciated too. What was the ice situation like even further North, in the Arctic Ocean? Was it covered by thick sea-ice, or maybe with the tongues of these vast ice sheets were floating on it, far beyond the North Pole?</p>
<p>Scientific answers to these questions were more or less hypothetical so far. In contrast to deposits on land, where erratic boulders, moraines and glacial valleys are the obvious landmarks of glaciers, only few traces of vast ice shelves had been found so far in the Arctic Ocean. Geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have now compiled existing evidence from the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, and combined it with new data to arrive at a surprising conclusion.</p>
<p>According to their study, the floating parts of the northern ice sheets covered large parts of the Arctic Ocean in the past 150,000 years. Once about 70,000-60,000 years ago and also about 150,000-130,000 years ago. In both periods, freshwater accumulated under the ice, creating a completely fresh Arctic Ocean for thousands of years.</p>

			<p>“These results mean a real change to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean in glacial climates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete freshening of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas has been considered - happening not just once, but twice,” says the first author, Dr Walter Geibert, geochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute.</p>

			<h3><span>Thorium is absent in the sediments, so saline water must have been absent</span></h3>
<p>Their finding is based on geological analyses of ten sediment cores from different parts of the Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas. The stacked deposits mirror the climate history of the past glacials. When investigating and comparing the sediment records, the geoscientists found that an important indicator was missing, always in the same two intervals. “In saline sea water, the decay of naturally occurring uranium always results in the production of the isotope thorium-230. This substance accumulates at the sea floor, where it remains detectable for a very long time due to its half-life of 75,000 years,” Walter Geibert explains.</p>
<p>Therefore, geologists often use this thorium-isotope as a natural clock. “Here, its repeated and wide-spread absence is the giveaway that reveals to us what happened. According to our knowledge, the only reasonable explanation for this pattern is that the Arctic Ocean was filled with freshwater twice in its younger history- in frozen and liquid form,” co-author and micropalaeontologist Dr Jutta Wollenburg, also from the AWI, explains. &nbsp;</p>

			<h3><span>A new picture of the Arctic Ocean</span></h3>
<p>How can a large ocean basin, connected by several straits with the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, turn entirely fresh? “Such a scenario is perceivable if we realize that in glacial periods, global sea levels were up to 130 m lower than today, and ice masses in the Arctic may have restricted ocean circulation even further,” states co-author Professor Ruediger Stein, geologist at the AWI and the MARUM.</p>
<p>Shallow connections like Bering Strait or the sounds of the Canadian Archipelago were above sea level at the time, cutting off the connection with the Pacific Ocean entirely. In the Nordic Seas, large icebergs or ice sheets extending onto the sea floor restricted the exchange of water masses. The flow of glaciers, ice melt in summer, and rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean kept delivering large amounts of fresh water to the system, at least 1200 cubic kilometres per year. A part of this amount would have been forced via the Nordic Seas through the sparse narrow deeper connections in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic, hindering saline water from penetrating further north. This resulted in the freshening of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

			<p>“Once the mechanism of ice barriers failed, heavier saline water could fill the Arctic Ocean again,” Walter Geibert says. “We believe that it could then quickly displace the lighter freshwater, resulting in a sudden discharge of the accumulated amount of freshwater over the shallow southern boundary of the Nordic Seas, the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge, into the North Atlantic.”</p>
<p>A concept that assumes that enormous amounts of freshwater were stored in the Arctic Ocean and available for rapid release would help understanding the connection between a range of past climate fluctuations. It would also offer an explanation for some apparent discrepancies between different ways of reconstructing past sea levels. “The remains of coral reefs have pointed to a somewhat higher sea level in certain cold periods than reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores, or reconstructions from the calcareous shells of small marine organisms, would suggest,” explains Walter Geibert. “If we now accept that freshwater may not only have been stored in solid form on land, but some of it also in liquid form in the ocean, the different sea level reconstructions agree better and we can reconcile the location of the coral reefs with calculations of the freshwater budget.”</p>
<p>Freshwater release from the Arctic Ocean might also serve as an explanation for some abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period. &nbsp;During such events, temperatures in Greenland could rise by 8-10 degree centigrade within a few years, only returning to the original cold glacial temperatures over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. “We see an example here of a past Arctic climate tipping point of the Earth system. Now we need to investigate in more detail how these processes were interconnected, and evaluate how this new concept of the Arctic Ocean helps in closing further gaps in our knowledge, in particular in view of the risks of manmade climate change,” says Walter Geibert.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s evening and I’m listening to some music while I’m casually browsing the web. After a couple of minutes This tweet came about:</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:</p><p>🔸 Input: "aaaabbbcca"<br>🔸 Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)]</p><p>Write a function that converts the input to the output</p><p>I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes</p><p>How would you solve it?</p></div>— Alexey Grigorev (@Al_Grigor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor/status/1357028887209902088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2021</a></blockquote><p>Since I recently started learning Clojure, and I regularly do 4clojure exercises, this problem seemed intriguing, so I decided to try to solve it immediately. I fired up my REPL, and within several minutes i came up with:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>interleave</span><span>
 </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)))</span><span>

</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Yaay! It works! But it is not exactly what was asked for. Nor is it very ‘clean’, so to say. What bothers me the most in this solution is that i have repetitive code, so I decided to solve that with <code>let</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>
  </span><span>(</span><span>interleave</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>str</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>first</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>))</span><span>

</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Now it’s a little bit better, code-wise, but result is still not exactly right. So I decided to replace <code>interleave</code> with <code>map list</code>, since it gets us to where we need to be:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>

            </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>((</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Then I immediately realised, that it can be even better. Instead of repeating <code>map</code> twice in <code>(map str (map first x))</code>, I replaced it with <code>(map (comp str first) x)</code> and it’s little bit cleaner:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>(</span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>x</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>partition-by</span><span> </span><span>identity</span><span> </span><span>"aaaabbbcca"</span><span>)]</span><span>

              </span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span> </span><span>count</span><span> </span><span>x</span><span>)))</span><span>
</span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>((</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"b"</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"c"</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>"a"</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>))</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>And then i just put everything into a function, since the task was to make a function that can be reused. I was only left with a burden to name this function, which was conveniently named <code>chop-chop</code> :)</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Power cuts have become a common occurrence around here, under the glamorous title of “<a href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-electricity-services/Load-shedding-and-outages">load-shedding</a>“. The local electrical utility has, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis">some years, and for many historical reasons</a>, experienced periodic trouble meeting the demands placed upon the electricity network. It doesn’t happen all that often, but when it does, my area tends to go dark for about two hours, once or twice a day. This has led to a number of equipment failures; most of my equipment is behind some form of <span>UPS</span>, but most UPSes are designed to bridge less than five minutes of electrical outage, and not two&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>So, I needed something a little more beefy for all my networking and storage equipment. Lockdown&nbsp;project!</p>
<p>After about two months of research (bigger off-the-shelf <span>UPS</span>? Extension packs?), I decided that I could build my own <span>UPS</span> that would last longer and be cheaper than the alternatives available to me. The Tesla Powerwall system has spawned a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nocrf50here">homegrown</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jehugarcia">imitators</a>, and the load-shifting design of the Powerwall met my needs&nbsp;precisely.</p>
<p>Moreover, by building a <span>DC</span> <span>UPS</span>, I could skip the conversion from <span>DC</span> and back to <span>AC</span>, which seems to account for a significant amount of power draw in most off-the-shelf UPSes; since all the essential equipment runs off either 12V (in the case of the network-attached storage/<span>NAS</span> and the network hub) or 24V <span>DC</span> (for the network router), or 5V <span>DC</span> for the Raspberry Pi, there was no need for <span>AC</span> power. The system was originally designed for 12V power, and so I chose a 4S configuration for the batteries, which ended up working well, even with the late addition of 24V output. The necessary&nbsp;components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/product/4s-or-3s-12v-li-ion-or-lifepo4-battery-smart-bms-with-bluetooth-function-uart-and-rs485-communication-with-60a-to-120a-constant-current/">A battery management system</a> (<span>BMS</span>). This <span>BMS</span> handles the chosen 4S/12V configuration, has very large heat sinks, and is adjustable via Bluetooth. Having an adjustable configuration was important: I wanted to adjust the maximum and minimum battery voltages in order to prolong battery life as long as possible. (I also got the <span>RS485</span> <span>UART</span> adapter, which now reads the <span>BMS</span> state for&nbsp;Prometheus/Grafana.)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.communica.co.za/products/psu-swmmc-24v-12-5a"><span>AC</span>/<span>DC</span> adapter</a>, converting from 110/<span>220VAC</span> to <span>24VDC</span>. The one I ended up getting was pretty chunky, accepting a fairly high wattage, and including a fan for when power is drawn. I chose 24V rather than 12V because the LiFePO4 cells operate at 12.7V to 14V, so 14V is needed to ensure that the cells will take power. It was also important to ensure that the adapter couldn’t backfeed into the&nbsp;grid!</li>
<li>2 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/300w-step-down-power-module-9a/">9A/300W <span>DC</span> step-down converters</a>, one to convert incoming 24V to a 14V constant charge profile for the battery, and one to regulate outgoing power at a stable 12V for 12V equipment (as the battery voltage could vary between 12.7V for discharged 4S LiFePO4 cells, and 14V for fully charged cells). These were massively overspecced (max current draw by the <span>BMS</span> is 1.2A @ 12V) to ensure good heat&nbsp;performance.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/150w-boost-converter-dc-dc-step-up-module/">10A/150W <span>DC</span> step-up converter</a>, to convert from the battery’s 12.7-14V to a stable 24V, for powering 24V equipment. Again, overspecced for those sweet sweet&nbsp;heatsinks.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="http://www.xtcomp.co.za/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=362">3A/5V <span>DC</span>-<span>USB</span> step-down converter</a>. This was to charge cellphones in case of a power cut, but now powers a Raspberry Pi that collects stats from the <span>BMS</span> (and other networking&nbsp;tasks).</li>
<li>Copper wiring, solder, battery cell spacers, wood (for a box — I used meranti, which is sufficiently dense to increase its fire-resistance, at least in theory), connectors, terminal blocks, electrical tape, and other&nbsp;consumables.</li>
<li>And batteries! After much research, I decided to try and find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">Lithium Ferrite Phosphate</a> (LiFEPO4) cells, which have a similar price point to Lithium Ion cells, but are much safer. They have excellent characteristics for this purpose, most important of which (after safety) is that 4 groups of cells (4S) closely matched my original requirement of a 12V system. I was incredibly lucky to find cells from the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCehtnVwfWE0_OflP0dCo9pw"><span>DIY</span> Joe</a>, who had bought a large batch for his own&nbsp;projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based mostly on price, I bought 48 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18650">18650</a> 1.5A cells, for a <span>12P4S</span> (each group having 12 cells in parallel, providing 18A, with 4 groups in series) configuration, providing 72A at a nominal 3.3V, for about 230.4Wh. I had measured the power draw of all the devices I planned to run off the <span>UPS</span>, and come up with a maximum draw of 40W. So 230Wh would give me nearly 6 hours of runtime with all devices running at full power (I haven’t done a full load test yet, but in real-world conditions, I’d estimate runtime is closer to <strong>20 hours</strong>). At its worst, load shedding could be 2 hours, 3 times a day, and there is no guarantee that the time between incidents would be sufficient to fully recharge the&nbsp;cells.</p>
<p>I did quite a bit of research into the dynamics of charging LiFePO4 cells; it appears that the best charge profile is to provide constant current (<span>CC</span>) at 18A (the technical term is C/1; C is the amperage of each group of parallel cells, in this case 18A) until the cell group reaches a charge of 3.6V, and then to provide constant voltage (<span>CV</span>) at 3.6V until the battery is pulling C/24 of current, or 0.75A (some sources say you can stuff your cells to the metaphorical gills, until they can’t take more than C/12, or 0.5A, of current; others offer the more conservative cut-off of C/20, or&nbsp;0.9A).</p>
<p>However, I am not trying to saturate my cells: this is a (hopefully) long-lived and large-celled <span>UPS</span>, not a drone that needs as much power as you can cram into it! So I planned to cut off the charge at the relatively conservative 3.5V (I have since reduced this further to 3.45V), and entirely skip the <span>CV</span> step. In principle, increasing the minimum voltage and reducing the maximum voltage should result in vastly increased lifespan for the battery. So I would adjust the minimum voltage (the point at which the <span>BMS</span> refuses to provide any more power from the cells) on the <span>BMS</span> from 2.7V to 3.175V, and decrease the maximum voltage (the charge cutoff) from 3.65V to&nbsp;3.45V.</p>
<p>The rest of the important values work backwards from this: if we want to charge 3.65V at 18A, we need a charger and <span>BMS</span> that can cope with 65.7W; I picked a 300W charger, and a <span>BMS</span> that maxes out at 120A (so about 6.6 times larger than neccessary: the shipping was sufficiently expensive that it made more sense to get the best <span>BMS</span> I&nbsp;could).</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>By early March, I had my cells; I had not yet ordered the <span>BMS</span> or chargers. Of course, at this point, lockdown intervened; I could only order the parts in June! Even if I had ordered in March, it wouldn’t have arrived any sooner than it did, in&nbsp;July.</p>
<p>However, that did at least give me time to unbundle the <span>3P1S</span> units that the batteries arrived in, and repackage them into 4 sets of 12, using battery spacers to keep each set&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>At this stage, I made the biggest mistake of the build: cutting away too much of the existing spot-welded tin strips that connected the three cells together. (Happily by the time I got to the second set of cells, I had learnt my lesson.) Batteries don’t react well to heat, so the best method of wiring up 18650s is to spot weld them with tin strips, which applies a huge amount of heat very quickly. Sadly, I don’t have a spot welder, so it was plain old solder (plus a bit of flux) for me. The remaining tin on the last three sets of batteries was enough to mediate the heat of the solder (and provide a stable base for the solder, so the wires were less likely to disconnect as I progressed and require re-soldering), but the first set, to this day, doesn’t charge quite as well as the other&nbsp;three.</p>

<figcaption>
The repackaged cells; the first set of cells that I opened is on the lower left, and lacks the spot-welded tin on the terminals. I also used red and black insulation tape to mark the positive and negative terminals (as the spacers hide the tiny ridge that is the only other indicator) and to reinforce the existing heat-shrink; the blue insulation tape around the middle of each group (only on the first group in this photo) reinforced the joins on the spacers.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, by mid-June, I was able to place orders for the remaining equipment; most of the items arrived at the end of July. Unfortunately, by this point, I was so eager to get started that photos are few and far in&nbsp;between.</p>
<p>The next step was to wire together the groups of cells into a more permanent 4S configuration. I used fairly thick twisted copper wire as bus bars, with individual strands of copper to each wire, to act as a cheap fuse in case of over-current. (It works quite well; my testing was inadvertent but happily did not set fire to anything, damage any cells, or result in emergency room visits. It also confirmed my fire-proofing safety calculations: well worth the momentary&nbsp;clumsiness!)</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having wired in the bus bars, I needed to connect the balance cables, which allow the BMs to detect and balance the voltage/charge of each group. Three of the wires go between each group (the white ones), the red and black go at the positive and negative terminal. Since a short-circuit of two 18A cells would be a powerful thing, I added a wooden spacer between the two sets of cells, to ensure that bus bars that should not touch stayed far&nbsp;apart.</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Originally, I had arranged the bus bars to ensure that current went in one side (say, top left) and connected to the next cell on the opposite side (bottom right, in this example). This was to ensure that the current went through all the cells approximately&nbsp;evenly.</p>
<p>Later testing suggested that the copper bus bars that I was using weren’t enough to properly balance the batteries (although this may have simply been the use of a single negative wire to the <span>BMS</span>), so I ended up connecting the second row of bus bars, and adding a second set of positive and negative&nbsp;terminals.</p>
<p>In this photo, the terminals have lugs attached; lacking a proper crimping tool for these lugs, I eventually discarded the lugs and switched to using regular terminal blocks, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>About a year ago I quit my job to attempt my startup idea (<a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>), writing it in Haskell. One key decision to make was what cloud provider would I go with.</p>

<p>Like many developers, I have a bunch of professional experience developing against Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Haskell community seems to reflect wider industry in that AWS is by far the most popular choice. In fact, myself and a colleague had already managed to get <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/blog/a-haskell-in-prod-journey/">Haskell running in prod on AWS</a> and it was great.</p>

<p>However, I’ve always been in awe of Google products and wanted to try out Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I decided this would be a good opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>tl;dr - Haskell on GCP is great. GCP vs AWS has various trade offs, however I think there are a few reasons why GCP is great for Haskell.</p>

<p>First let’s look at using Haskell on AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws--haskell">AWS + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="aws-haskell-library-support">AWS Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>AWS has the excellent <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka"><code>amazonka</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. This is actually a large set of libraries that support the many many AWS services. The bulk of the libraries are generated from AWS service definitions and thus can easily be kept up to date.</p>

<h3 id="aws-docker-options">AWS Docker Options</h3>

<p>Haskell works really well with Docker. You can build executables with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell/">official Haskell images</a>. Then simply embed them in plain old Debain based containers. AWS has numerous Docker based options and they work great.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> allows you to run a function in the cloud without having to worry about how it is hosted, or how it integrates with other AWS services. With a bit of config you can configure a whole host of integrations or scaling options and AWS will make it happen.</p>

<p>Lambda is somewhat controversial among developers in my experience. It doesn’t always live up to its motto of <code>Run code without thinking about servers or clusters</code>. Nonetheless, I think it does have a good niche and can be very useful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Haskell is not directly supported by Lambda. It does support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">custom runtimes</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hal">there</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell">are</a> <a href="https://theam.github.io/aws-lambda-haskell-runtime/">tools</a> for using Haskell on Lambda.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I have not actually used these Haskell on Lambda solutions, but I believe they take more manual effort to set up and use. This to my mind takes away a lot of the simplicity benefits of using Lambda.</p>

<h2 id="gcp--haskell">GCP + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="gcp-haskell-library-support">GCP Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>Likewise, GCP has the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gogol"><code>gogol</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. <code>gogol</code> has the disadvantage that it is a bit less popular (like GCP) than <code>amazonka</code> and is thus a bit less actively maintained. Still, there is nothing preventing you from regenerating the libraries and using them as required. I did this recently to gain support for a new google service.</p>

<p>Overall GCP vs AWS here is mostly moot.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-docker-options">GCP Docker Options</h3>

<p>GCP also has many good solutions with Docker and they work great with Haskell.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-run">Google Cloud Run</h3>

<p>The equivalent of AWS Lambda on GCP is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">cloud functions</a>. Cloud functions has much of the same limitations as Lambda and additionally has no custom runtime concept. Haskell cannot run on cloud functions, so a negative strike there.</p>

<p>However, GCP has another service, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">cloud run</a>, which could be thought of as <code>AWS Lambda for Docker</code> and is a sweet spot for a niche language like Haskell. You use it by providing a docker container that listens on a port for HTTP requests. You can integrate it with other GCP services to automatically make those requests, then your API just needs to decode (with help from <code>gogol</code>) and handle them.</p>

<p>For example in my usage I have a pipeline of cloud run services connected with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">pub sub</a> (similar to AWS kinesis). I do not need any code to have new messages appear as HTTP requests to cloud run.</p>

<p>Additionally, your cloud run services can simply be HTTP APIs, without using any of the integration glue that GCP offers. So it does some of what Lambda does while also being a simple solution to host standalone APIs.</p>

<p>Cloud run is great, especially for niche languages like Haskell. Unlike AWS Lambda Haskell does not become a second class citizen.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-kubernetes">What About Kubernetes?</h4>

<p>Kubernetes sounds cool, but I think it is a complex solution for a complex problem. If you need this complexity Haskell will work nicely, of course. However, I think for most use cases cloud run is the better, simpler choice.</p>

<h3 id="comprehensive-platform-with-vendor-lock-in">Comprehensive Platform (with vendor lock in)</h3>

<p>This one is based on my impressions and I find it hard to include clear examples. Take this with a grain of salt 😉.</p>

<p>GCP more so than AWS seems to focus on fewer, more developed first party products. AWS on the other hand has more products, particularly more managed third party products. As such, on AWS you are probably going to supplement the AWS platform with these third party tools.</p>

<p>Why does this matter to Haskell?</p>

<p>While you are sticking to the core AWS / GCP platform, you know you have excellent library support with <code>amazonka</code> / <code>gogol</code>. When using third party product X, library support can be patchy. GCP helps you avoid this problem with more of a chance of sticking entirely to the GCP platform.</p>

<p>This comes with vendor lock in concerns, but beggars can’t be choosers 😉.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-is-cheap">GCP Is Cheap</h3>

<p>To my mind most Haskell shops are small to medium sized. At this size I think the cost of cloud resources is more of a factor. GCP is cheaper than AWS, particularly for small shops or startups (in my experience).</p>

<p>One reason for this is most of their services include a free tier that you need to exceed before having to pay anything. Cloud run for example, has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing">2 million free requests per month (and other free tier limits you may hit)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deadpendency-architecture">Deadpendency Architecture</h3>

<p>I am working on chopping out a nice skeleton architecture of how I deploy and use GCP for <a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>. I hope this will be valuable to others and lower the barrier of using Haskell on GCP and cloud run. Coming soon™️ 😅.</p>

<h2 id="gcp-downsides">GCP Downsides</h2>

<p>So perhaps at this point you’re really keen to start using Haskell on GCP. There are a couple of downsides to GCP when compared to AWS it is good to be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-as-code">Deployment As Code</h3>

<p>To me the killer feature of AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">Cloud Formation</a>. GCP has an equivalent in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager">Cloud Deployment Manager</a>, however it is (or was 1 year ago when I tried it) greatly inferior to cloud formation.</p>

<p>This isn’t the end of the world though. It just means <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> is essential on GCP. Terraform has a learning curve and is another abstraction layer to learn, but does also bring some benefits with the complexity. Additionally, Google and Terraform themselves maintain the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest">terraform google ‘provider’</a> so it is quite high quality and up to date.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-less-popular">It Is Less Popular</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">GCP is growing faster than AWS</a> in terms of percentage year on year revenue growth. However, <a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">AWS is currently 32% of the market, while GCP is only 7%</a>. As Haskellers we know well the costs of using niche languages and products. It is manageable, but you can expect it harder to find answers to your random error message etc.</p>

<p>One nice thing is there are some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/community#home-support">good free channels</a> to get help from GCP employees.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Haskell runs great in Docker and has great library support for AWS and GCP. As such, Haskell can work well on both of them.</p>

<p>However, GCP has a few advantages, in particular cloud run is excellent for hosting APIs or gluing together pipelines with Haskell. I would strongly recommend considering it if you do Haskell, rather than just automatically reaching for AWS 😀.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>tâ€™s 2050 and youâ€™re due for your monthly physical exam. Times have changed, so you no longer have to endure an orifices check, a needle in your vein, and a week of waiting for your blood test results. Instead, the nurse welcomes you with, â€œThe doctor will sniff you now,â€� and takes you into an airtight chamber wired up to a massive computer. As you rest, the volatile molecules you exhale or emit from your body and skin slowly drift into the complex artificial intelligence apparatus, colloquially known as Deep Nose. Behind the scene, Deep Noseâ€™s massive electronic brain starts crunching through the molecules, comparing them to its enormous olfactory database. Once itâ€™s got a noseful, the AI matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them and generates a printout of your health. Your human doctor goes over the results with you and plans your treatment or adjusts your meds.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s how Alexei Koulakov, a researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>, who studies how the human olfactory system works, envisions one possible future of our healthcare. A physicist turned neuroscientist, Koulakov is working to understand how humans perceive odors and to classify millions of volatile molecules by their â€œsmellableâ€� properties. He plans to catalogue the existing smells into a comprehensive artificial intelligence network. Once built, Deep Nose will be able to identify the odors of a person or any other olfactory bouquet of interest—for medical or other reasons. â€œIt will be a chip that can diagnose or identify you,â€� Koulakov says. Scent uniquely identifies a person or merchandise, so Deep Nose can also help at the border patrol, sniffing travelers, cargo, or explosives. â€œInstead of presenting passports at the airport, you would just present yourself.â€� And doctorâ€™s visits would become a breeze—literally.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_767471bfa3f2088e16d8d3594fb77137.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 2.25.47 AM"><figcaption><span><strong>ODOR &amp; HOOCH: </strong>Peer-reviewed studies show dogs can be trained to detect signature scents of diseases, including cancer and tuberculosis. But in the long run, a â€œsniffingâ€� computer would be more economical and effective. </span><br><span>aswphotos / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>W</span>hat can oneâ€™s odor tell about oneâ€™s health? Apparently, a lot. â€œThe information that can be picked up from the airborne molecules is amazingly rich,â€� says Dmitry Rinberg, also a former physicist and now a neurobiologist at New York University who collaborates with Koulakov on olfactory research. â€œItâ€™s so informative that you can tell what kind of beer people drank at a bar last night.â€� Odor can reveal other things happening with the body, he adds. â€œSo we are trying to use this information for odor-based diagnostic approaches.â€�</p>
<p>Recent research finds that many diseases, including cancer, tuberculosis, and Parkinsonâ€™s, can manifest themselves through volatile compounds that change the personâ€™s scent. Our bodies release certain metabolites—products of our metabolic activities. Some of these molecules are volatiles and become part of our scent, or â€œodorprint.â€� When we become sick or start developing a disease, our metabolic processes start functioning differently, emitting different volatile molecules or mixtures of them, so our odorprint changes too. â€œThese molecules carry information about our state of health,â€� Koulakov says. For example, patients with Parkinson disease produce an unusually high amount of sebum,<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;a waxy lipid-rich biofluid excreted by the sebaceous glands of the skin, which sensitive noses can detect. Deep Nose could grab this information from the thin air. That could allow physicians to detect disease sooner, easier, and perhaps avoid some invasive diagnostic procedures. â€œIt would essentially revolutionize the diagnostics system,â€� Koulakov says.</p>
<blockquote><em>Deep Nose matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them.</em></blockquote>
<p>Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicenna, and other physicians of ancient times used their noses as diagnostic tools. A wound with a nasty smell could mean it was infected. And bad breath signaled a host of ailments. Today, however, physicians donâ€™t sniff their patients—because humans generally stink at smelling. In fact, we are worse than our ancestors. Our primate predecessors sported about 850 olfactory receptor types, but we retained only 350 functioning ones, which in various combinations allow us to smell an astronomical amount of odors. (The rest of them simply donâ€™t work. â€œThey are the remnants of our former glory,â€� Koulakov quips.) Meanwhile, dogs have about 850 receptor types and mice about 1,100 or 1,200, so they are capable of discerning a much greater variety of smells—including those produced by the malfunctions of our bodies.
</p>
<p>Scientists now use that animal olfactory wealth to diagnose disease—with some documented success and peer-reviewed studies. Recently, a group of scientists from several research institutions presented their results of training three beagles to sniff patientsâ€™ blood samples and detect lung cancer cells in them with 97 percent accuracy.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A study published in&nbsp;<em>British Medical Journal</em>&nbsp;stated that dogs were able to detect colorectal cancer by smelling stool.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Another paper in&nbsp;<em>BMC Cancer</em>&nbsp;described dogs smelling out ovarian cancer.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And African giant pouched rats had been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticiansâ€� in Sub-Saharan Africa, sniffing sputum samples from patients. Microscope detection accuracy can vary from about 20 to 80 percent. The ratsâ€™ noses helped improve detection by up to 44 percent.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>But animal diagnosticians have their problems. First, they must be trained, and training large numbers of animals that donâ€™t live very long is expensive, time-consuming, and somewhat futile. Plus, every time youâ€™d want to add yet another disease scent to their analytic arsenal, youâ€™d have to train all of them again. â€œThe use of animals for actual diagnostics is very limited,â€� Rinberg says.</p>
<p>That led scientists to ponder the possibility of an electronic nose instead. It would be far more economical to build an artificial sniffer apparatus that wouldnâ€™t die after a few years, with standard software that can be updated regularly across all the board. And thatâ€™s how Koulakov envisions Deep Nose—an electronic olfactory AI that can function as a nose that picks up scents and as a brain that interprets them. That, of course, is no easy feat. Deep Nose is modeled after the neuro-machinery of the human brain, but scientists have yet to figure out how the human brain identifies one scent from another.</p>

<p><span>B</span>iologically, the act of smelling is more complex and less understood than our ability to see. Recognizing a scent is a precise and intricate process in which chemistry, biology, and physics must play together in a synchronized concerto—whether youâ€™re relishing the aroma of a rose or pinching your nose at a pile of dog poop.</p>
<p>Inside your nasal cavity, millions of olfactory neurons are waiting for the next smelly molecule to fly in. These neurons have microscopic finger-like protrusions called cilia, which float in the mucus covering the surface of the nasal epithelium. The neuronsâ€™ other ends, called axons, stretch upward, passing through special passages inside the skull all the way to the brain, leading to the region called the olfactory bulb, named so for its onion-like shape. When molecules fly into our nose, they bind to the cilia, and the neurons send this information to the olfactory bulb, which interprets it, resulting in our sensation of the smell. It would also pass these signals to the olfactory cortex, whose neuro-machinery would determine the quality and the concentration of the smells.</p>

Darker red colors correspond to more activity. </span><br><span>Courtesy of Dr. Hiro Nalkayama, Rinberg Lab, NYU Neuroscience Institute</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some molecules bind to certain receptors but not to others. Depending on the specific combination of receptors the molecules lock onto, we would smell roses or dog poop. But even that seemingly simple molecular handshake remains mysterious. Some scientists believe in the â€œsteric binding theory,â€� which states that the molecules fit receptorsâ€™ distinct physical shapes. Others support the â€œvibrational theoryâ€� that purports that olfactory receptors detect the moleculesâ€™ vibrational frequency and â€œtranslateâ€� them into odors. â€œThe steric theory suggests that there is a binding pocket of a particular shape, and some molecules will fit there, while others may swim away in the mucus,â€� Koulakov says.<br></p>
<p>Regardless of which theory proves correct, Deep Nose builders still face a huge challenge. The nose part, which would mimic the neuronal binding action, will require chemical sensors. These sensors will interact with the flying molecules—whether by binding or a different method—and detect their presence. The sensors will then send electrical signals to the electronic brain—the Deep Nose network that will interpret what molecules have been detected. Koulakov envisions it functioning as a network of multiple layers that will be able to recognize different parts of the molecules and different chemical groups within them—just like different neurons react to the presence of different molecules inside biological brains.</p>
<blockquote><em>Dogs have been taught to smell cancer and rats have been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticians.â€�</em></blockquote>
<p>Luckily, researchers can see how that neuronal activity happens inside living brains. Modern technology allows one to peek inside the brain, seeing what olfactory receptors activate in response to what odors. That requires brain surgery and genetic manipulation, so itâ€™s not possible to do in people, but mice and rats can help. Thatâ€™s where Rinbergâ€™s lab comes in. His team uses genetically modified mice whose olfactory neurons are tinted with fluorescent …</p></article></div>

</p></div><h2>Elastic License v2
</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license">Elastic License v2 (ELv2)</a> is a very simple, non-copyleft license, allowing for the right to "use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software” and has only three high-level limitations. You cannot:
</p><ol><li>Provide the products to others as a managed service&nbsp;</li><li>Circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys&nbsp;</li><li>Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices</li></ol><p>ELv2 applies to all of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It covers the distribution as well as the source code of all free and paid features.<br></p><p>We share our source code for both free and paid features in the spirit of openness. Unfortunately, our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">copyrights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">trademarks</a> have been abused and misused. Our goal with this updated license is to be as permissive as possible while including a minimum set of protections. I hope these protections make sense. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq">See our FAQ</a> for more information about ELv2.
</p><div><p>We created ELv2 to hopefully allow others to adopt it. This is the license we wished was available in 2015 when we were a small company facing <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">misinformation</a>. It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.
</p><h2>Still no impact to our cloud and on-premises customers&nbsp;
</h2><p>It is important to repeat: there is no impact to any of our Elastic Cloud or self-managed customers. Our customers already use the default distribution under the Elastic License, and their use is governed by the terms of their subscription agreement, which continues to grant them access to additional features, access to support, and other Elastic commitments (for example, IP infringement indemnification) as before.
</p><h2>The path forward
</h2><p>These changes, including making the Elastic License more permissive, are intended to help us focus on building great products and investing in our community. This means building more great features, many of which we will provide for free and which will be developed in the open. But our commitment goes beyond the code. These license changes let us focus on what matters: helping you find success with our products.

<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – February 4th, 2021 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA has demonstrated widespread adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity to <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">graduate</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">OPA</a> is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack. The project was accepted into the CNCF sandbox in April 2018 and one year later was promoted to incubation. More than 90 individuals from approximately 30 organizations contribute to OPA, and maintainers come from four organizations, including Google, Microsoft, VMware, and Styra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the cloud native ecosystem grows, it’s more important than ever for organizations to have access to policy enforcement tools built for modern cloud native deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Since joining CNCF, OPA has expanded to integrate closer with Kubernetes via the Gatekeeper project but also supports a wide variety of use cases outside of Kubernetes.”</p>



<p>The project has been adopted widely in production by organizations like Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Pinterest, T-Mobile, and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">many others</a>. According to a <a href="https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/open-policy-agent-survey-summary-spring-2020-adaa46e61f0">recent OPA user survey</a> of more than 150 organizations, 91% indicated they use OPA in some stage of OPA adoption from QA to production. More than half indicated they use OPA for at least two use cases. The most common use cases for OPA are configuration authorization (such as Kubernetes admission control) and API authorization. The project has successfully integrated with several CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, Envoy, CoreDNS, Helm, SPIFFE/SPIRE, and more. It also integrates with Gatekeeper to provide a Kubernetes-native experience for admission policy enforcement and auditing.</p>



<p>“When we started OPA, we knew that policy and authorization were going to become more critical than ever, due to heterogeneous and complex app deployments,” said Torin Sandall, OPA co-founder and VP of Open Source at Styra. “We also knew we’d need the support of the community for integrations, performance, and knowledge-sharing. It’s thanks to this amazing group of folks that OPA today has become a graduated project and the de facto toolset and framework for expressing authorization policy across the stack.”</p>



<p>During its time in the CNCF incubator, OPA underwent two external security audits, the results of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here </a>and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here</a>, and OPA completed the SIG-Security <a href="https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/assessments/projects/opa">assessment process</a>. The team has defined a <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY.md">security vulnerability disclosure process</a> and a security response team, which includes individuals from three current maintainer organizations.</p>



<p>“Thanks to OPA’s streamlined policy language, I can take policies that would otherwise require dozens of lines of code, and instead write them in just five or six lines. This means I was able to—literally overnight—take all of our existing policies and transition them to OPA,” said Joe Searcy, Member of Technical Staff, Distributed Systems at T-Mobile. “OPA policies are significantly faster to create, easier to maintain, and can be applied throughout our stack. We’ve reached the point that anytime, and with any new project, when we think about policy we automatically turn to Open Policy Agent.”</p>



<p>“Extensibility is really important to us, because we knew from the start that we’d be using OPA as part of a larger ecosystem, built into other code,” said Chris Stivers, Principle Engineer, PaaS, at Atlassian. “The community, the integrations, and the performance were what reassured us that OPA would meet our needs at Atlassian.”</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project was certified for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1768">CII Best Practices Badge</a>, completed security audits and addressed vulnerabilities, defined its own <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a>, and adopted the <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building Ditto, we've gotten the chance to talk to 200+ teams about what the process of collaborating on copy looks like for them.</p><p>Our key finding? Copy is end-to-end — it exists from the early phases of discovery and design all the way to development.</p><p>This means that working on copy doesn't just involve writers drafting text on their own. It's the back-and-forth between designers and writers about how copy and visuals can work together. It's conversations with PMs to understand the goals of a new feature and what language will help users navigate successfully. It's working with legal to get a particular term approved for use, or talking to brand about how to name a new feature. It's getting copy translated and following up to fix phrases that are too long in another language. It's handing copy off to developers and making sure it gets into production error-free. It's developers sifting through hardcoded strings when copy already in production needs to get updated.</p><p>In other words, the process of getting copy written and in front of users relies on a <em>lot</em> of people.</p><p>On most teams, though, this process is still fragmented and unreliable. And though we're seeing companies realize how impactful copy is on user experience and business goals, most still have a long way to go in embedding copy into their product development workflows.</p><p>In almost all of our conversations, we heard the same challenges come up:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>How do we integrate copy into the design process?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we manage stakeholder feedback and review of copy?</strong></li><li><strong>What's the best way to hand copy off to developers?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we establish lasting copy consistency across our product?</strong></li></ol><p>In this post, we're sharing what we've learned about the state of copy workflows from our conversations: the issues that teams are currently facing and strategies they've come up with for tackling them.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>1. Integrating copy into the design process</p>
</div><p>Copy is as much a part of the user experience as the layout and the visuals. But translating this into your product development process — making sure that copy and visual design evolve together — is tricky. Visuals often get prioritized over copy, and some words inevitably end up getting written last-minute, in a mad dash to replace lingering <em>lorem ipsums.</em></p><p>Part of the reason is that design and copy often don't share a toolset. Designers work in their design tools, but copy can exist in any number of places (think: external copy docs and spreadsheets, design tools, Jira, Slack, email). Between the annotated screenshots being messaged back-and-forth in Slack and copy tables in word documents, copy ends up increasingly detached from its goal of designing for users.<br>‍</p><p><strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>From our conversations, we've learned a few tips for fostering more effective copy-design collaboration:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Think about copy early on.</strong> Copy is an integral part of the user experience and should be part of the decision-making process from the start. This means thinking about copy even when the design problem is still being framed and user goals are still being established. Copy is more than just the words that eventually end up in the design. Understanding what content a user needs to feel reassured or successfully complete a task can inform the structure of a user flow or even highlight UI issues.<br>In practice, this can look like a few different things: Try designing with real content from the very beginning, and consider mapping out the flow and structure of copy <em>before</em> you start on the visuals. If your company has a dedicated content team, make sure they're kept in the loop on upcoming projects, whether that means inviting them to meetings or sending over post-kickoff notes.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Take an overhead view on copy.</strong> As with visual design, successful copy requires thinking about the product as a whole. Consider how the text in one part of the product will interact with copy that already exists elsewhere. Think about how copy for a particular feature fits into the overarching journey of what else a user is reading and experiencing. See if you can reuse copy (more on this below!) to maintain consistency and overall usability across surfaces of the product.</li><li><strong>Make sure the mockups have up-to-date copy.</strong> This ensures that the text and visuals on a design are continuously aligned.</li></ul><p>For teams with dedicated content roles like UX writers and content designers:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Try using collaborative design tools (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.).</strong> Writers will be able to work side-by-side with designers, edit directly in the mockups, try out variations, and view changes in realtime. Just make sure to establish a clear process for how writers should work out of the design files. For example, if a mockup is particularly complex, this could mean creating a separate page in the file just for writers to play around with copy.</li><li><strong>Define a method for giving status updates</strong>. If writers are working directly out of the design file, it can be tricky to know what copy is final and what's not. Try indicating status in the file itself (ex: colored badges), or deciding on one communication tool like Slack.</li><li><strong>Determine what level of content work each project requires.</strong> While copy is important on every project, it'll be more important on some than others. Chances are, content designers will be supporting many teams at once, so prioritization is key. For writers, establish a process for receiving requests for copy help (we've heard Airtable or Google Forms work well!), and feel free to push back on "quick" requests when you don't have the bandwidth. Try building up a database of reusable text (more on this below) so designers can self-serve.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><div><p>2. Managing stakeholder feedback and review</p>
</div><p>Part of what makes collaborating on copy challenging is the number of stakeholders involved — almost every role at a company, from writers and designers to engineers, PMs, and legal, can touch the copy during any one project.</p><p>Compared to traditional content marketing workflows, product copy review is less linear and more iterative, relying on back-and-forth discussions more than explicit approvals. While compliance and brand teams may give one-and-done responses, folks like product owners and engineers are much more likely to give ongoing feedback as the design evolves.</p><p>Even more, every project involves different stakeholders who each have a set of tools they're comfortable with. For every team we talked to, copy review took place in some combination of the following places:</p><ul role="list"><li>Design tools (ex: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Abstract)</li><li>Spreadsheets and documents (ex: Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable)</li><li>Communication tools (ex: Slack, email)</li><li>Project management tools (ex: Jira, Trello, Confluence)</li><li>Codebase + code management tools (ex: Github, Bitbucket)</li></ul><p>When some comments are added to Google Docs and others to an email thread, and the copy in mockups differs from that in the spreadsheet, stakeholders don't know where to find the most recent discussions or even version of copy. Tool overload makes it difficult to find alignment and make decisions, ultimately slowing the entire team down.</p><p>Beyond setting up a repeatable process for getting feedback, there are also challenges with getting the right feedback at the right time. Stakeholders (who usually aren't involved from the very beginning of the project) have to get up-to-speed on context — what this copy looks like in the design, where it sits in the UX flow, what the overarching project business and user goals are. Stakeholders also often have the mentality that "anyone can write," which can lead to unsolicited suggestions or unproductive feedback loops.</p><p><strong><br>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are a few ways we've heard teams combat these issues:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Designate a single source of truth for all the copy in your project, and enforce that!</strong> Make sure it's kept up-to-date with the latest copy so everyone can stay on the same page. Limit all copy-related discussion to this source of truth, and make sure it's easily accessible by stakeholders. It should also allow you to easily track progress, record iterations, and document who's making changes and the rationale behind those decisions.</li><li><strong>Ensure stakeholders get the context they need off-the-bat.</strong> This could mean linking documentation in the request for review, hopping on a brief call to fill them in, or recording a video walkthrough of the flow. Whenever possible, present copy with visual context. It can also be helpful include what stage the copy is at (was it just drafted, or has it already been rewritten and reviewed by three other teams?) so you get the correct level of feedback.</li><li><strong>Build up relationships with stakeholders</strong>. Sync regularly with key stakeholders, and start to understand their challenges and definitions of success. Look for shared goals and opportunities to advocate for copy and its impact on business and user experience across different parts of the company. Whenever possible, measure copy ROI, tie those to business outcomes, and share those wins so stakeholders are more likely to give copy a seat at the table.</li></ul><p>👉 <em>At Ditto, we're helping teams </em><a href="http://bit.ly/ditto-workflow-single-source" target="_blank"><em>create a single source of truth</em></a><em> for all of their product copy.</em></p><p>‍</p><div><p>3.

<![CDATA[Proactive versus Reactive Teams]]>

February 4, 2021 | https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/01/10/proactive-vs-reactive-teams.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://staysaasy.com/management/2021/01/10/proactive-vs-reactive-teams.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most important dimensions on which teams differ is the degree to which they’re proactive vs. reactive.</p>

<p>Proactive teams operate primarily by strategizing, and then methodically executing on their plans. Think of teams such as User Research which conduct research and synthesize it into results, ideally building repeatable frameworks and reusable outputs along the way.</p>

<p>Reactive teams operate by rapidly assessing, deciding, and executing on new needs, typically due to external factors. They often follow playbooks for efficiency purposes, and are skilled at responding rapidly to changing information. They favor quick-thinking and the ability to juggle multiple competing priorities.</p>

<p>At a technology company, Design is the team that I usually think of as the most proactive. There are never really “Design Emergencies,” and even typing that phrase feels weird. Content Marketing is another example – it’s very rare that the business urgently requires a thought leadership piece. On the most reactive end of the spectrum are teams such as Support or Customer Success which need to respond to customers situations. These teams live in reaction-land, and need to quickly think on their feet and contend with unpredictable workloads.</p>

<p>Most teams fall somewhere in the middle. For example, much of the work that a PR team does is proactive, such as placing stories and building industry relationships. But there are also PR emergencies that demand immediate reaction – if your CEO gets indicted, your PR team doesn’t just get to go home at 5pm. Many enterprise SaaS teams such as Revenue Operations also fall in the middle. The day-to-day of a RevOps team consists of many reactive steps to advance ongoing deal cycles, but these teams also do the proactive work of mapping sales territories, setting up Salesforce processes, and more.</p>

<p>The most important factors to consider on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reactive work tends to happen right where you make money: making customers happy, selling new deals, or doing damage control (eg, to keep the servers running or combat a PR issue). <em>If you aren’t sufficiently reactive, you will let the business down.</em></li>
  <li>Your ability to scale as a department will largely be driven by proactive steps that you take to add efficiency. <em>If you aren’t sufficiently proactive, you won’t be able to level up and scale.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-your-team-be-proactive-or-reactive">Should Your Team Be Proactive or Reactive?</h2>

<p>Given that businesses demand varying levels of reactivity from teams, and that proactively improving processes is how you scale, it’s imperative to know how you should balance your time.</p>

<p>If you’re a Support team and try to dedicate 70% of your Support reps’ time to scaling, you’ll quickly let down your customers. Indexing too hard on proactive work and allowing reactive work to languish leads to the type of leaders who self-brand as “visionaries” with lots of good ideas, but who ultimately fail because they can’t keep the lights on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your Product Management team spends 70% of its time reacting to the latest customer request, you’ll build a terrible product. This leads to the opposite case – great tactical leaders who get lots of small incremental wins, but who ultimately can’t scale their organizations to the next level of growth because they never identify step-function improvements to their organization.</p>

<p>As a result, the first thing to keep in mind about the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive dimension is that you need to figure out where on the spectrum your team should ideally fall. I’ve made a horrifically ugly graphic below to help illustrate this:</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/proactive_reactive/proactive-reactive.png" alt="The proactive <> reactive spectrum"></p>

<h2 id="establishing-your-spot-on-the-spectrum">Establishing Your Spot on the Spectrum</h2>

<p>Once you know where on the spectrum your team should fall, you need to take practical steps to gain and maintain that position in a scalable way.</p>

<p>For example, product, engineering, and design teams are ideally joined at the hip and operate more like a single function than a set of disparate departments. My favorite example: I view it as one of the key roles of a successful product management function to enable engineering to operate with the right level of proactivity. There are a few ways that this works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By laying out a well-prioritized and explainable roadmap, you buffer engineering and design teams from switching projects all the time when a new customer need or executive opinion arises.</li>
  <li>By working with design to set up a solid product development lifecycle, you prevent engineers from needing to react to changing requirements as features are being built.</li>
  <li>By hiring people with strong communication skills, you can help engineering with communications and more quickly resolve their most painful reactive needs: for example, responding to production incidents or customer questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are a number of different techniques to maintain your desired zone on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highly reactive teams can add a more proactive muscle by carving out explicit, defensible time for leveling up their operations. For example, establish a single goal per month/quarter (“revamp the performance management and compensation process”) and make sure that you defend this one beachhead vigorously. This proactive time should remain inviolate for everything but the largest emergencies.</li>
  <li>Conversely, proactive teams can use techniques such as on-call rotations to serve as a reactive buffer for an otherwise proactive organization. This prevents ad hoc needs from creating inefficiencies when a team focused on long-term projects constantly has bits and pieces of attention chipped away without a triage process.</li>
  <li>Setting clear expectations can go a long way as well. For example, you should tell a Customer Success Manager, Account Executive, or Site Reliability Engineer that they’ll be expected to work late if an urgent customer issue arises (and of course these teams should be compensated appropriately). By contrast, you should set the expectation with your Product Managers that they can’t react and change course with every new piece of customer feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-spectrum-determines-how-teams-collaborate">The Spectrum Determines How Teams Collaborate</h2>

<p>And finally, once you’ve gotten your own house in order, you should consider the proactive/reactive spectrum in how you work with <em>other</em> teams. Team interactions work best when you understand how other teams operate, and design collaboration accordingly.</p>

<p>The degree to which a team is proactive or reactive will dominate its operating rhythm. For example, if you’re working with a Design team, you should expect them to be highly proactive and have detailed long-term plans. It’s best to get alignment and long-term ownership for what you need done so that they can work it into their multi-quarter or even multi-year vision for the future evolution of your product. Conversely, if you need to work with a Support team, they can probably help you with anything that you need on short notice but will likely not have the ability to commit to multi-year plans the way that a Product or Design team might.</p>

<p>Understanding the dynamics of how teams naturally operate can help big cross-team projects get done more efficiently, which is one of the hardest challenges at a startup. By considering where you need to fall on this spectrum, and defending your place there, you can help your team operate more effectively with minimal drama.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All teams naturally fall on a spectrum of reactive to proactive – you need to understand your position.</li>
  <li>If you’re too reactive, you’ll never level up and scale. If you’re too proactive, you won’t respond sufficiently well to business-critical needs.</li>
  <li>Use techniques like explicit time carve outs (to be more proactive), on-call rotations (to be more reactive), and good expectation setting to defend your spot on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive continuum.</li>
  <li>For best results, consider other teams’ place on the spectrum when collaborating.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Takeaway Tuesday</strong> on <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/3iNJMXP">On Old Age</a></strong> (De Senectute) by <strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/cicero-everitt/">Cicero</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero">Marcus Tullius Cicero</a></strong>&nbsp;was a Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic. His writings include books on rhetoric, orations, philosophical and political treatises, and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator.</p><h2>1. Old age is not unique in being burdensome…</h2><blockquote><p>I think, my friends, that you marvel at a thing really far from difficult. <strong>For to those who have not the means within themselves of a virtuous and happy life every age is burdensome</strong>; and, on the other hand, to those who seek all good from themselves nothing can seem evil that the laws of nature inevitably impose. <strong>To this class old age especially belongs, which all men wish to attain and yet reproach when attained; such is the inconsistency and perversity of Folly!</strong></p><p>They say that it stole upon them faster than they had expected. In the first place, who has forced them to form a mistaken judgement? For how much more rapidly does old age steal upon youth than youth upon childhood? And again, how much less burdensome would old age be to them if they were in their eight hundredth rather than in their eightieth year? <strong>In fact, no lapse of time, however long, once it had slipped away, could solace or soothe a foolish old age</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>2. … but it is only praiseworthy if the life preceding it was well spent…</h2><blockquote><p>But bear well in mind that in this entire discussion <strong>I am praising that old age which has its foundation well laid in youth</strong>. Hence it follows— as I once said with the approval of all who heard it— that that old age is wretched which needs to defend itself with words! Nor can wrinkles and grey hair suddenly seize upon influence; <strong>but when the preceding part of life has been nobly spent, old age gathers the fruits of influence at the last</strong>.</p><p>For if the ills of which they complained were the faults of old age, the same ills would befall me and all other old men; but I have known many who were of such a nature that they bore their old age without complaint, who were not unhappy because they had been loosed from the chains of passion, and who were not scorned by their friends. <strong>But as regards all such complaints, the blame rests with character, not with age.</strong> For old men of self-control, who are neither churlish nor ungracious, find old age endurable; while <strong>on the other hand <a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure">perversity and an unkindly disposition render irksome every period of life</a></strong>…</p><p>Undoubtedly, Scipio and Laelius, <strong>the most suitable defenses of old age are the principles and practice of the virtues</strong>, which, if cultivated in every period of life, bring forth wonderful fruits at the close of a long and busy career, not only because they never fail you even at the very end of life—although that is a matter of highest moment—but also <strong>because it is most delightful to have the consciousness of a life well spent and the memory of many deeds worthily performed</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>3. … and the mind and body sufficiently prepared.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>But it is our duty, my young friends, to resist old age</strong>; to compensate for its defects by a watchful care; to fight against it as we would fight against disease; to adopt a regimen of health; to practice moderate exercise; and to take just enough of food and drink to restore our strength and not to overburden it. Nor, indeed, are we to give our attention solely to the body; <strong>much greater care is due to the mind and soul; for they, too, like lamps, grow dim with time, unless we keep them supplied with oil. </strong></p><p>For when Caecilius speaks of " the old fools of the comic stage," he has in mind old men characterized by credulity, forgetfulness, and carelessness, which are faults, not of old age generally, but only of an old age that is drowsy, slothful, and inert. </p></blockquote><h2>4. If prepared in this way, old age contributes more to the world that it’s youth.</h2><blockquote><p>Those, therefore, who allege that old age is devoid of useful activity adduce nothing to the purpose, and are like those who would say that the pilot does nothing in the sailing of the ship, because, while others are climbing the masts, or running about the gangways, or working at the pumps, he sits quietly in the stern and simply holds the tiller. </p><p>He may not be doing what younger members of the crew are doing, but what he does is better and much more important. <strong><a href="https://medium.com/butwhatfor/perseverance-is-great-but-dont-forget-to-prepare-ea8d5fe7e6fb">It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgement</a></strong>; in these qualities old age is usually not only not poorer but is even richer.</p></blockquote><h2>5. Old age should not fear the nearness of death as it is not unique to old age…</h2><blockquote><p><strong>And yet is there anyone so foolish, even though he is young, as to feel absolutely sure that he will be alive when evening comes</strong>? Nay, even youth, much more than old age, is subject to the accident of death; the young fall sick more easily, their sufferings are more intense, and they are cured with greater difficulty. </p><p>Therefore, <strong>few arrive at old age</strong>, and, but for this, life would be lived in better and wiser fashion. For it is in old men that reason and good judgement are found, and had it not been for old men no state would have existed at all.</p><p>But I return to the question of impending death. <strong>What fault is this which you charge against old age, when, as you see, it is one chargeable likewise to youth? </strong>That death is common to every age has been brought home to me by the loss of my dearest son.</p><p>They say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for. <strong>Yet he is in better case than the young man</strong>, since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained; <strong>the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>6. … and a life well lived lives well beyond its own years…</h2><blockquote><p>The actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end; it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays; and so <strong><a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain</a></strong>. For even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honorably and well; but if a longer period of years should be granted, one has no more cause to grieve than the farmers have that the pleasant springtime has passed and that summer and autumn have come. </p><p>Would it not have been far better for me to spend a leisured and quiet life, free from toil and strife? <strong>But somehow, my soul was ever on the alert, looking forward to posterity, as if it realized that when it had departed from this life, then at last would it be alive</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>7. … with nothing to regret when its course has been run.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>For what advantage has life—or, rather, what trouble does it not have?</strong> But even grant that it has great advantage, yet undoubtedly it has either satiety or an end. I do not mean to complain of life as many men, and they learned ones, have often done; <strong>nor do I regret that I have lived, since I have so lived that I think I was not born in vain</strong>, and I quit life as if it were an inn, not a home. For Nature has given us an hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide.</p><p><strong>For as Nature has marked the bounds of everything else, so she has marked the bounds of life</strong>. Moreover, old age is the final scene, as it were, in life’s drama, from which we ought to escape when it grows wearisome, and certainly, when we have had our fill. </p><p>Such, my friends, are my views on old age. <strong>May you both attain it, and thus be able to prove by experience the truth of what you have heard from me</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/">But What For?</a></strong> - Multidisciplinary insights for self development.

      <article>
      

<p>Let me ask you a question: How much value do you think your source code has?</p>

<p>To answer this question, let me take you a few years back, when I worked with a small high tech startup. We were working on a pretty complex augmented reality system spanning all layers from low-level computer vision components to cross-platform mobile and web apps. Especially for the lower-level components, a good amount of research had been involved. We worked closely with an academic institute that specialized in computer vision.</p>

<p>In short, this project wasn’t something that anybody could just easily recreate. So one of the assumptions we had implicitly made was that our source code was one of the company’s major assets.</p>

<p>When we hired a new COO, who had mainly worked at bigger companies before, he was shocked to hear that all our code, communication infrastructure and internal systems were living in the cloud. He argued that we should move to on-premise solutions as soon as possible, partially out of fear of intellectual property theft, partially to appease investors with similar fears.</p>

<p>While I had no say in it, his arguments seemed somewhat unreasonable to me at the time and I couldn’t put my finger on it. But the CTO was on board. So we installed a cheapo server in one of our office’s closets, even though someone had just broken into our building earlier that month. We got rid of GitLab, and moved away from Slack and Trello in favor of an on-prem Jira installation. The whole ordeal took months to complete, and I’m guessing that all things considered, it cost the small company of ~6 people about half a year of development time. There was also the ongoing opportunity cost of no longer being able to use any new tools that involved the cloud.</p>

<p>But the whole thing got me thinking about an interesting question: What would happen if someone just took all our code? Going even further, what would happen if we ourselves just put it all on GitHub, with a permissive license like MIT? Short of making investors think we’re crazy, what direct impact would that have had on the company?</p>

<p>I thought long and hard about these questions, and I think in our situation back then, the answer would have been: absolutely none.</p>

<h2 id="your-source-code-is-worthless">Your source code is worthless</h2>

<p>Let’s face it, we were still a fast-moving startup, even if the above anecdote might give you the opposite picture. Our code was still changing drastically every couple weeks. Changes of the entire architecture or complete re-writes of components were not uncommon, as is usual for some early stage startups. And as you might expect in such a situation, the code wasn’t of the highest quality either: Half the time, the build would be broken. Testing and documentation were basically non-existent. It was unlikely that anyone from outside the team would even have gotten the thing up and running. Even if they did, it would be outdated a moment later.</p>

<p>One of the fears from management was that a big company like Google could take our code and build a competing service. After thinking about this in more detail, the idea now seems laughable to me: They would be much faster just building it themselves from scratch, than trying to understand the crummy code we had hacked together.</p>

<p>But let’s take a step back and assume the opposite for a moment: Beautifully written, clean code with complete test coverage. One-click build process. Exceptionally well-written documentation of the architecture and components. Would this have changed the situation? I really don’t think it would have.</p>

<p>You see, in 2017, there actually was an incident of a high profile source code theft: Panic, a company that makes high quality Mac and iOS software, had the full source code for most of their apps <a href="https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code" target="_blank">stolen by hackers</a>. While the attackers demanded a ransom to prevent the public release of the code, Panic refused to pay. They came to the conclusion that the worst thing that could happen would be people building cracked versions of their Apps, full of malware. But that was already happening anyways (as with most software), even before the source code was stolen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure this was a pretty bad blow for Panic, and I’m in no way arguing that source code theft can’t be damaging. But even Panic says in their blog post that they were not too concerned with competitors using their code either, mainly because it would quickly become outdated:</p>

<p><em>“That source is already missing a ton of fixes and improvements we committed over the last week alone, and six months from now it will be missing major critical new features. In short: it’s old and getting older.”</em></p>

<p>So maybe code by itself is not that valuable, and yet, software companies still have value. If the tangible aspects of the technology, the code and documentation, are not the main assets of a company, what is?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-programming">What is programming</h3>

<p>I couldn’t really wrap my head around the previous question until I stumbled upon a wonderful article, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" target="_blank">Programming as Theory Building</a>, written by none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award" target="_blank">Turing Award</a> winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a>. If you’ve ever taken any formal computer science classes, you may have already heard his name: He’s the N in BNF, or Backus-Naur form, an important and widely-used notation for describing programming languages.</p>

<p>In the article, Naur describes his view of what programming really is. He argues that the main activity a programmer does is building a theory or model of the problem space in their head:</p>

<p><em>“[…] programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand.”</em></p>

<p>He calls this view of programming the <em>“Theory Building View”</em> and puts it in contrast to what he calls the <em>“Production View”</em>, in which <em>“[…] programming is regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.”</em></p>

<p>Naur argues that the production view, while it is widespread, contradicts many things we observe empirically in software projects. In contrast, the Theory Building View allows us to explain many phenomena, such as the observation I made in this article, that the source code itself holds little to no value.<sup id="fnref:naurwasfaster"><a href="#fn:naurwasfaster">1</a></sup> One of Naur’s main conclusions is that making changes to an existing program (to accommodate changing requirements) is often more costly than writing new code from scratch, at least if done by people from a different team. This is because there are intangible aspects of the model/theory in the programmer’s heads, which can’t be expressed in code and documentation:</p>

<p><em>“A main claim of the Theory Building View of programming is that an essential part of any program, the theory of it, is something that could not be conceivably expressed, but is inextricably bound to human beings.”</em></p>

<p>When a new team obtains the source code, they thus have to first re-build the original theory in their heads, which, Naur argues, can be more work than building their own theory from the ground up.</p>

<p>Naur brings multiple examples of real life product development where teams were asked to modify or extend a program, but couldn’t do it without help from the original development team, or otherwise they would be <em>“destroying its power and simplicity”</em>:</p>

<p><em>“[…] the program text and its documentation has proved insufficient as a carrier of some of the most important design ideas.”</em></p>

<p>Naur further says:</p>

<p><em>“The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.”</em></p>

<p>Since this knowledge is inherently intangible, it can’t be communicated through the code or documentation - it has to be experienced anew by each new programmer joining the team. While the previous programmers can help new team members in this task, the code itself and any written documentation is not very useful in this process. What are these intangible elements/aspects?</p>

<h3 id="intangible-aspects-of-software">Intangible aspects of software</h3>

<p>According to Naur, there are three aspects that are difficult or impossible to express in any written form of code or documentation, and yet the original programmer can easily explain them:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> The programmer knows and understands the relationship of the real world problem and the program. They can explain how the details of the problem are mapped into the code and into additional documentation:
<em>“Thus the programmer must be able to explain, for each part of the program text and for each of its overall structural characteristics, what aspect or activity of the world is matched by it.”</em></p>

<p>While I think it’s possible in theory to make this knowledge more tangible through documentation, doing so exhaustively would be wholly impractical. And yet, Naur notes, an exhaustive understanding of the real world problem is necessary to understand the theory of the program:</p>

<p><em>“By far the largest part of the world will of course lie outside the scope of the program text, being irrelevant in the context. However, the decision that a part of the world is relevant can only be made by someone who understands the whole world. This understanding must be contributed by the programmer.”</em></p>

<p>Let me give you an example from my own experience. A few years back, I was working on a project that improved the processes of a production line in a factory. The workers there were still using paper checklists for quality assurance, making the process labor-intense and error prone. We replaced those paper checklists with a mobile app that runs on a tablet. While the app itself was fairly simple, the underlying business processes were complex - multiple different assembly lines and a variety of different machines were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>At <a href="https://www.escrypt.com/en" rel="noopener">ESCRYPT</a>, we basically design, enable and manage IT security. As security consultants, we are specialized in security strategy, trainings and a variety of other fields within the automotive software domain. We consider ourselves experts in all kinds of testing methods, including functional testing, vulnerability scans, penetration testing, everything from automated testing to manual testing, and of course fuzzing.</p>
<p>In our testing efforts, we like to take a holistic approach, which means that we test electronic control units individually, but also the entire vehicle platform. Our goal is basically to secure the whole ecosystem of a connected car.</p>

<p><em>“In a connected world, cybersecurity is as important for your safety as the brakes” </em><em>– </em>Ralf Speth, CEO Jaguar/Land Rover</p>

<p>When I started with automotive security, we were securing all electronic control units (ECUs) individually. Since then, the complexity and connectivity of vehicles have increased dramatically, creating more opportunities for potential attackers to infiltrate those systems. This change requires a completely different approach and a new set of security skills. To sum up the key developments I have witnessed during my career, I have summarized 5 uncomfortable truths about automotive cybersecurity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. The Titanic Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, there will be 775.000.000 connected cars worldwide. The titanic syndrome states that those who put themselves in danger, will perish. In the development of increasingly software-driven connected vehicles, this means that those car manufacturers (OEMs) who don’t have a security strategy will not survive, as security can be seen as an indispensable foundation of interconnectivity.</p>
<p>However, the main challenge is that security vulnerabilities only become visible to the public when it's already too late. Customers usually don't notice when security is cut for profits (until their car fails them). And this is why there are still so many managers who see security primarily as a cost driver.<span></span></p>
<h3><span>What can you do?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Treat security as a strategic task</li>
<li>Create security awareness throughout the entire company</li>
<li>Enable security orchestration of the whole software development lifecycle</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>2. No Safety without Security</strong></h2>
<p>Cyberattacks on vehicles have increased by a factor of seven over the last four years. Even if only a small number of those attacks are successful, the consequences can be devastating, especially as they are a potential threat to an entire fleet of vehicles.<span></span></p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use original equipment from trusted partners</li>
<li>Consider security during the entire lifecycle</li>
<li>Enable your team (IDS, SOC, Firewall)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>3. 100% Security is not affordable</strong></h2>
<p>There are 100 million lines of code (LoC) in the new Golf 8. For comparison, in a Boeing 787 there are only 14 Million LoC! Even if your team has an excellent bug detection rate, you will still, almost certainly, miss some bugs or vulnerabilities. The challenge here is balancing the risk and the investment, meaning that you will have to decide how much risk you are willing to take.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segment your car and define safety critical parts</li>
<li>Prioritize your security activities in the important fields<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Build resilient systems</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>4. Omnipresent Threat</strong></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/SecuritySituation/SecuritySituation_node.html" rel="noopener">German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)</a>, each day there are 322,000 new malware threats. <span><span>If you don't find those vulnerabilities first, someone else will exploit them. </span></span>The complexity of our systems is increasing dramatically. Since vehicles have quite a long lifecycle, the software complexity will increase even further while the car is on the road. This means that you will need to put in some extra effort to keep your car secure in the long run.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the right strategy from the beginning</li>
<li>Protect all connected entities</li>
<li>Ensure long-term security&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>5. Impending Sanctions</strong></h2>
<p>It's important to comply with new regulations such as the new<a href="https://www.escrypt.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/ECE-TRANS-WP29-2020-079-Revised-2.pdf" rel="noopener"> UNECE regulations</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/iso-21434-compliance"><span>ISO 21434. </span></a>Even if these norms aren't mandatory yet, OEMs who do not follow the rules will soon be disqualified. As if automotive software wasn’t complicated enough, these norms and regulations increase the complexity even further, which is why many developers perceive them as additional requirements.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong, regulations are very important to facilitate the use of effective security measures, but in some cases, they can lead to over-regulation. This means that complying with norms and standards becomes more important than the actual task at hand. Regulations certainly create pressure within the industry, but they can also be an opportunity, for example to convince the upper management to reassess their priorities. Security must come first!</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire legal experts</li>
<li>Implement standard-compliant security design</li>
<li>Implement a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Security is not a product, but a process” - </em>Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer &amp; Security Expert</p>

<p>I'm glad to see that testing methods such as <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing" rel="noopener">feedback-based fuzzing</a> are emerging as a new standard in the automotive sector. Nevertheless, we need to think about automotive security in a much broader way. The security perspective has to be kept in mind during the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). This includes the management of processes, security strategy and company culture.</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Data labelling is often the biggest bottleneck in machine learning — finding, managing and labelling vast quantities of data to build a sufficiently performing model can take weeks or months. Active learning lets you train machine learning models with <strong>much</strong> less labelled data. The best AI-driven companies, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=475s">Tesla, already use active learning</a>. We think you should too.</p><h2 id="the-conventional-approach-vs-active-learning-creating-a-spam-filter">The conventional approach vs active learning - creating a spam filter</h2><p>Imagine that you wanted to build a spam filter for your emails. The conventional approach (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">at least since 2002</a>) is to collect a large number of emails, label them as "spam" or "not spam" and then train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between the two classes. The conventional approach assumes all the data is equally valuable, but in most datasets there are class imbalances, noisy data and lots of redundancy.</p><blockquote><strong>The conventional approach wastes time labelling data that doesn't improve your model's performance. And you don't even know if your model is useful until you've finished labelling all the data.</strong></blockquote><p>Humans don't require thousands of randomly labelled examples to learn the difference between spam and legitimate email. If you were teaching a human to solve this task you'd expect to be able to give them a few examples of what you want, have them learn quickly and ask questions when they were unsure.</p><p>Active learning operates using the same intuition, using the model you're training to find and label only the most valuable data.</p><p>In active learning, you first provide a small number of labelled examples. The model is trained on this "seed" dataset. Then, the model "asks questions" by selecting the unlabeled data points it is unsure about, so the human can "answer" the questions by providing labels for those points. The model updates again and the process is repeated until the performance is good enough. <strong>By having the human iteratively teach the model, it's possible to make a better model, in less time, with much less labelled data.</strong></p><p>So how can the model find the next data point that needs labelling? Some commonly used methods are:</p><ol><li>select the data points where the model's predictive distribution has highest entropy</li><li>pick data points where the model's favored prediction is least confident</li><li>train an ensemble of models and focus on the data points where they disagree</li></ol><p>At Humanloop we actually use custom methods that leverage Bayesian deep learning to get better uncertainty estimates.</p><h2 id="three-benefits-of-using-active-learning">Three Benefits of Using Active Learning</h2><h3 id="1-you-spend-less-time-and-money-on-labelling-data">1. You spend less time and money on labelling data</h3><p>Active learning has been shown to deliver large savings in data labelling across a wide range of tasks and data sets ranging from computer vision to NLP. Since data labelling is one of the most expensive parts of training modern machine learning models this should be enough justification on its own!</p><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/learning_curves.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png 700w"><figcaption>Using active learning gets to higher model accuracies with less labelled data</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-you-get-faster-feedback-on-model-performance">2. You get faster feedback on model performance</h3><p>Usually people label their data <em>before</em> they train any models or get any feedback. Often, it takes days or weeks of iterating on annotation guidelines and re-labelling only to discover that model performance falls far short of what is needed, or different labelled data is required. Since Active Learning trains a model frequently <em>during</em> the data labelling process, it's possible to get feedback and correct issues that might otherwise be discovered much later.</p><h3 id="3-your-model-will-have-higher-final-accuracy">3. Your model will have higher final accuracy</h3><p>People are often surprised that models trained with active learning not only learn faster but can actually converge to a better final model (with less data). We're told so often that more data is better, that it's easy to forget that the quality of the data matters just as much as the quantity. If the dataset contains ambiguous examples which are hard to label accurately this can actually degrade your final model performance.</p><p>The order the model sees examples also matters. There's an entire sub-field of machine learning, called curriculum learning, which studies how you can improve model performance by first teaching about simple concepts before teaching complex ones. &nbsp;Think "Arithmetic before advanced calculus". Active learning naturally enforces a curriculum on your models and helps them achieve better overall performance.</p><h2 id="if-active-learning-is-so-great-then-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-it">If active learning is so great, then why doesn't everyone use it?</h2><p>Most of our tools and processes for building machine learning models weren't designed with Active Learning in mind. There are often different teams of people responsible for data labelling vs model training but active learning requires these processes to be coupled. If you do get these teams to work together, you still need a lot of infrastructure to connect model training to annotation interfaces. Most of the software libraries being used assume all of your data is labelled before you train a model, so to use active learning you have to write a tonne of boiler plate. You also need to figure out how best to host your model, have the model communicate with a team of annotators and update itself as it gets data asynchronously from different annotators.</p><p>On top of this, modern deep learning models are very slow to update, so frequently retraining them from scratch is painful. Nobody wants to label a hundred examples then wait 24 hours for a model to be fully re-trained before labelling the next 100. Deep learning models also tend to have millions or billions of parameters and getting good uncertainty estimates from these models is an open research problem.</p><p>If you read academic papers on active learning, you might think active learning will give you a small saving in labels but for a huge amount of work. The papers are misleading though because they operate on academic datasets that tend to be balanced/clean. They almost always label one example at a time and they forget that not every data-point is equally easy to label. On more realistic problems with large class imbalances, noisy data and variable labelling costs, the benefits can be much bigger than the literature suggests. In some cases there can be a 10x reduction in labelling costs.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-active-learning-today">How to use Active Learning today</h2><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/logos-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/logos-1.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/logos-1.png 1000w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/logos-1.png 1600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/logos-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many of the biggest hurdles to using active learning are just a question of having the right infrastructure. Just as tools like Keras and PyTorch dramatically reduced the pain of deriving gradients, new tools are emerging to make active learning much easier.</p><p>There are open source python libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL">modAL</a> that take away much of the boilerplate. ModAL is built on top of scikit-learn and lets you combine different models with any active learning strategy you like. It takes much of the work out of implementing different uncertainty measures, is open source and modular. The pros of ModAL are the range of methods it provides out of the box and the fact that it's open source. The downside of libraries like modAL is they don't include any annotation interfaces and still leave the work of hosting a model and connecting it to annotation interfaces up to you.</p><p>That brings us to annotation interfaces:</p><p>Probably the most popular tool for individual data scientists is Prodigy. Prodigy is an annotation interface built by the makers of Spacy and so can naturally be combined with their fantastic NLP library to use basic active learning. It's not open-source but you can download it as a pip wheel and install it locally. Whilst Prodigy is a good tool for individuals, it hasn't been designed to support teams of annotators and only implements the most basic forms of Active Learning. To make this work with teams, still requires you to host prodigy yourself and can be a lot of work to set up.</p><p>Labelbox provides interfaces for a variety of image annotations and has recently added support for text as well. Unlike Prodigy, Labelbox has been designed with teams of annotators in mind and has more tools for ensuring that your labels are correct. They don't have any native support for active learning or model training but do allow you to upload predictions from your model to the annotation interface via API. This means that if you have implemented an active learning acquisition function and are training a model, you can set up an active learning loop. Though the most of the work is left to you.</p><h2 id="humanloop">Humanloop</h2><p>We built Humanloop to solve many of the problems of existing tools. Our goal is to make deploying and maintaining natural language models faster and easier than ever before.</p><p>Humanloop provides an annotation interface for NLP tasks that lets you train a model as you annotate and uses active learning out of the box. We support teams of annotators and have incorporated state of the art techniques for active learning and quality assurance. This makes it possible to get real time feedback during training, even when using modern deep models. We also make it easy to deploy to an optimised model run-time immediately after training and to even update your data post deployment.</p><h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2><p>Active Learning:</p><ul><li>reduces how much data you need to label, dramatically reducing one of your biggest costs.</li><li>gives you faster feedback on your model's performance.</li><li>producer higher performing models.</li></ul><p>At Humanloop we think that active learning should be a standard tool for data scientists. We also believe that good tools should make this easy.</p><p>There's more to Humanloop than active learning though. We're building infrastructure for AI models and human teams to work alongside each other so that anyone can quickly augment their team with AI assistance.</p><p>If you're interested in finding out more, send us a message or <a href="https://humanloop.com/demo">book a demo!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>What we learned about 3D avatars in 7 years of making them</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Christoph Niemann is an illustrator whose work was featured on over thirty covers of the New Yorker magazine. In the first episode of Netflix's docuseries "Abstract,â€� Niemann introduced a concept called </span><i><span>abstract-o-meter</span></i><span>. It suggests that </span><b>every idea has a </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> way to represent it</b><span>. It canâ€™t be too abstract nor too realistic. For example, no one would know that you meant to talk about love if you used a red pixel to represent it. The same thing applies to a realistic drawing of heart, which looks more disgusting rather than lovely. Hence when we talk about love, we use the heart-shaped symbol that everyone is familiar with.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><b>The same concept applies to 3D avatars that we use to represent our identities in virtual worlds and to show our emotions to others</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446205-abstract-o-meter-3d-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="A scale showing realistic heart, a heart shape, and a red pixel drawings" title="Christoph Niemann's &quot;Abstract-o-meter&quot;"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Abstract-o-meter, Christoph Niemann</span></i></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Abstract 3D avatars are too simple</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>It's hard to show our expressions in games with a simple and abstract visual style. In Minecraft, the avatar's face measures 8x8 pixels. Itâ€™s barely enough room to fit eyes and a mouth â€“ not enough to represent a wide range of emotions. In fact, Minecraft doesn't offer any expressions besides blinking with compatible character skins.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612447071-minecraft-star-wars-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack" title="Minecraft avatars from Star Wars"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack (Mojang Studios)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Showing your identity in a world made of big pixels isn't a simple task either. You can give someone a general idea of how you look and what colors you like to wear. But it would be hard to distinguish, for example, a black denim jacket from an elegant blazer.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Hyper-realistic 3D avatars are too realistic</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>On the other side of the spectrum, we have hyper-realistic avatars. In Rogue One, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/movies/how-rogue-one-brought-back-grand-moff-tarkin.html"><span>Disney created a digital version of Wilhuff Tarkin</span></a><span> based on the actor who played him a few decades before â€“ Peter Cushing. This was possible thanks to advanced motion tracking technology and an actor (Guy Henry) who learned how to behave and talk like Cushing.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The same technique is used in modern AAA games, like Cyberpunk 2077. The challenging part is to make the representation perfect. Otherwise, we experience an effect called the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley"><b>uncanny valley</b></a><span>. If the humanoid character or object doesn't perfectly resemble a human, we tend to have negative emotions. In other words â€“ we are creeped out.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446327-star-wars-rogue-one-tarkin-3d-realistic-avatar-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie" title="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Lucasfilm)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>In the movie and gaming industries, studios have access to and can afford advanced tracking solutions. But they also spend thousands of hours on post-processing to make the characters look like real humans. </span><b>For consumers, thereâ€™s no way to use a hyper-realistic avatar based on the userâ€™s appearance. </b><span>Modern games often have advanced character creators, but customization options are limited just to pre-set values and assets.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>These avatars are also not able to represent the playerâ€™s expressions. And there is no affordable face tracking devices available on the mass market that could produce results comparable to the recent Star Wars movies. Not to mention the challenge of rendering super-detailed 3D characters, especially in games like Call of Duty: Warzone with a hundred players on one server.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>The </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> solution for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>The </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> solution for avatars is a simple one. Going back to the uncanny valley concept â€“ it's called a </span><i><span>valley</span></i><span> because we dislike only humanoids that look </span><i><span>almost</span></i><span> like humans. </span><b>But we tend to like </b><b><i>slightly</i></b><b> abstract representations of humans, like cartoon and game characters</b><span>. These avatars are more detailed than the Minecraft ones, making it easier to show one's identity and emotions. On the other hand, they are not too detailed, making it simpler to show basic emotions without creeping someone out. They are also less challenging to render for average hardware, even in large scale games like Fortnite.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446407-fortnite-avatar-battle-royale-game-readyplayer-me-wolf3d.jpeg" alt="3D characters in game Fornite" title="Fortnite from Epic Games"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Fortnite (Epic Games)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The current state of consumer technology allows us to use these simpler avatars to have social interactions in the virtual worlds. For example, there are software-based solutions for emulating mouth movement, like </span><a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-lipsync-unity/"><span>Oculus Lipsync</span></a><span>. We can also get a good representation of body movement with the controllers that come with virtual reality headsets available today. This is essential for getting non-verbal communication in virtual worlds right.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Finding the right balance for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>But there's one more reason why less realistic avatars are </span><i><span>just right</span></i><span>, and we learned it through our companyâ€™s long history of making avatars. When we started Wolf3D seven years ago, we built full-body scanners for creating hyper-realistic human models desired by movie and gaming studios. When Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014, we realized that 3D avatars will play an important role in the future. </span><b>We shifted our focus and decided to make it easy for anyone to create their own 3D avatar</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Our first step in that direction was easy-to-use, egg-shaped face scanners. We shipped them to many places worldwide, including museums in Estonia and Finland, E3 game shows in Las Vegas, and Paramount Studios in Hollywood.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The next step was to make scanning even more accessible. </span><b>We decided to use the data from tens of thousands of high-resolution scans to build a software-based solution</b><span>. With just fifteen photos and a phone app, anyone could create a realistic 3D model of their face.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446455-egg-face-3d-scanner-readyplayerme-avatars-wolf3d.png" alt="Wolf3D's high-quality 3D face scanner " title="The egg-shaped face scanner from Wolf3D"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Wolf3Dâ€™s egg-shaped scanner</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>At this stage, </span><b>we learned that people didn't want an avatar that looks </b><b><i>exactly</i></b><b> like them â€“ they wanted something more</b><span>. It's like with Instagram profiles â€” no one posts photos of their dirty dishes (please, prove me wrong). Instead, we choose to create an idealistic version of our lives featuring pictures from trips to Bali, plates full of sushi, and selfies from Coachella.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Where are we now and what's the future of 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Learning this, </span><b>we set Wolf3D on its current tracks and made a simpler avatar creator based on a single selfie</b><span>. It allows anyone with a camera and access to the Internet to create an idealized, 3D version of themselves. All with the </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> balance â€“ not too abstract, not too realistic. Cristian Anton, Co-founder and CEO of MeetinVR, said in an </span><a href="https://readyplayer.me/blog/talking-about-realistic-3d-avatars-and-future-of-work-with-meetinvrs-ceo"><span>interview with Wolf3D's CEO</span></a><span> that "</span><i><span>what we have here [...] is like the perfect balance, at least for what is possible with the current technology.</span></i><span>"</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img alt="3D human avatars standing in different poses on a green background" title="Just the right balance between realistic and abstract avatars" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612445670-realistic-3d-avatars-ready-player-me-wolf3d.jpg"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Wolf3Dâ€™s Ready Player Me avatars</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><a href="https://readyplayer.me/"><b>Ready Player Me</b></a><b> avatars are our current </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> solution for avatars</b><span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				




<h2>Background</h2>



<p>Interestingly enough, it took me four months to start writing an article about starting things. I’m not kidding:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="556" height="522" src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" data-src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w"></figure></div>



<p>I did publish the <a href="https://unstructed.tech/2020/12/11/we-all-come-with-a-bucket-of-sht/">bucket of sh*t one</a> after two months, but this one took a while. Which I think is a perfect starting ground for analyzing what I wanted to write about anyway – why do we keep delaying and procrastinating with stuff. </p>



<p>This article is broken into two parts. In the first part, we will be dealing with all the reasons why we delay, procrastinate and generally avoid starting things. In the second part, we will discuss specific steps that you can (and should) take in order to actually start doing them. Lastly, I will provide a list of resources that you might find useful.</p>



<p>So, let’s start with – WHY.</p>



<h2>Part I – Why?</h2>



<p>Starting this section without referring to one of THE BEST articles I ever read on this subject would be absolutely unfair. It was almost eight years ago that a friend of mine sent me the article that “I just have to read. Immediately!”. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a> is, to this day, one of THE MOST influential articles I ever read on the subject. Once you finish this one, I would urge you to go and read that one as well. It is listed in the “Useful Resources” section so you won’t miss it.</p>



<p>Anyway, why do we delay doing things that we want to do? And this can literally be anything – starting those yoga classes, changing a job, writing a graduation thesis, committing to a new diet or, in this specific case – starting an article about starting new things.</p>



<p>Obviously, I can’t speak for everyone out there, but I surely can tell you what my problem is. And, in all honesty, what seems to be a common denominator for all of those that I’ve spoken to. It always boils down to – fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the uncertainty. Fear of failing. Fear of being laughed at. Fear of being afraid. Yikes!</p>



<p>Let’s talk fear.</p>



<h3>Fear</h3>



<p>Strictly speaking, what I refer to as “fear” is what my therapist calls “anxiety”. Here’s how he describes it (and I’m paraphrasing, obviously):</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is when you are afraid that there is a lion in the room, even though there isn’t one. Fear is when there actually IS a lion in the room.</p><cite>Source: my therapist</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fear is a really useful emotion. Just stop and think about it. It’s what helped our species survive and evolve enough to argue politics and record TikTok videos. Seriously. Let me quote Wikipedia as well:</p>



<blockquote><p>Fear is an emotion induced by perceived danger or threat, which causes physiological changes and ultimately behavioral changes, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Again, think about it. Or, better yet, <span>think of our ancestors. Hundreds of thousand of years ago, if they weren’t able to perceive a danger of being eaten by a lion, I wouldn’t be here writing this and you surely wouldn’t be the one reading it</span>. It’s valid even today – standing on the edge of the cliff, if there weren’t for a fear, you’d have no problem jumping off. Or being hit by a car. My point is – <span>fear is an extremely useful emotion and definitely the one favored by evolution</span>. It helps you survive.</p>



<p>Let me share one anecdote – there was a period in my life when, for whatever the reasons were, I got obsessed with the psychopathy. And I’ve been reading A LOT about it. Yep. It sounds crazy, I know, but there was some reasoning behind it. If you’ve never read anything of the kind, you’re probably thinking of “psychopaths” as a crazy axe swinging murderers who butcher people for fun. Well, sorry to disappoint you but that’s just Hollywood (mostly). Psychopathy, in a very layman’s terms, refers to a different structure of a brain which, among other things, causes a complete lack of empathy. As in – they have no sense of regret. Now, without going into too many details of it, one of the things that psychopaths experience is – lack of fear. They don’t have any sense of fear (or it’s a very very weak one). And you know what the problem is? They have HARD time surviving! Which explains why’s there not that many of them. In order to live long enough to be portrayed in movies, they actually have to LEARN what things are dangerous and what can (and will) kill them. Yep. So, without spending too much time on the topic, I just want to say – be grateful for that sense of fear that you have.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me go back to the original story. Fear and anxiety. So, fear is a useful emotion that helps you survive. But anxiety? Not so much.</p>



<p>Let’s talk anxiety now.</p>



<h3>Anxiety</h3>



<p>Here’s what Wikipedia says on the subject:</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It includes subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Looks similar to fear, right? And yet, it’s not. <span>Fear is helpful. Anxiety is rather opposite</span>. Fear is what helps you live to see another day and watch Netflix. Anxiety is what prohibits you from living long, happy and healthy enough to watch all those Netflix shows. <span>Favor the fear, but be careful of anxiety</span>.</p>



<p>From my point of view, and please do take this with outmost grain of salt, but – <span><strong>I believe that <em>one of</em> the main issues is that we confuse anxiety for fear</strong></span>. More specifically, we perceive anxiousness as a fear and, a natural behavioural response is – to get the hell out of that situation. Even if it’s only in our heads, the response is nevertheless the same.</p>



<p>Now, a logical question that follows is – how do you get rid of anxiety? Well, let me burst that bubble immediately – you don’t. I’m not a specialist of any kind but, <span>from my investigation and experience, there’s not a single emotion that you can “get rid off”. What you can (and should) do is – learn the tools of the trade</span>. Learn how to deal with them and, eventually, live with them. Easier said than done, but absolutely doable.</p>



<h3>Tools of the trade</h3>



<p>Let me tell you two more anecdotes. I have no idea why, but I seem to be all about anecdotes today.</p>



<p>I was listening (well, technically I’m re-listening to it almost every day during a workout) to Pavel Tsatsouline talking about muscle hypertrophy. For those who are not familiar with the guy – he’s an amazingly respected fitness instructor who, among other things, “brought” kettlebells to USA. And muscle hypertrophy is, well, the process of growing your muscles really. So, what he was saying is – “when it comes to muscle hypertrophy, we pretty much have no idea what’s really happening. But we do know which buttons to push and we do have the tools of the trade that help us get there”. Hence, <span>we have no clue WHY or HOW the muscles really grow, but we do know how to get them to do so</span>.</p>



<p>Another one is from the book written by Robert C. Martin, famously known (to developers) as Uncle Bob. It’s about agile development. And one thing that I highlighted and that I’m quoting in its original form is – “Some folks think that Agile is about going fast. It’s not. It’s never been about going fast. Agile is about knowing, as early as possible, just how screwed we are.”. </p>



<p>Now, one might wonder, and rightfully so – what the hell am I talking about? And <span>what exactly is a connection between muscle hypertrophy, agile development and dealing with anxiet</span>y, right? Well, let me help you make that connection. Both are amazingly complex processes, for which we mostly have no idea what exactly is happening, but we do have enough data and knowledge to tackle them properly. <span><strong>And that’s exactly how you should tackle any anxiety – by using the battle tested tools of the trade that we have</strong></span>. That’s what the Part II is all about anyway.</p>



<p>I’ll close this section with a quote from Jordan Peterson who happens to be, among other things, a rather famous clinical psychologist. I’m paraphrasing his words: “Do you know how we approach and help people who are extremely anxious? We first explain to them that they will never be ‘free’ of anxiety. They will always remain anxious. But <span>through careful chunking and constant work, we help them get used to that feeling, until it loses its intensity. It’s still there, but it’s not blocking you any more. And that’s how you beat anxiety</span>“.</p>



<h2>Part II – How?</h2>



<p>If you read the Part I, which I hope you did, you probably concluded what I believe is the biggest obstacle to embarking on anything new. If not, well, here’s a quick summary – it’s all about fear. Yep. Whatever the reasoning you come up with, if you dig deep enough, you will end up with some sort of fear. Or, shall I say, anxiety? 🙂</p>



<p>Now, does that make it any easier to deal with? Hell no! Quite the contrary. <span>Starting anything new is HARD</span>. Especially if it’s something that you never did before. Not to mention if you tried and “failed”. Ouch!</p>



<p>So, let me repeat that. <span>Starting anything new is DAMN HARD</span>. Just like growing muscles or starting a new project is. But here’s the most important thing – <span>once we accept that it’s hard and that it’s ok for it to be hard, and trust me, <strong>sometimes acceptance is the hardest part</strong>, we are ready for the next step</span>. And the next step is – using the tools of the trade that were battle tested by many before us.</p>



<h3>Very first step – write it down and let it sink in</h3>



<p>Yep, when it comes to myself, and, I’m sure, for many others, one of the issues is that we want everything at once. Immediately. No time to waste. Or, as we sometimes put it – “I don’t want to half ass something. …</p></div></div>

Exactly why this is happening is unknown.</p>  <p>"We were kind of shocked," said Casiraghi, a postdoctoral researcher in biology at the University of Washington.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He is the lead author of a study published this week <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabe0465">in the journal <em>Science Advances</em></a>, which tracked&nbsp;three Indigenous communities in Argentina, and compared them to&nbsp;students at the University of Washington. The work was led by University of Washington biology professor Horacio de la Iglesia and involved a&nbsp;team of researchers from Yale University and National University of Quilmes in Argentina.</p>  <p>The team fitted participants with wrist monitors akin to sophisticated smart watches, which collected biological sleep data for between one and two lunar cycles&nbsp;(one lunar cycle lasts about 29.5 days.)</p>  <p>A majority of the participants in the study were found to go to bed later and sleep less in the week ahead of a full moon.</p>  <p>"It might be that the biological clock is being delayed in a way that now it's telling you to go to sleep at a later time, but it might also be that for some reason this accumulation of waking time is not as important during certain days of the moon cycles," said&nbsp;Casiraghi.</p>  <h2>Sleep in the real world</h2>  <p>Casiraghi's research supervisor de la Iglesia<strong>&nbsp;</strong>had previously studied how lunar phases are correlated with increased activity in animals, such as crabs and monkeys in Argentina.</p>    <p>That was a springboard to asking: What about humans?</p>  <p>While previous sleep clinic research had&nbsp;investigated connections between lunar cycles and sleep, Casiraghi said&nbsp;those studies were limited by the fact that participants were in an unrealistic, lab-like setting, and results couldn't be easily replicated.</p>  <p>Casiraghi noted past research has established that with greater access to electric light, people tend to go to sleep later into the evening and have shorter nights than those with limited access.</p>  <p>He set out to study this in the real world, tracking the sleep patterns&nbsp;of about 100 participants spread across three Indigenous Toba/Qom communities in Formosa, Argentina.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Leandro Casiraghi, right, and Adán García, one of the Toba field assistants involved in the study.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Germán Joosten)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>One community was urban and had ready access to artificial light; another was rural but had limited access to artificial light; and the third, also rural, had no access to artificial light.</p>  <p>Casiraghi said going into the study, the team assumed if they found any sleep effect linked to lunar phases, the signal would be strongest on the night of a full or new moon, when the moon glow was at its brightest in the middle of the night. The argument would be that the light helped our&nbsp;ancestors see more clearly and stay active later.</p>  <h2>Assumptions eclipsed</h2>  <p>That's also why the team assumed they might find an effect in the groups with no or little access to electric light, because those groups might stand to benefit more from moonlit nights than those with ample access to light in the home.</p>  <p>But two unexpected patterns emerged.</p>  <p>The team found most people across the three groups went to bed later and slept less than usual — not on a full or new moon&nbsp;—&nbsp;but in the three to five days before. The amount of sleep on average varied between 46 and 58 minutes over the course of the lunar cycle. Bedtimes varied by around half an hour.</p>  <p>And sleep cycles of the urban and two rural communities displayed similar rhythm changes in the few days before the full moon, regardless of access to light.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q17i1srjOqY" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>The urbanites with access to light around the clock went to bed later and slept less on average than either rural community during those days. The rural community with some access to light went to sleep earlier than the urbanites, but later than the light-free rural community, which also slept more than all three.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the main effect was the same. Access to electric light didn't shield groups from the stimulating effects of the moon.</p>  <p>"We went through the data like 10 times to convince us what we were seeing was actually true," said Casiraghi.</p>      <p>The team compared their findings to sleep data gleaned from nearly 500 University of Washington undergraduates&nbsp;in past studies.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The same "striking" correlation between moon phases and sleep patterns was apparent in the undergrads living in post-industrial Seattle as in the Toba/Qom.</p>  <h2>Light not the only driver</h2>  <p>Casiraghi has a theory as to why it would've benefited early humans to stay up later during this time.</p>  <p>In the days before a full moon, the sun sets and a luminous moon takes its place in the sky earlier in the evening than usual.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Casiraghi suggested it could've been adaptive for hunter-gatherer groups to take advantage of the fact that the moonlight "stretched the day," allowing longer periods of activity.&nbsp;Full moons in the middle of the night provided less useful benefit.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This squares with the cultural stories of the Toba/Qom. They said brighter nights around the full moon were traditionally used to safely hunt and fish later into the evening. It was also a time for greater social activity, they say — including romantic trysts between young people.</p>  <p>But Casiraghi admitted this doesn't fully explain what's going on.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/last-full-moon.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/last-full-moon.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/last-full-moon.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/last-full-moon.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>A full moon rises over Calgary as if wedged between city skyscrapers.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Francois Bernier)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If people living in a big city setting surrounded by television screens, household light sources and light pollution are staying up later ahead of a full moon, the light itself can't be the only driver.</p>  <p>The answer may be hiding in our biology.&nbsp;</p>    <p>On any given night, we tuck in for two reasons: our biological clock tells us to, and we've been awake so long we've reached an energetic limit for the day.</p>  <p>Which of those two is being influenced by the moon —&nbsp;and how the moon is exerting that influence —&nbsp;remains a mystery, said Casiraghi.</p>  <p>"These are the questions we're trying to engage with in the near future."&nbsp;</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/brycehoye">Bryce Hoye.</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/img/sos.png" width="200"></p>
<p>In early 2019, we started visiting campuses across India to recruit the best and brightest minds to ensure LinkedIn, and all the services that make up its complex technology stack, is always available for everyone. This critical function at Linkedin falls under the purview of the Site Engineering team and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones</p>
<p>As we continued on this journey we started getting a lot of questions from these campuses on what exactly the site reliability engineering role entails? And, how could someone learn the skills and the disciplines involved to become a successful site reliability engineer? Fast forward a few months, and a few of these campus students had joined LinkedIn either as interns or as full-time engineers to become a part of the Site Engineering team; we also had a few lateral hires who joined our organization who were not from a traditional SRE background. That's when a few of us got together and started to think about how we can onboard new graduate engineers to the Site Engineering team.</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on what the roles and responsibilities of SREs are, how to monitor site health, production incidents, define SLO/SLI etc. But there are very few resources out there guiding someone on the basic skill sets one has to acquire as a beginner. Because of the lack of these resources, we felt that individuals have a tough time getting into open positions in the industry. We created the School Of SRE as a starting point for anyone wanting to build their career as an SRE.</p>
<p>In this course, we are focusing on building strong foundational skills. The course is structured in a way to provide more real life examples and how learning each of these topics can play an important role in day to day SRE life. Currently we are covering the following topics under the School Of SRE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals Series<ul>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/linux_basics/intro/">Linux Basics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/git/git-basics/">Git</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/linux_networking/intro/">Linux Networking</a></li>

<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/python_web/intro/">Python and Web</a></li>

<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/security/intro/">Security</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe continuous learning will help in acquiring deeper knowledge and competencies in order to expand your skill sets, every module has added references which could be a guide for further learning. Our hope is that by going through these modules we should be able to build the essential skills required for a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>
<p>At Linkedin, we are using this curriculum for onboarding our non-traditional hires and new college grads into the SRE role. We had multiple rounds of successful onboarding experience with new employees and the course helped them be productive in a very short period of time. This motivated us to open source the content for helping other organizations in onboarding new engineers into the role and provide guidance for aspiring individuals to get into the role. We realize that the initial content we created is just a starting point and we hope that the community can help in the journey of refining and expanding the content.

It doesn’t seem like there’s a good collection of these anywhere on the internet, especially in regard to past software design guides. I think there’s a lot of value in these even outside of just being a historic reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>How well is <code>__int128</code> supported, and what are its
properties? A Godbolt-based survey of the Big Four compilers.
Spoiler alert: libc++ thinks it’s integral, libstdc++ thinks it’s integral
only in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode(!), and MSVC thinks it doesn’t exist at all.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Rein Halbersma for alerting me to libstdc++’s different behavior
in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode versus <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-support">Compiler support</h2>



<p>GCC, Clang, and Intel ICC all support a built-in <code>__int128</code> type.
Microsoft MSVC does not support any 128-bit integral type as far as I’m aware.</p>

<p>On GCC, Clang, and ICC, <code>__int128</code> is a token similar to <code>int</code>: you can modify
it with <code>unsigned</code> to produce <code>unsigned __int128</code>. However, all three front-ends
also support the built-in synonyms <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__int128_t, __int128&gt;);
static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__uint128_t, unsigned __int128&gt;);
    // PASSES on all three compilers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code> are safe to use in non-type template parameters
and constant expressions, on all compilers that support them.</p>

<h2 id="sneaky-macros">Sneaky macros</h2>

<p>The story on libstdc++ is complicated. Libstdc++ doesn’t do anything special for
<code>__int128</code>, but it does provide <em>macro hooks</em>
(<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/87798f3f2cf97b30e75110b5a8d2964aef62be02/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/type_traits#L285-L293">link</a>)
so that for example
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> will be treated as an integral type, whatever that macro
expands to. (If it doesn’t expand to anything, it’ll be ignored.)</p>

<p>If you compile with GCC in <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>),
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> won’t be defined and so libstdc++ will consider
<code>__int128</code> a non-integral type.</p>

<p>But if you compile with GCC in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>), then the compiler
will pre-define these two macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define __GLIBCXX_BITSIZE_INT_N_0 128
#define __GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0 __int128
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23156">As of July 2016-ish</a>, Clang also
defines these two macros in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode.</p>

<p>By the way, you can use the options <code>-dM -E</code> to view all your compiler’s pre-defined macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>clang++ -std=c++17 -dM -E test.cc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The upshot is, if you compile in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will treat <code>__int128</code> and
<code>unsigned __int128</code> as integral types with the proper numeric limits; but if you
compile in the usual <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will not do any of that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libc++ treats <code>__int128</code> as an integer type, full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve worked on several projects that compiled with <code>-std=c++17 -D_GNU_SOURCE</code>. That
will give you a lot of GNU library extensions, but it will not give you <code>__int128</code> support.
libstdc++ is looking specifically for the two macros defined above, and <code>-D_GNU_SOURCE</code>
doesn’t enable those macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="relationship-to-integer-types-and-intmax_t">Relationship to integer types and <code>intmax_t</code></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libstdc++ (in standard, non-<code>gnu++XX</code> mode) leaves <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> as <code>false</code>.
This makes a certain amount of sense from the library implementor’s point of view,
because <code>__int128</code> is not one of the <em>standard</em> integral types, and furthermore,
if you <em>call</em> it integral, then you have to face the consequence that <code>intmax_t</code>
(which is 64 bits on every ABI that matters) is kind of lying about being the
“max.”</p>

<p>In <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ makes <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> come out to <code>true</code>,
as described in the previous section on sneaky macros.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, libc++ simply
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/aeeba70ab15e1469841c0f3f1f9c78211a541699/include/type_traits#L738-L741">sets</a>
sets <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>, unconditionally.</p>

<p>Yes, this means that on libc++ (or on libstdc++ with <code>-std=gnu++17</code>), there exist
integral values that do not fit in <code>intmax_t</code>! (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/lMD4Iu">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you’re wondering: libstdc++ in standard C++17 mode considers <code>__int128</code> a “compound” type.
The definition of “compound type” is simply “anything that’s not a fundamental type,”
where “fundamental” encompasses the arithmetic types (both integral and floating-point), <code>void</code>,
and <code>nullptr_t</code>. So for example <code>int*</code> is also a compound type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="numeric-limits">Numeric limits</h2>

<p>In standard (non-<code>gnu++XX</code>) mode, libstdc++ does not specialize <code>numeric_limits</code> for <code>__int128</code> at all.
This <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/RpaD-7">has the unfortunate effect</a> of</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constexpr __int128 int128_max =
    std::numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max();
static_assert(int128_max == 0);  // TRUE on libstdc++ in standard mode
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) provides the appropriate specialization, so that
<code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::min()</code> and <code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max()</code>
have the appropriate values instead of zero.</p>

<p>On libc++ <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ZR_nn6"><code>numeric_limits</code> reports <code>__int128</code> as an integral type</a>,
whereas on libstdc++ in standard mode it doesn’t (again because there is no specialization for
<code>__int128</code> at all).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;I128&gt;::is_integer);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="signedness">Signedness</h2>

<p>libc++ reports that <code>is_signed_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> and <code>is_unsigned_v&lt;unsigned __int128&gt;</code>.
libstdc++ in standard mode of course denies both, because only arithmetic types can be
signed or unsigned, and libstdc++ denies that <code>__int128</code> is arithmetic.</p>

<p>As for <code>make_signed</code>, libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) reports what you’d expect —
<code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__int128_t</code>, and <code>make_unsigned&lt;__int128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to instantiate <code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;</code> on libstdc++ in standard mode
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/j7BvKB">results in</a> a hard error which is not SFINAE-friendly.
(It’s undefined behavior to instantiate <code>make_signed</code> of any type which is neither
integral nor an enumeration type.)</p>

<p>Incidentally, today I learned that <code>is_signed_v&lt;float&gt; == true</code> but <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/t6v1CJ"><code>make_signed_t&lt;float&gt;</code>
is a hard error</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2020/02/13/wide-integer-proof-of-concept/">“The abstraction penalty for wide integer math on x86-64”</a> (2020-02-13).</p>

It's the first post you'd want to read before learning the specifics of React. I'll explain the core ideas of React in plain English (and doodles <span>🌴</span>). No JavaScript experience? No problem! As long as you have some basic HTML knowledge (e.g. the format of an HTML tag), you should be able to enjoy this article.</p><p>This is a bird's-eye view <span>🦅</span> but I'll also equip you with a pair of binoculars <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="25" height="25" viewBox="0 -48 512 512"><g fill="#40404c"><path d="M211.023 137.027h89.95v145.938h-89.95zm0 0M298.3

Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your computer:</strong> Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?</p><p><strong>The server:</strong> Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?</p><p>Using this information, the browser creates something called... the DOM!</p><div><p><img alt="Introducing the DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Wait a second, the DOM is a ... tree? Yup, a tree! Oddly enough, a lot of things in our computer look like a tree. Let's give our tree friend a nickname... hmm what about Domo?</p><p>Domo works as a model at the prestigious art studio "Web Browser". His job is to pose in front of the artist who paints a portrait (or perhaps millions of portraits).</p><div><p><img alt="Domo at the art studio Web Browser" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In real life, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's indeed a model -- a model of the document (aka the web page). It strikes a pose. The browser paints a portrait. The portraits are what we see on a web page: the textboxes, the paragraphs, the images and so on. A developer's job is like that of a director who tells Domo what to wear and what pose to strike. This determines what those portraits look like in the end.</p><p>To check out what the DOM looks like, if you are using a desktop browser, right-click on this very page and choose "Inspect".

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry!

This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly.

The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>.

    <p>Lately I have been working on improving texture atlas allocation in WebRender. It isn't an outstanding technical feat, but the journey towards achieving this goal was quite pleasant. </p>
<p>This is a longer version of the piece I published in the <a href="https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/improving-texture-atlas-allocation-in-webrender/">mozilla gfx team blog</a> where I focus on the atlas allocation algorithms. In this one I'll go into more details about the process and methodology behind these improvements.</p>
<p>The first part is about the making of guillotiere, a crate that I first released in March 2019. In the second part we'll have a look at more recent work building upon what I did with guillotiere, to improve texture memory usage in WebRender/Firefox.</p>

<p>In order to submit work to the GPU efficiently, WebRender groups as many drawing primitives as it can into what we call batches. A batch is submitted to the GPU as a single drawing command and has a few constraints. for example a batch can only reference a fixed set of resources (such as GPU buffers and textures). So in order to group as many drawing primitives as possible in a single batch we need to place as many drawing parameters as possible in few resources. When rendering text, WebRender pre-renders the glyphs before compositing them on the screen  so this means packing as many pre-rendered glyphs as possible into a single texture, and the same applies for rendering images and various other things.</p>
<p>For a moment let's simplify the case of images and text and assume that it is the same problem: input images (rectangles) of various rectangular sizes that we need to pack into a larger rectangle. This is the job of the texture atlas allocator. Another common name for this is rectangle bin packing.</p>
<p><img alt="Atlas allocation" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/atlas-allocation.svg"></p>
<p>Many in game and web development are used to packing many images into fewer assets. In most cases this can be achieved at build time Which means that the texture atlas allocator only needs to find a good layout for a fixed set of rectangles without supporting dynamic deallocation and allocation within the atlas at run time. I call this "static" atlas allocation as opposed to "dynamic" atlas allocation.</p>
<p>There's a lot more literature out there about static than dynamic atlas allocation. I recommend reading <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a> which is a very good survey of various static packing algorithms. Dynamic atlas allocation is unfortunately more difficult to implement while keeping good run-time performance. WebRender needs to maintain texture atlases into which items are added and removed over time. In other words we don't have a way around needing dynamic atlas allocation.</p>

<p>A while back, WebRender had a naive implementation of the guillotine algorithm (explained in <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a>). This algorithm strikes a good compromise between packing quality and implementation complexity.
The main idea behind it can be explained simply: "Maintain a list of free rectangles, find one that can hold your allocation, split the requested allocation size out of it, creating up to two additional rectangles that are added back to the free list.". There is subtlety in which free rectangle to choose and how to split it, but the overall, the algorithm is built upon reassuringly understandable concepts.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation steps" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-alloc.svg"></p>
<p>Deallocation could simply consist of adding the deallocated rectangle back to the free list, but without some way to merge back neighbor free rectangles, the atlas would quickly get into a fragmented stated with a lot of small free rectangles and can't allocate larger ones anymore.</p>
<p><img alt="Fragmented state" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/fragmented.svg"></p>
<p>To address that, WebRender's implementation would regularly do a O(n²) complexity search to find and merge neighbor free rectangles, which was very slow when dealing with thousands of items. Eventually we stopped using the  guillotine allocator in systems that needed support for deallocation, replacing it with a very simple slab allocator which I'll get back to later in this post.</p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with moving to a worse allocator because of the run-time defragmentation issue, so as a side project I wrote a guillotine allocator that tracks rectangle splits in a tree in order to find and merge neighbor free rectangle in constant instead of quadratic time. I published it in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/guillotiere">guillotiere</a> crate. I wrote about how it works in details in <a href="https://docs.rs/guillotiere/0.6.0/guillotiere/struct.AtlasAllocator.html">the documentation</a> so I won't go over it here. I'm quite happy about how it turned out, although I haven't pushed to use it in WebRender, mostly because I wanted to first see evidence that it would help and I already had evidence that many other things needed to be worked on.</p>
<h2>Visualizing program state using SVG</h2>
<p>guillotiere lets you dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG format.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-example-1.svg"></p>
<p>The image above shows the state of the atlas after a few allocations. Allocated space is represented in light blue while free space is in dark gray. It is much easier to work with than a list of coordinates in plain text. It was handy when developing and tuning the algorithm, but also when using it in other projects. While looking at the visual representation of the state animate you quickly develop an intuition of how the algorithm unfolds Concepts that are hard to explain in written form sometimes just "make sense" visually.</p>
<p>Dumping visual representations in a .svg file is not only a powerful tool when exploring problem some spaces, it is also surprisingly simple to do. SVG is a straightforward XML type of format which is annoying to type by hand but effortless to generate with very simple helpers. Here is how it looks using a tiny helper crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/svg_fmt">svg_fmt</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>    </span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>svg_fmt</span>::<span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span>

</code></pre></div>


<p>So many useful visualizations can be easily built out of simple colored rectangles and text and there's other primitives provided by svg_fmt. Rectangles were all I needed in guillotiere.</p>
<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/nical/rust_debug/blob/492600cac47f64bcadaf9ad037ed64c5fecc8e63/svg_fmt/src/svg.rs">how simple the svg_fmt code is</a>. It has become a dependency to most of the things I've worked on lately, including WebRender which uses it to dump visualizations of texture atlases and the render graph.</p>
<p><img alt="Render graph visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/rendergraph.svg"></p>
<p>My hope by now is that if you are working on problems that can be represented in 2D space, I've managed to convince you of how easily you can supplement or break free of reading text in your debugger/terminal. If anything, just <code>println!(r#"&lt;rect x="{}" y="{}" width="{}" height="{}" fill:rgb(100,0,0)" /&gt;""#, x, y, w, h);</code> your way into looking at your algorithms unfolding.</p>
<h2>Making/testing/debugging a small rust crate</h2>
<p>I had a great time writing guillotiere for several reasons. The problem itself had some nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a well defined problem with simple input and output data. As a result it is very easy to write unit tests and fuzz the code.</li>
<li>No nebulous design space for fancy abstractions. A retained state, query a size in, get a rectangle out. Simple.</li>
<li>Can be implemented in its own library outside of a big rendering engine, and enjoy fast compile/debug iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the Rust programming language and ecosystem that really made it a such pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping a simple library, creating unit tests, adding dependencies is simple and effortless in Rust. This alone is a huge time saver for me compared to when I would do this sort of thing in C++ (I can only hope that the situation has improved in C++ since). Fellow Rust developers are pretty used to that so let's move on.</p>
<p>I quickly wrote a simple command-line application to interactively play with the packing algorithm.
The application deserializes the state of the atlas from a file, execute a command (for example allocation or deallocation) and serializes back into the file (using the .ron file format). In addition, the command-line application could dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG.</p>
<p>The command-line app was put together very quickly thanks to fantastic pieces of the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">serde</a> for serialization/deserialzation,</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/ron">ron</a> providing a nice and readable serialized file format,</li>
<li>and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> for parsing command-line arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together, this gave me an interactive playground to test the algorithm. Playing around in a terminal would look like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ guillotiere init <span>1024</span> <span>1024</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>16</span> <span>32</span>
Allocated rectangle r1 of size 16x32 at origin <span>[</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>200</span> <span>100</span> --svg <span>01</span>.svg
Allocated rectangle r2 of size 200x100 at origin <span>[</span><span>16</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere deallocate r1 --svg <span>02</span>.svg

etc...
</code></pre></div>


<p>At any time in that sequence of commands I can open the <code>atlas.ron</code> file and read the state of the atlas as if I was in a debugger, can also copy it around to save the state in a way that almost feels as powerful as using <a href="https://rr-project.org/">record-and-replay debugging</a>.</p>
<h2>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>I mentioned fuzzing earlier. <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz">Cargo fuzz</a> is a joy and I really recommend using it whenever possible. It's very easy to setup, I wouldn't necessarily run it on every push, but every once in a while to find some bugs and/or get a bit of confidence about the robustness of your code. It's great. It has plenty of well written <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/">documentation</a> so I won't go into details here. I'll just mention that it's a very well made piece of Rust's ecosystem that contributes to the greatness of the whole in my opinion.</p>

<p>Fast forward the end of 2020. Ah 2020.</p>
<p>I was investigating further improvements to draw call batching and texture upload overhead which are big performance bottlenecks on low end Intel GPUs, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Gathering some statistics about what causes new batches to be generated shows that it is often happening when multiple primitives use the same shader but are …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

<p>I recently lost access to a free email account I’ve had since before I can remember (though only temporarily, thank the lord). When it happened, I instantly became effectively uncontactable by a large portion of humanity. My own temporary disappearance from reality started me to thinking about how we can reuse existing infrastructure to store contact information in a durable and highly available way.</p>

<h2 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h2>

<p>My requirements for a durable contact storage solution are (in no particular order):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Public: No authentication shoudl be required to read someone’s contact information.</li>
  <li>Globally accessible: Anyone should be able to read the information at any time, from anywhere</li>
  <li>Highly available: It should (almost) never go down. One company going bankrupt or changing strategic direction shouldn’t kill it.</li>
  <li>Censorship resistant: It should only be possible to take down records with a court order. Corporate censorship should be impossible, or at least historically infrequent.</li>
  <li>Cheap: But not free! Free services come with few no guarantees, and even fewer rights for their users.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance: User only needs to get involved when the data needs to change. No operational burden</li>
  <li>Easy to use: Clients should be able to read information trivially.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of services that check some of these boxes. Twitter for instance does pretty well, but fails badly on 3, 4 &amp; 5. This is where most services fall down, so I focused there. After pondering this for a while, I realized that we’ve already got a great solution that checks all the boxes: DNS.</p>

<h3 id="highly-available">Highly available</h3>

<p>There are many services that are highly available in the technical sense, meaning they rarely crash, but suffer from economic risk. The ultimate crash is the business that provides the service going bankrupt or changing strategic direction. DNS doesn’t suffer from the same economic risk that centralized services do because there are many, many independent registrars and DNS service providers out there.</p>

<h3 id="censorship-resistance">Censorship resistance</h3>

<p>I would argue that DNS registries are censorship <em>resistant</em> based on the historical record. Whatever you think about the situation, the fact is Parler the application got vaporized in a day, but Parler.com is still registered. The Pirate Bay is one of the most taken down sites in history, and thepiratebay.org is still registered.</p>

<h3 id="cheap">Cheap</h3>

<p>This one is easy. There are loads of registrars that sell a variety of gTLD subdomains, complete with DNS service, for less than $10 per year. Enough said.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h3>

<p>DNS does so well on the other requirements, it’s a shame that we’d have to use some arcane protocol to query it. Oh wait…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=landshark.io&amp;type=TXT'  | jq -r .Answer[].data

"v=me; email=alan.gibson@gmail.com"
"v=me; twitter=handheld"
"v=me; blog=https://landshark.io"
"v=me; gravatar=https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123456"
"v=me; bitcoin=123456789"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DNS over HTTP (DoH) means DNS is now trivially easy to query and hard to snoop on. Not too shabby.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-way">A better way</h3>

<p>On the Internet, I’m alan.gibson@gmail.com, as well as twitter.com/handheld, news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alangibson, and so many more. Wouldn’t it be alot simpler if  we used DNS TXT records to store all those various identifiers in one place so that you could find me anywhere just by knowing that I’m landshark.io?</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty slick solution to me. What do you think? <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26024845">Discussion is happening in this Hacker News thread.</a></p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

                <h3>My Most Productive Project Stack</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>I have started literally hundreds of side projects and never finished any that had any sort of substance. The
projects I tend to be most successful with finishing are those I can complete in one sitting or at most one weekend
(I have made A LOT of telegram bots).</p>
<p>However, I recently <em>actually</em> finished a side project that took me multiple months… and I think i’ll be
able to do it again. By seeing a project through to completion, I learnt a lot about keeping myself motivated and,
perhaps more importantly, which tools <em>stayed (mostly) out of the way</em> to enable me to focus on the idea rather than
battling with errors.</p>
<p>This blog post is going to focus on the stack I used, and I will write another on how I launched sponsorasong and what I
learnt.</p>

<p>I have done my fair share of fundraising over the past century or so. The current options of fundraising platforms are a
little mechanical, and I felt there was a room for a little gamification (and fun).</p>
<p><a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">https://sponsorasong.com</a> is an idea I have had in my head for a long time. The concept is a fairly simple one. Here’s an
excerpt from the Product hunt launch Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sponsor a song is a fun, new and exciting way to fundraise.</p>
<p>Those who are completing an event create a Spotify playlist and commit to listen to it
whilst they complete the event. Each person who donates gets to select one song to add
to the fundraiser’s playlist. Will you be kind and add a motivational track that you
know will help your friend hit a Personal Best or will you scheme with others to ensure
they have to listen to baby shark on repeat for the entirety of a marathon?</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t be a good “founder” (I dislike this term for myself but am unsure how else to refer to myself)
if I didn’t use this as an opportunity to try and drive you to the site so if the above
does sound interesting, please check it out <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When selecting items for the tech stack I prioritised for rapid development, speed of deployment and ease of
maintenance. I landed on the following items, and I’ll talk through why I think each of them was a great choice and why
I’ll pick them again in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers and CDN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nextjs">Next.js</h2>
<p>next.js is the “app” framework I have been looking for for a long time. I’m a backend engineer by trade, and find
frontend development pretty challenging due to the speed at which the space moves and CORS issues amongst other things.
If you have even basic React knowledge, after a quick tour of the docs, next.js makes development rapid.</p>
<p>Next.js has a hot reload server all ready to go, and every change you make is instantly shown in the browser. It comes
with an opinionated project structure, handles routing for you and more importantly for me
includes the ability to write server side code right next to your client side code and pass it as props.</p>
<p>The below code is enough to make a http call on the server, get the response, pass it to the frontend and display it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>function</span> <span>Page</span>({<span>data</span>}) {

</code></pre></div><p>This allowed me to prototype and iterate really quickly. Previously I have used Create React App and then built a separate
backend using Go or Node and switched between the code bases depending on which piece I was working on.</p>
<p>The only challenged I faced with next was when I tried to introduce some client side libraries. Next.js sometimes blurs
what is going to be executed in the frontend and what will be Server Side rendered and can make debugging issues tricky.
This could very well be due to my lack of expertise in this space though.</p>
<h2 id="vercel">Vercel</h2>
<p><a href="https://mattjamesboyle.com/posts/productive-start-up-stack/vercel.com">Vercel</a> used to be called zeit.co and before that it was now.sh. I have used it over the years to deploy static
sites (this blog was previously hosted there, its now on Cloudflare workers). However, when starting a next.js project it
pushes you towards using Vercel to deployment as it  will “just work”. To get the project deploying using Vercel,
according to the docs, you simply need to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sign up to Vercel.</li>
<li>After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).</li>
<li>Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!</li>
<li>After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience it really is that simple.</p>
<p>Once setup, everytime I pushed to master, a minute or 2 later my code changes were reflected on my domain. This is a really
powerful and rapid workflow, much better than anything else I have used before (which usually involved deploying multiple
containers with NGINX in front of them).</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers--cdn">Cloudflare Workers &amp; CDN</h2>
<p>I’m sure you are not surprised to see Cloudflare here. I use Cloudflare for all my domain management and get page rules,
HTTPS, caching, DDOS protection and analytics for very little effort. As well as this, I used <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a>
to schedule some code I wrote to check which campaigns need to be marked as closed and update their status in the Database.
I used the Hello World template from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/starters">here</a> and then just set up a
cron to execute the code daily in the dashboard. Wrangler made development of this very simple and was much easier than
having to set up a crontab on a linux box or deploying a cronjob to a kubernetes instance (again, how I have done this
previously).</p>
<h2 id="stripe">Stripe</h2>
<p>I needed a means to take payments, and I had some experience using Stripe. However, even if I didn’t, it is so easy to get
going and they provide so many different examples, it will be my go to for every side project.  For next.js, there is even
<a href="https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe">this</a> fantastic guide to getting it all hooked up!</p>
<p>As well as helping you capture transactions easily, Stripe also provides a great dashboard for managing payouts,refunds,
disputes etc. For a lot of use cases, this means you won’t need to build out a back office system which is a huge time saver!
Up to now, the Stripe dashboard has fulfilled all my needs and I have no plans to build anything custom. I am interested
to see how long this remains the case though as I develop more complex features.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-relational-database-service">Amazon Relational Database Service</h2>
<p>I’m not sure Amazon is the cheapest or the most user friendly way to create a database, but I have experience using it and
I think one key takeaway for me for rapid development is to <em>use what you know</em>. I’m currently using the AWS free tier  Postgres
db  and with my current throughput I won’t need to upgrade anytime soon. When developing locally, I use docker-compose and
a postgres image.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The above tools helped me developer <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">sponsor a song</a> in record time (for me) and stay motivated as I got to spend most of my time
developing features rather than battling tools. I would use all the above mentioned tools again (and intend to!).</p>
<p>I intend to write a follow-up post with how I launched the project and how it went in the next coming days.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: I have an idea; not sure what to do next; guide on metrics to set in order to achieve a seed round or Series A.]</p> <h3 id="0-getting-started">0: Getting Started</h3> <p>Say you're working on a project somewhere. It might not even be a company. Nobody cares about what you're doing. How the heck will this turn into Stripe, for chrissake? "Get more users", they say. "Get revenue", they say.</p> <p>But what does that even <em>mean</em>? That sounds vague, big, ominous, and unquantifiable. And the other games, like improving <em>just a little bit</em> at getting your boss to like you or answering email feel <em>very</em> achievable. Very clear what to do next.</p> <p>The reason there aren't more startups is because it's a weird game to play. The differential in scores is giant, and the next action to take unclear. And especially when starting, <em>it's all headwind</em>. There is no inertia of success. It's really not clear what to do if you want to start SpaceX. Elon's score on the leaderboard is so large it feels useless to play the game.</p> <p>I’ve found it most useful to turn this challenge into something that feels achievable. To work as expediently as possible to get to a point where you're performing for <em>real, paying users</em> instead of your local friends, Boss, or whatever.</p> <p>This is a playbook for how to get started with very bite-sized, achievable steps. (BTW, this blog post has been implemented into software! Try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/launcher">Pioneer Launcher</a>.)</p> <h3 id="week-1-10-friends">Week #1: 10 Friends</h3> <p>Building SpaceX feels infinitely far away. But everything big starts small. Just focus on showing your product to 10 people this week. Just ten. This can be in the real world, over Zoom, whatever. Distant cousins or friends. Ten people, that is all. In the ever-connected era of the Internet, this should be very doable. Focus on the amount of interaction you have with them, not just hitting the number.</p> <p>You want these 10 people to be your base. Your core. You'll be using them as motivational fuel over the next few weeks. So make sure they really care about what you're building.</p> <p>Open iMessage. Start scrolling down. Send invites to whoever is recent. Think of yourself as planning a small party, but on the Internet instead of a bar.</p> <h3 id="week-2-100-chats">Week #2: 100 Chats</h3> <p>This is the most important step. Let's imagine the above took a week. I would then try to get to 100 users by the end of this month.</p> <p>You don't have to <em>meet</em> these people. You just need to get 100 people chatting with you. A WhatsApp group that's filled with excitable users who adore your product. If you did 10 users last week, just step it up to 20, 30, then 40 over the next 3 weeks.</p> <p>It'll get easier as you go along, both due to viral referrals and because you'll have an audience to perform for. Something to show people. That alone will give you motivational fuel.</p> <p>This, in my opinion, is the key step. Once you build your own club of 100 truly delighted customers, the feedback loop will kick in. You'll want to perform for them.</p> <h3 id="week-5-1000-revenue">Week #5: $1,000 Revenue</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to 100 users, you might want to think about getting to $1,000 <em>dollars</em> in revenue. This shouldn't be too hard.</p> <p>All you need to do is 20% of your users (let's imagine 80% refuse) to pay you $50. Twenty people, fifty dollars. Talk to them. Figure out what they'll pay for. Build that. (It helps that you first focused on getting them to love you, they'll be more responsive.)</p> <p>You have a 100 users. Assuredly you can ask all of them this week?</p> <h3 id="week-6-10000-arr">Week #6: $10,000 ARR</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to $1,000 in revenue, it's time to get to $10,000 in ARR. This may sound large, but it's a forgiving metric. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue, and it really only means that you need to get those same 20 people paying you $50, but each month. (These numbers are just defaults. You should be adjusting. It might be only 5 users paying you $200 a month, or 1,000 paying you $1 a month.)</p> <p>Do what makes sense to you, but make the goal achievable for yourself. Play a game you can win.</p> <p>If you make it this far quickly, we'll gladly fund you. We'll incorporate your company, fly you out to Silicon Valley, the whole shebang. (I can't blindly commit to this, obviously! But the odds are very, very high.)</p> <hr> <p>Concluding: just try and build a club of 100 people in WhatsApp in the next 30 days. Forget SpaceX, forget Stripe, or Airbnb. Get 100 loving users in a chatroom, and everything else will follow. If you need an extra jolt, check out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a>.

  	<div><p>A <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter">bitonic sorting network</a> lays out <em>a sequence of compare-and swap operations</em> that, when applied to an array of sortable elements, sorts these elements.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/strip.png" alt="Major steps in bitonic merge sort" title="Major steps in bitonic merge sort">
<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 0:</strong> Major steps of a bitonic merge sorting network applied to 1024 sortable elements.<p>The pixels in the final square are sorted by brightness, left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="why-bitonic-merge-sort">Why Bitonic Merge Sort?&nbsp;<a href="#why-bitonic-merge-sort"></a></h2>
<p>The beauty of this algorithm is that it maps really well onto parallel hardware, such as a GPU, where it has constant and relatively low performance complexity <span>\(  O(\log^2(n)) \)</span>. That is to say: It's <strong>quite fast</strong>. The implementation I'm discussing here was able to sort 1M random ints in 4ms. Compared to the 40ms I measured for C++'s <code>std::sort</code>, that's a 10x speedup! On top of that, for a given number of sortable elements, it will always take the same amount of time to complete.</p>
<p>When the algorithm executes, each worker thread performs one single operation for every pair of sortable elements: compare-and-swap. But how to choose the correct pairings for sortable elements? This is where the algorithm's complexity is buried.</p>
<h2 id="constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network">Constructing a Bitonic Sorting Network&nbsp;<a href="#constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network"></a></h2>
<p>First, let's look at a diagram of a relatively small sorting network, say, for 16 sortable elements. The diagram is for the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter#Alternative_representation">alternative representation of a bitonic sorting network</a>, as I found it on wikipedia. I prefer this version because it is slightly simpler: all worker threads use the same direction for their compare-and-swap operations.</p>
</div>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort.svg">
<figcaption>
	    <p><strong>Fig.1:</strong> Sorting diagram for 16 sortable elements<br>Horizontal lines represent array indices into our array of sortable elements, each vertical line represents one worker thread performing a compare-and-swap operation.
	    </p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div>
<p>In the diagram, each worker thread is drawn as a vertical line, with the start- and endpoints marking the indices of the current pair of sortable elements. All coloured blocks which are in the same column form a step, wich can be executed in parallel. We can see from the diagram that the number of threads per step is constant, and that it is always <code>n/2</code>, with <code>n</code> being the number of sortable elements.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to figuring out sort index pairs for each worker thread based on each thread's execution step and thread number, lets take a step back, look at the diagram through squinted eyes and see if some patters emerge if we group similar looking blocks together.</p>
<h2 id="we-can-point-out-some-macro-patterns">We can point out some macro patterns:&nbsp;<a href="#we-can-point-out-some-macro-patterns"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Green block: doubles in height until it reaches total number of
elements. Let's call such a block <strong>flip</strong></li>
<li>Yellow block: after each green block, there is a cascade of yellow
blocks, each half the previous height, until its height spans only
two sortable elements. Let's call such a block <strong>disperse</strong></li>
<li>Blocks are <strong>periodic</strong> within their column.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can write the following pseudo-code:</p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span><span>7
</span><span>8
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> n <span>=</span> <span>16</span>; <span>// n is our total number of sortable elements, must be power of 2
</span><span></span>
<span>for</span> (<span>int</span> h <span>=</span> <span>2</span>; h <span>&lt;</span><span>=</span> n; h <span>*</span><span>=</span> <span>2</span>) { 
    do_flip(h);

        do_disperse(hh);
    }
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><h2 id="look-at-inner-patterns">Look at inner patterns:&nbsp;<a href="#look-at-inner-patterns"></a></h2>
<p>Looking at the diagram again, we see that each of the two block types, green and yellow, follow distinct patterns for how each worker thread grabs pairs of sortable elements:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort_non_repeating.svg" alt="Diagram BMS non-repeating" title="Diagram BMS non-repeating">
<figcaption>
    While worker thread lines inside green ("flip") blocks start at full height and converge towards the centre, in yellow ("disperse") blocks they start at half height, and then shift down. We also note that the only variable controlling the pattern is the overall height <code>h</code> of a yellow or green block.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can therefore split the problem in two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for green (“flip”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for yellow (“disperse”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks">Index pairs for “flip” (green) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Let's enumerate sortable element index pairs from our green blocks, and label them <span>\(  T_{0\dots t} \)</span>, where <span>\(  t \)</span> represents the worker thread index to which a sortable element index pair is assigned to:</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:3], T_1[1:2]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:7], T_1 [1:6], T_2 [2:5], T_3 [3:4]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ t : h-t-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks">Index pairs for “disperse” (yellow) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Similarly, if we enumerate index pairs for yellow blocks we get</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:2], T_1[1:3]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:4], T_1 [1:5], T_2 [2:6], T_3 [3:7]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [t : t + h/2], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="rules-for-rows-of-blocks">Rules for rows of blocks&nbsp;<a href="#rules-for-rows-of-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Now, let's look at the diagram again.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort.svg" alt="Diagram BMS" title="Diagram BMS">
<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 3:</strong> <br>Our original diagram
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We notice that both green and yellow blocks repeat vertically until they fill out the full height of their column. We can model this repetition as a combination of modulo (the pattern is the same <em>within</em> a block) and an <span>integer-division based offset</span><span>: basically, for the offset, we quantize the <code>t</code> signal at <code>h</code>-resolution</span>.</p>
<p>As a first step, we make sure both rules for green and yellow blocks are contained within their respective height, <span>\(  h \)</span>. Note that we define these rules now for the total number of sortable elements, <span>\(  n \)</span> instead of the earlier <span>\(  h \)</span>. Instead of using <span>\(  t \)</span> “unbounded”, we introduce a new term around <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t\bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + h-(t \bmod \frac{h}{2})-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) + \frac{h}{2}], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
<p>What does the new term <span>\(  (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) \)</span> do? It limits the output for the term for any given <span>\(  t \)</span> to <span>\(  0,\dots,h/2 \)</span>, something you will recognise as a condition for our earlier rules.</p>
<p>You will also have noted that both rules introduced a new variable <span>\(  q \)</span>, which represents the offset. We can express <span>\(  q \)</span> fully as a function of <span>\(  h \)</span> and <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p><span>\(  q = \lfloor{ (\frac{2t}{h}) } * h \)</span></p>
<p>In pseudo-code, this translates to:</p>

<p>Now that we have a reliable and tested method to generate index pairs, we can take a stab at implementing the algorithm using Vulkan Compute.</p>
<p>In Vulkan, compute tasks require us to bind a compute pipeline - which is thankfully very simple and takes a single compute shader. We'll get to the code for the compute shader in a little bit, but for now, let's look at what we need to specify in order to dispatch a compute command:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5

    uint32_t                                    groupCountZ);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>We need to find the group counts in <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> dimension for our dispatch command. Since we want each compute command to execute <span>one step of our bitonic sorting grid</span><span> (that's one vertical slice)</span>, let's stick to a one-dimensional invocation: I'm setting <code>groupCountY = 1</code> and <code>groupCountZ = 1</code>, since these values must be at minimum 1.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx">What do we set for <code>groupCountX</code>?&nbsp;<a href="#what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx"></a></h2>
<p>Well, this will depend on the size of our workgroup, and the total number of sortable elements. Let's say we have <span>\(  n=16 \)</span> sortable elements. This means, we will need <span>\(  \frac{n}{2} = 8 \)</span> worker threads. Let's say each workgroup contains 8 worker threads, this means we would need to call our dispatch with a <code>groupCountX</code> of 1.</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p>Every invocation triggers one workgroup of thread workers. In shade code, we can specify how many threads we want to have per work-group, by specifying <code>local_size_x</code>, and in this particular case, we would choose 8.</p>

<p>Now, let's look at a first stab at a shader implementation for bitonic merge sort:</p>

This depicted that early humans must have been using animal skins to wrap themselves in the still warm hides.

Then they discovered that by drying the animal skin in sun and using salt to dehydrate, the natural rotting process of animal skin stopped. Once the skin is dried, they transformed it into clothing, shelters, and footwear.</p><p>Learn more about the origins of leather <span><a href="http://www.all-about-leather.co.uk/what-is-leather/where-does-leather-come-from.htm"><b>here</b></a></span>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="230a4e2" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="c1e8de3" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9d58faf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>The Rich History of Leather</h3></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="976a119" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="f4dab9f" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9c0661f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="892" height="787" src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" alt="Leather History" loading="lazy" srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22892%22%20height%3D%22787%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20892%20787%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22b%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2212%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23a4a4a4%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h892v783H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%22url(%23b)%22%20transform%3D%22translate(1.7%201.7)%20scale(3.48438)%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23fff%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-91.2%20170.4%2041.6)%20scale(20.11624%20212.13655)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23797979%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(78.64675%202.45608%20-2.79717%2089.569%20110.5%2097)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dadada%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-102.6%20149.9%20-74.2)%20scale(64.09721%2043.26718)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dbdbdb%22%20cy%3D%22179%22%20rx%3D%2218%22%20ry%3D%22225%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" data-srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="f130238" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="39134aa" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="1d912fa" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>The discovery of leather is known to be one of the earliest founds of man in history.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I gambled…</p><p>I hoped Apple would do the right thing by developers who paid for access to the Developer Transition Kit (DTK) to get the first Apple Silicon Macs, but I was wrong and I lost.</p><blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE - 6 Feb 2020:</strong> Apple has responded to feedback from me and other disgruntled developers and so I didn’t lose as much as I thought. Apple is now giving US $500 credit, which is what developers in the US paid for the DTK, and they are extending the time limit to the end of the year. I am quite certain they will release a desktop M1 Mac before then, so I will get credit for most of the cost of the DTK (after exchange rate losses) and I will be able to use the credit towards a Mac that I want.</p><p>Thanks Apple for listening and reacting.</p></blockquote><hr><p>I paid Apple AU $779 for a year’s lease on a DTK which was effectively a Mac mini with an iPad CPU.
I also had to buy a monitor to use with it.</p><p>That was in June 2020.</p><p>In November 2020, the M1 was released which made the A14Z based DTK totally irrelevant for testing or development, so the lease effectively only lasted for 5 months. At that I was luckier than many devs as a lot of these DTK machines started failing at around the 4 month mark.</p><ul><li>I kept Apple’s secrets.</li><li>I tested their hardware and software.</li><li>I filed bug reports, a couple of which even got acknowledged.</li></ul><p>And in return, I get asked to send back the DTK some months early for which I will get the princely reward of US $200 credit.</p><p>When Apple switched over to Intel CPUs, they gave the DTK buyers a free computer when they returned the DTK, but of course Apple wasn’t a trillion dollar company back then so they could afford to be generous. (How does one indicate heavy sarcasm in text?)</p><p>I don’t want a laptop, I want a desktop Mac, so there is nothing to spend my $200 credit on yet, but as a final sting in the tail, Apple has decreed that the credit expires at the end of May 2021. There is no guarantee that there will be desktop Mac to buy before then. Only Apple knows that and they have made me cynical enough to consider that they might decide not to release any new Macs until after these credits expire.</p><p>I realize that Apple made no commitment to do anything after the DTK program was over, but history indicated they would.</p><p>The smallness of the credit and the short time limit on it seem unnecessarily petty and punitive, especially when the people they are punishing are the ones that add so much value to the Apple platforms.</p><p>Assuming I have to get a laptop, I will want a high-powered one as it will have to be able to run Xcode. Apple’s flagship developer tool is famously demanding.</p><ul><li><p>In the US, the one I want costs US $1,899</p></li><li><p>Here in Australia, it is AU $2,899 - 1.53 times the US price.</p></li></ul><p>The US$200 credit will use the exchange rate at 23 December 2020, which for USD - AUD was 1.3218 which is significantly lower than the ratio in Apple’s pricing between the two countries.</p><p>This means that I will get AU $264.36 for my credit, which is 9% of the cost of the computer to replace it, even though that is not the computer I actually want.</p><p>Financially, I would have been much better off waiting until the M1s were released. But Apple needed the early machines tested, so they suckered us in and then slapped us in the face.</p><p>I wonder how Tim Cook and the others can stand up again and again and say that they value their developers. Does that not make them feel ashamed? Or maybe they struggle not to laugh while saying it?</p><p>Thanks Apple.</p><p>And good luck finding suckers to test your next round of new hardware.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>While Tinybird is not a log analysis tool per se, it’s a tool that you can use as the foundation to analyze logs-like datasets at scale. Here you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>how to use it to analyze NGINX logs</li> <li>how to publish your SQL queries as API endpoints to be used in other tools</li> <li>and how to model your data sources and endpoints to make it 10X faster.</li> </ul> <p>An NGINX log looks like this:</p>  <p>It’s not a CSV file but a “space separated file” so in principle Tinybird wouldn’t load it because we just support CSV files. But if we analyze the file using our <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">CLI tool</a>:</p>  <p>The delimiter is guessed so it can be loaded.</p>  <p>The format looks like this:</p>  <p>We need to transform it to something useful. To transform data we use a pipe.</p>  <p>Now let’s query the new pipe:</p>  <p>You could now publish an endpoint:</p>  <p>So far so good. But what happens when you have millions of entries a day, the generated endpoints wouldn’t be as fast as needed. For example, for endpoints serving real time dashboards, where the user can pick different date ranges, add filters and so on, waiting for more than a second is not the best solution. So there is an easy solution: generate views as data arrives.</p> <p>So, let’s create a Materialized view (MV from now on) for the previous endpoint:</p>  <p>There are many things to notice:</p> <ul> <li>The materialized view SQL is almost the same than the endpoint but instead of count it uses countState and the same for avg. Those -State modifiers are needed when pushing data to a MV. The datasource where the MV pushes the data has two columns with a special data type to store those <code>-State</code></li> <li>The Engine is not the regular MergeTree, it’s an <code>AggregatingMergeTree</code> that tells ClickHouse to aggregate columns on merge operations (executed periodically, you don’t need to worry about that)</li> <li>The sorting key tells ClickHouse which column we are grouping by</li> </ul> <p>We push the files</p>  <p>We use <code>--push-deps</code> to upload all the dependencies and <code>--populate</code> to fill the materialized view with the data already in <code>log_transform</code></p> <p>Now we check the amount of rows in that table:</p>  <p>If we push new data with new IP addresses, the amount of rows will rise but, comparing the amount of rows in the original table with the MV datasource, you can understand why it is going to be faster. And the good thing - this table is updated when you push new data, it does not need to be recalculated.</p>  <p>The last thing is to change the endpoint to use the new table</p>   <p>Let’s test the endpoint and compare with the old one</p>  <p>Both are really fast but the last one is one order of magnitude faster.</p> <p>You could create MV for any case you can think of, for example:</p> <ul> <li>unique ip addreeses by day: <code>select toDate(time) day, uniqState(ip_address) uniq_ip from log_transform group by day</code></li> <li>percentile 95 of payload size per hour: <code>select toStartOfHour(time) hour, quantileState(0.95)(ip_address) q95 from log_transform group by hour</code></li> <li>requests per month: <code>select toStartOfMonth(time) month, countState() requests_count from log_transform group by month</code></li> </ul> <p>Materialized views are a really powerful feature specially when you are creating real time endpoints.</p> <p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">github repo</a> with the data project so you can reproduce the post commands in your Tinybird account and start analysing your own logs.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

        <p><em>Most of the time, a backend is just a layer between APIs and a database. Using the Postgrest project and
                some SQL we will build a backend without any Java, Golang, C# etc…</em></p>
        <p><em>For this Demo, we will build a chat application with channels, messages, users and user profiles.</em>
        </p>
        <p><code>March 02,2020</code></p>
        <h2 id="firstadatabase">First, a database</h2>
        <p>Database, an essential tool for every project on the web. Relationnal databases are not new… almost 50 years
            !
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database</a>
        </p>
        <p>With stored procedures, views, user management, roles and a query langage we all know we can do whatever we
            want on our data. With frameworks, ORM and other tools that makes great integration between Object langages
            and Relational Databases we spend most of time using them to access data in a simple way, so simple that we
            can do directly with SQL.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a> is a very popular open source database
            system, so let's go with it.</p>
        <p>Now our docker-compose file starts with : </p>
        <pre><code>version: '3'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
            ports:
              - "5432:5432"
            environment:
              POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        </code></pre>
        <h2 id="anauthenticationserverkeycloakwithpleaseopenit">An authentication server : keycloak with please-open.it
        </h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://console.please-open.it/">https://console.please-open.it</a> and subscribe to a free
            keycloak realm. It is the easiest way to start.</p>
        <p>This realm will provide JWT tokens we need to authenticate users on our DB. JWT tokens are signed with a
            private key. We need to retreive a public key in order to verify token signature.
            Go to "realm settings", "keys", and get the public key for RSA RS256 algorithm.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/public_key.png" alt="public_key"></p>
        <p>This key is in PEM format. For postgrest, we need it in JWK.
            A simple tool online can do it for you : <a href="https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp">https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp</a></p>
        <p>Add "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" delimiters, paste your key and transform it
            to JWK.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/pem_to_jwk.png" alt="pem to jwk"></p>
        <h3 id="createaclient">Create a client</h3>
        <p>A client for a web frontend is needed, to get an access<em>token after login. Go to "clients" and create a
                new one. This client in this example is named "frontend". Choose access type "public", and define the
                redirect</em>uri to "https://playground.please-open.it/" for now.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/new_client.png" alt="new client"></p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>Go to "roles" tab in the client, we need only 2 roles : standard and admin. Create them, after we will
            associate to users.
            <img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/roles.png" alt="roles"></p>
        <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
        <p>2 users "standard" and 1 "admin". </p>
        <p>After creating a user, remove all "required user actions", go to "credentials" and attribute a new password.
            In "Role Mappings", select your client "frontend" and add a "standard", or "admin" role.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/role_mapping.png" alt="add roles"></p>
        <h3 id="webapplication">Web application</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to obtain a token, is your (playground)[https://playground.please-open.it]. An opensource web
            application, oauth2 client for keycloak and token introspection.
            In "parameters", put your realm id and client id. Now we are ready to retreive a new token. Click on
            "login", enter a user credentials and the redirect will do the job.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/login.png" alt="login"></p>
        <p>An access_token is retreived and decoded. The base64 encoded will be used later, in each api call.</p>
        <h2 id="restapispostgrest">REST APIs : postgrest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational<em>state</em>transfer</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/">Postgrest</a> is a standalone app with a web server, turning a
            database directly into a RESTful API. Sometimes the only way we are using ORM for.</p>
        <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is ensured by JWT tokens. Postgrest verifies the signature with the given key (using
            "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable), then get a role in the token's payload.</p>

        <p>An anonymous role gives access to data without any authentication. We gives to postgrest a name of an
            anonymous role. By using this, all resources granted to this role will be accessible without a token.</p>

        <p>Go to <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/</a> and open "Live

        <p>Only select is permitted on web_anon.</p>
        <p>Now we register a new role "standard" which corresponds to the role we created previously in keycloak.
            With the configuration, postgrest will check in JWT token at resource<em>access.frontend.roles[0] value is

        <p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24965293">ranted on HN </a>the other day about Google Meet's user interface gore.</p><blockquote>Aside: Imagine you’re driving down the road and you need to make a right turn. Well, for some reason the steering wheel is stowed away and disappeared! You need to hover your hand around the center console in a specific area to be able to expose it. Out comes the steering wheel and now you can make a right turn.<p>Google UX/UI team: Please fucking make the mute/unmute button visible at all times.</p></blockquote><p>Seems like someone at Google read the comment and the bottom bar is now always visible. It used to autohide after 3 seconds and it was one of the most infuriating things about Google Meet.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png" alt="Google Meet UI Screenshot showing the bottom bar with Mute/Unmute button always visible." srcset="https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1000w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bottom bar with the Mute button is always visible now.</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing if you're muted or unmuted is probably the number 1 most important interface element of any A/V conference application. What's more surprising is that are other icons on the top-right corner that are always visible. So, someone at Google UX/UI team thought that the mute button is less important and the whole bottom bar must autohide to clear the clutter. Ooofff.

We've just seen exactly that.</p><blockquote>Isn't this sort of a Fizz Buzz for a UX/UI design professional? I don't mean to demean anyone, but I see this sort of a thing literally everywhere. Hiding important and absolutely <em>crucial</em> information (that can make or break your product) in the name of minimalism. Coming out of a company that has one of the highest hiring bars for software engineering, and yet, their products have such an awful UX/UI. This isn't an exception, it is a pattern.</blockquote><p>What do you know!? The exact shitty Google Meet pattern is repeated by UX/UI team at Microsoft! It's as if they're copying UX/UI without thinking for themselves.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/teams.gif" alt="Video showing Microsoft Teams webapp autohiding Mute/Unmute controls"><figcaption>Microsoft Teams - Autohiding the most important controls.</figcaption></figure><p>After a few seconds, the control bar disappears, but the left-hand side panel is always visible.

From the ground up, from fundamentals, from axioms of human behavior, from analytical standpoint, with experimental insights, and then a mandatory - "Aesthetics is secondary" course. If your knee-jerk reaction to what I just said is "But, Aesthetics sells." - yes it does, if you're selling trinkets and wind-catchers at a tourist shop. Not for business critical applications.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>UX/UI professionals need to study deeply how humans and machines interact. I remember referencing the classic High Performance HMI book many years ago in engineering college. Obviously nuclear powerplant operators and their interface needs are not exactly the same as a corporate manager trying to make a funny joke out of "Oh, I was on mute.", but I think there is some value in atleast understanding the methodologies and formalisms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">Engineering rigor and systems engineering</a> approach can be applied to many other fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each. For a modern and user-friendly example of bypassing ReCAPTCHA, see Buster. <a href="https://github.com/dessant/buster">Buster</a> is a modern browser extension (Firefox+Chrome+Opera) which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges for you by using speech recognition.</p>











<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many
Internet protocols, and you will encounter it quickly after enabling
HTTP, SSH, or …</p></div></div>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have stumbled upon this page after visiting <a href="https://privanote.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrivaNote (privanote.xyz)</a>.</p><p>PrivaNote is an offline first, end-to-end encrypted note taking solution. It's one of the first applications built on top of Portabella and serves as a reference for other developers looking to build their own apps.</p><p>PrivaNote is <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> so please take a look at the source code if anything is unclear. We've also released a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/privanote-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox addon</a> to help you take notes as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>With that said, let's dive into how we built this!</p><h3>Overview<a href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PrivaNote is a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailwindCSS</a> to make it look pretty. The editor is a reasonably customised <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> instance. Setting up these components to play nicely is a breeze thanks to modern tooling.</p><p>Without setting up the encrypted backup PrivaNote will write to your browsers IndexedDB or LocalStorage. After setting up and initialising your Portabella configuration it will read and write from there.</p><h3>Scaffolding out application<a href="#scaffolding-out-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our initialisation script looked a little like this:</p><p>We took a lot of inspiration for our editor from one of the examples the <a href="https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate-plugins</a> library provides.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to IndexedDB<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-indexeddb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After scaffolding our application we needed to ensure it's offline first. That means we should be able to use it without an internet connection and without Portabella. For this we leveraged the <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localForage</a> library. It tries to use IndexedDB and then falls back to LocalStorage if the browser doesn't have it.</p><p>We could have written this layer ourselves but it just made sense to bring in a dependency to make sure we didn't mess anything up.</p><p>To read all of our notes it looks a bit like this:</p><p>Creating a note is as easy as:</p><p>We won't show you the delete operation because, well, you get the gist.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to Portabella<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-portabella" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Setting up our Portabella integration is a little trickier. We have a few additional constraints here, we need to:</p><ul><li>save Portabella config in our local database</li><li>check if they have Portabella config before falling back to the local database storage</li><li>prompt users to setup their Portabella integration (after 10 seconds to not be annoying).</li></ul><p>Let's cover reading and writing data before we get to the administrative tasks. Writing a note to Portabella leveraging the <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabella/sdk</a> is as easy as:</p><p>Reading all our notes (when we refresh the page for example looks like):</p><p>The SDK takes care of decrypting everything for us so we don't need to worry about getting data we can't read.</p><h3>Prompting for Portabella credentials<a href="#prompting-for-portabella-credentials" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Before we can do the above operations we need to ensure we actually have Portabella config so we can initialise the SDK and make requests.</p><p>To do this we want to prompt the user to setup their integration after 10 seconds on PrivaNote. Additionally we don't want to prompt them again if they've already said yes (or no).</p><p>Our React <code>useEffect</code> hook looks a bit like this:</p><p>Doing it this way allows for a seamless end user experience.</p><h3>Packaging it as a browser extension<a href="#packaging-it-as-a-browser-extension" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The final piece of the puzzle is packaging up the Next.js application for use as a browser extension. Having to manually open privanote.xyz everytime you want to take notes is a bit cumbersome, so the idea is to override the "new tab" page of your browser. That means pressing CMD (or CTRL) + N will open up PrivaNote, allowing you to jott down thoughts without thinking twice about it.</p><p>Here's our script we used to do this:</p><p>The most interesting lines are the ones that contain <code>_next</code> and <code>next</code>. Chrome won't let browser extensions import JavaScript files that start with an underscore. So trying to add a <code>&lt;script src="/_next/a.js" /&gt;</code> tag won't work out of the box, we need to replace <code>_next</code> with <code>next</code> (or any string you prefer). The <code>sed</code> command shown here works on Mac OS but you might have to fiddle with it if you're using a different OS.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks for taking the time to checkout this tutorial, as we said PrivaNote is one of the first applications built on top of Portabella so we'll continue to improve documentation and APIs as we go and discover what's useful to people.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to reach on Twitter to us <a href="https://twitter.com/portabellaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabellaio</a> or via email <a href="mailto:hello@portabella.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@portabella.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install colorama <span>0.4</span>.4 successful
  ✔ Install packaging <span>20.8</span> successful
  ✔ Install more-itertools <span>5.0</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install pyparsing <span>2.4</span>.7 successful
  ✔ Install attrs <span>20.3</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install pluggy <span>0.13</span>.1 successful
  ✔ Install py <span>1.10</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

Since its introduction in 2014, Kubernetes has revolutionized modern application building towards containers and microservices.</p><p>It has automated the previously manual task of deploying and managing containerized applications, allowing easier scalability and simplifying the manual management required of infra teams.</p><p>As a result, Kubernetes is the go-to platform for companies scaling their applications and engineering teams.</p><p>The increased engineering efficiency and stability provided by the extensive Kubernetes platform also comes with increased complexity.</p><p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, over half of companies deploying applications on the Kubernetes platform have over 250 deployed microservices. In addition, according to a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">report</a> polling 950 IT leaders, over 56% of companies planned to expand their use of microservices and deployments on Kubernetes in the next 12 months.</p><p>From these numbers, it's clear that most companies using Kubernetes either already have a staggering amount of microservices or are quickly on their way there. As companies begin to scale with Kubernetes, new problems of service overload arise. With so many Kubernetes deployments, service visibility is naturally obscured and difficult to avoid.</p><p>When you're running 50 or 500 services, it's much harder to keep track of service owners, oncall information, and other important information for each service than when you're running 5 services.</p><p>That's where Cortex comes in. With the new Cortex Kubernetes integration, you can quickly and easily map and keep track of your services and their owners, so whether you're running 5 or 500 services, you know what's happening with each. You can augment each k8s service with critical pieces of context like ownership (linked to your identity provider), documentation, on-call info, latency graphs, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-462784fda960-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b30f41fbfce2f0104b295_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_12.55.09_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>While this may seem like a problem only applicable to large companies with those 500 services, it's never too soon to start cataloging and organizing your services. If your company has recently adopted or is considering adopting Kubernetes, chances are you're either already experiencing rapid growth of services and engineering or you anticipate it coming soon.</p><p>With Cortex, you can easily start mapping your Kubernetes services. Cortex grows with you as your cluster grows, making sure new services play well with the old ones and old ones don't get lost along the way. Your existing services get automatically mapped to the Kubernetes deployments, so getting started is extremely simple!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b311a63ba4e69a5b356bd_Screen_Shot_2020-12-14_at_4.04.14_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So what happens if all your services have already gotten lost along the way and you already have those 500 services? If you have an established cluster and many services, the new Cortex Kubernetes integration helps you un-clutter in the click of a button.</p><p>Cortex automatically detects all your Kubernetes deployments and allows you to easily import all of them in a single click. You can quickly see your services, map them to owners, and start making sense of the clutter. The best part is, as your cluster inevitably grows even more, Cortex will continue to detect all your new Kubernetes services and map them automatically.</p><p>In addition to easily importing all your Kubernetes services to Cortex, you'll also soon be able to see important Kubernetes information for each service such as replica count, restarts, status, etc. directly from your catalog. Want to also see which k8s services are not conforming to standards on your team? You can use scorecards to score and monitor each service in your cluster for deployment health and readiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b3138bb1299f5719162ee_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_1.19.02_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Each k8s service can be graded on rules you define in a scorecard</figcaption></figure><p>Sign up for a demo <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and we'll send you a helm chart to try it out in your own cluster!</p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>Back in 2013 exactly 1 year after the first Raspberry Pi was sold RS components – One of two licenced Raspberry Pi Manufacturers at the time released a limited production run of 1000 blue Raspberry Pis. </p><p>They came with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Eben Upton and a matching Blue case from One Nine Design in Wales.   </p></div>

<div><p>There was a pretty big catch though. They were never available to purchase. So how did you get one? </p><p>The majority of them were donated to charities involving kids educations and some were given away as competition prizes. Although it seems like a few slipped through the net!</p></div>



<div><p>I managed to get my hands on one and there are several available on eBay. I spoke to the eBay seller and he claims his Friend that used to work for RS Components gave him them. </p><p>Lets take a look at mine.</p></div>

<p>The first thing you come across as the box is opened – the Certificate of Authenticity. Each Blue Pi has a number, mine is #80. </p>

<p>Carefully opening the boxed Pi and managing to not destroy the holographic security seals I found the Blue Pi in all its glory. Also included is a quick start guide and the Regulatory information. <br></p>

<p>Other than the Colour the Blue Pi is identical to a Rev 2 Model B as can be seen above – The only other difference is that the Ethernet port is covered with a holographic RS Components logo. <br></p>

<p>It turns out the Rev 2 Model B doesn’t only come in Blue and Green. Egoman (A Chinese electronic device manufacturer) were licenced to produce a Model B for the Chinese Market with a Red PCB to make the device easy to distinguish. The reason for this was simple, the boards are missing the FCC/CE markings making it illegal to import them into the EU or USA. It seems that very few did make it into the UK although they are around, a popular Crypto mining ASIC used the Red Pi as a controller board. If anyone has one for sale I would be very interested in purchasing one to complete my collection! </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The Blue Pi is a cool device however its nothing more than a collectors item at this point. I haven’t even attempted to power this one on although I fully expect it will work!</p>



<p>More information can be found in the original press release <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/blue-pi/">here</a>. </p>



<p>There are also a few for sale on eBay <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/early-raspberry-Pi-Blue-Case-Collectors-Rare-Limited-Edition/333871943231?hash=item4dbc518e3f:g:qAcAAOSwtD5gExmD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> but be quick! They end tomorrow.  </p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I avoided touching SVGs when working with front-end code. Iâ€™d have no trouble with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but SVGs always intimidated me with their bizarre syntax and those weird, indecipherable strings of letters and numbers. You know the ones:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;path</span> <span>d=</span><span>"M 4 4 h 16 a 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 v 14"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I needed icons for a project, Iâ€™d install one of the many icon libraries that are available, but that always left me unsatisfied. Sure, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using libraries, but itâ€™s always a good idea to know how the tools you use really work under the hood. So why not also learn how to draw your own SVG icons by hand, even if you end up using a library in the end?</p>

<p>As youâ€™ll see in this tutorial, coding SVG icons by hand is actually fairly straightforward once you master the basic shapes and syntax. Weâ€™ll draw a bunch of icons to help you hone your SVG skills. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at all of the icons weâ€™ll create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="32" height="32">

      <line x1="12" y1="14" x2="20" y2="6"></line>
      <polyline points="16 5.5, 20 5.5, 20 9.5"></polyline>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, I took inspiration for these SVG icons from <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a>, a fantastic library created by <a href="https://colebemis.com/">Cole Bemis</a>. These icons will help us learn how to draw the following shapes with SVG:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lines</li>
  <li>Polylines</li>
  <li>Circles</li>
  <li>Polygons</li>
  <li>Curved paths</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve learned the basics, you can draw almost anything with SVGs.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™re excited to get started! Feel free to jump around if you want, but Iâ€™ve structured this tutorial intentionally so that each section builds on new knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-svg">What Is an SVG?</h2>

<p><strong>SVG</strong> stands for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong>; itâ€™s a vector image format that allows you to draw shapes using a standard markup (XML) syntax. The â€œscalableâ€� part of the name is a key characteristic of SVGsâ€”unlike other image formats, they donâ€™t lose quality when you scale them beyond their original size. Whereas images store their data using fixed-size pixels, SVGs store them as XML definitions for shapes, which can easily be scaled responsively to any size.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that you can animate SVGs; <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/">Joshua Comeau</a> uses this to great effect on his site, creating a delightful and interactive user experience.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-svgs-drawn">How Are SVGs Drawn?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to draw SVGs: by hand, where you define the markup explicitly using HTML, or through a <strong>vector image program</strong> like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png" alt="Inkscape's user interface consists of drawing tools on the left-hand side, page alignment and setup options on the right, and a canvas in the center." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>These programs come with basic shapes, color pickers, drawing tools, and path manipulation, allowing you to create complex drawings with greater ease than if you were to do them by hand. Youâ€™ll typically see designers and logo artists using GUIs like Inkscape rather than coding SVGs by hand. Still, understanding how SVG markup works is a valuable learning experience. At the end of the day, these programs output <code>.svg</code> files; if you inspect those files, youâ€™ll find that their markup is just XML, and you can make sense of it if you understand how SVGs work.</p>

<h2 id="svg-101-how-to-code-svgs-by-hand">SVG 101: How to Code SVGs by Hand</h2>

<p>I know youâ€™re itching to get to the examples, but first things first!</p>

<p>All SVG shapes are defined within the SVG element itself, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- stuff goes here --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, thereâ€™s more to it than just that. Letâ€™s explore the basic anatomy of an SVG.</p>

<h3 id="svg-namespace-declarations">SVG Namespace Declarations</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve ever inspected the contents of an <code>.svg</code> file, like one created by Inkscape or some other vector image program, you may have seen this <code>xmlns</code> attribute on the <code>svg</code> element itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is known as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course#declaring_namespaces">namespace declaration</a>. In simple terms, a namespace declaration helps a user agent like your browser to understand and parse an elementâ€™s syntax. Here, weâ€™ve declared that our namespace is SVG. A namespace declaration is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18468348/5323344">not required if youâ€™re rendering inline SVG icons</a>, like in HTML. But if youâ€™re including SVG <em>files</em> (e.g., as an image), then the SVG does need to specify its namespace. Iâ€™ll omit the namespace in this tutorial since we donâ€™t need one.</p>

<h3 id="svg-viewbox-and-size">SVG <code>viewBox</code> and Size</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ve probably also seen these three attributes: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>viewBox</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span>
  <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span>
  <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span>
  <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, the <code>viewBox</code> attribute defines <strong>the dimensions of the viewport (â€œcanvasâ€�) for our SVG</strong>. The first two numbers allow us to pan the SVG viewport horizontally or vertically, giving it an appearance of some sort of inner offset relative to the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. Here, we have an offset of <code>0 0</code>, meaning the top-left corner of the viewport <em>is</em> the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. The last two numbers control the base size of the viewport, before the SVG is scaled. Larger numbers lead to a larger viewport and more space to work with, while smaller numbers lead to a smaller viewport and less space to work with. Here, the viewport size is declared to be <code>24x24</code>, so our coordinates range from <code>(0, 0)</code> (top-left) to <code>(24, 24)</code> (bottom-right):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png" alt="An SVG's coordinate system has an origin of (0, 0) at the top-left corner. For an SVG whose viewBox is 0 0 24 24, the bottom-right corner is at (24, 24)." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>The other two attributes, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, work just as youâ€™d expect: They define the width and height of your SVG element, in pixels. You can also change an SVGâ€™s size with CSS using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, so while the SVG above has a starting width and height of <code>24px</code>, it doesnâ€™t <em>always</em> have to be that size. Thatâ€™s the whole point of SVG, after allâ€”they can scale to <em>any</em> size!</p>

<p>Moreover, note that the the width and height of an SVG donâ€™t need to match the <code>viewBox</code>â€™s size. In fact, the coordinates of all SVG shapes that we draw are relative to the <code>viewBox</code>, not to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the SVG.</p>

<p>For example, if our <code>viewBox</code> is <code>0 0 24 24</code> but weâ€™ve set the width and height to be <code>32</code>, or some other number, then weâ€™re still working within a base viewport size of <code>24x24</code>, so thereâ€™s no visible point like <code>(25, 25)</code>. Everything will just get scaled up by a factor of <code>1.3</code> to give us a bigger SVG drawing. This is really useful because it means we can draw all of our icons using a fixed viewport size, and if we later want to scale it up, we donâ€™t have to adjust the shapes and their coordinatesâ€”the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> will scale everything for us.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, Iâ€™ll use a <code>viewBox</code> of <code>0 0 24 24</code>, but dimensions of <code>64x64</code> so theyâ€™re easier to see. You can use any values that you want, though, so long as you adjust your markup accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="svgs-and-pixels">SVGs and â€œPixelsâ€�</h3>

<p>Before we move on, a clarifying note on pixels and SVGs: With the most basic SVG, one pixel unit maps to exactly one unit on your screen. But as noted on the MDN docs, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions#what_are_pixels">this isnâ€™t always the case</a>. SVGs are scalable, after all, so <code>1px</code> in the SVG definition may actually map to <code>4px</code> if the SVG has been scaled to a larger size with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. This is unlike the behavior of images, where one â€œpixelâ€� is always a fixed-size unit of measurement. Key takeaway: Wherever I use <code>px</code> as a unit, donâ€™t take that to mean one literal output pixel on the userâ€™s screen.</p>

<h2 id="creating-basic-shapes-with-svg">Creating Basic Shapes with SVG</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to draw SVG icons by hand is to work with basic shapes. To get started, weâ€™ll draw some icons using lines. This will get us familiar with some of the basics of SVG before we dive into more advanced shapes.</p>

<h3 id="1-lines">1. Lines</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll practice our line-drawing skills by recreating the three icons below. Youâ€™ll find these in lots of text editors that offer text alignment options, so while this exercise may seem trivial, itâ€™s actually very practical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="9.4" x2="16" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="19.8" x2="16" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="9.4" x2="18" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="19.8" x2="18" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="9.4" x2="22" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="19.8" x2="22" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, these all consist of just four horizontal lines.</p>

<p>To draw a line in SVG, we need two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A starting point: <code>(x1, y1)</code>.</li>
  <li>An ending point: <code>(x2, y2)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, an SVGâ€™s coordinate system starts with <code>(0, 0)</code> at the top-left corner. The <code>x</code>-values increase as you move to the right, and the <code>y</code>-values increase as you move down.</p>

<p>SVGs allow us to specify the starting and ending points for lines using four attributes: <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>y2</code>. So, to draw a simple horizontal line, we could do the following:</p>


<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"64"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"64"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;line</span> <span>x1=</span><span>"0"</span> <span>y1=</span><span>"4.2"</span> <span>x2=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>y2=</span><span>"4.2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can think of this as telling the browser to put an imaginary pen down at <code>(0px, 4.2px)</code> and move it right until it reaches <code>(24px, 4.2px)</code>.</p>

<p>If you use this markup on your end, you wonâ€™t see anything just yet. Thatâ€™s because we havenâ€™t told the browser what color to use for the line! There are two ways we can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> attribute on the SVG element or any of its individual shapes.</li>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> property via CSS, on the SVG element or any of its shapes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both will do the same thing, but I prefer the CSS approach since it means writing less code. You can either pass in a hard-coded color, like a hex value, or use the magic <code>currentColor</code> value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>svg</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>stroke</span><span>:</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In CSS, <code>currentColor</code> always references the current text <code>color</code>, which is either the color inherited from the parent or whatever color youâ€™ve explicitly defined for that element. I prefer <code>currentColor</code> for SVGs, as it makes it easy for me to insert my icons anywhere I want, and theyâ€™ll inherit the surrounding text color. Moreover, if that text color is set using CSS custom properties, <code>currentColor</code> will change whenever the custom property changes! This is useful for styling SVG icons in apps that have both a light and a dark mode (like this …</p></div></article></div></div>

The sensor is in the small window near the “SpotON” port.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=hs0FdiTHMbc">Video explanation</a> of the principal of operation.</p></div>
<p>About a year ago, my girlfriend says, “I think we can sequence DNA in our extra room.” She showed me the website of Oxford Nanopore, which makes a USB DNA sequencer. We joked about it for a bit and that was that.</p>
<p>Until October, when I decided to buy her one for Christmas. I punched my credit card into their nice online store and waited for my shipping confirmation, which never arrived. Finally, I emailed them and found out I needed to join their “community.” At this point, I should mention that I’m not a biologist and I’m certainly not qualified to join a community of researchers. And they wanted to have a phone call. And this thing had better arrive by Dec. 25.</p>
<p>So I fessed up to my girlfriend (who has a PhD in genetics) and she wrote me a notecard with exactly what to say. I studied up. The day comes and I’m all nervous. The rep, I’ll call her Alice, phones and I proudly explain all the things I’m going to do, straight off my notecard.</p>
<p>Then Alice starts asking questions. I was not prepared for questions. Do I have a temperature controlled fridge? Duh, of course (in the kitchen)<span id="easy-footnote-1-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-233" title="it wasn&amp;#8217;t and we soon acquired a new fridge"><sup>1</sup></a></span> A freezer? Yes obviously<span id="easy-footnote-2-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-233" title="yeah we bought a new one of those too"><sup>2</sup></a></span>. A centrifuge and thermocycler? “Uh sure yeah I have that<span id="easy-footnote-3-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-233" title="hope that thing I just claimed to own isn&amp;#8217;t too expensive"><sup>3</sup></a></span>.” Then Alice started asking questions about my research. Uh oh. I repeat something about bacterial colonies from my card but she isn’t buying it. I manage to get out that I understand this isn’t a spit-in-the-tube-and-done thing and that’s all I’ve got. She keeps pushing and I eventually admit that I’m really buying it for my girlfriend for Christmas. Apparently that’s okay, since once Alice finishes laughing she said that it will arrive by Dec. 25 but they don’t offer a gift-wrap service.</p>
<p>The box arrives, packed in some sweet dry ice stuff. Dec. 25 comes and I get a set of pipettes and a PCR machine.</p>
<p>The obvious thing to sequence is one of us but the MinION can only do 1-2 billion bases per run<span id="easy-footnote-4-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-233" title="in our hands; Oxford Nanopore <a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion&quot;>claims 10-20 Gb now</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>; to have decent quality for a human you need more like 90 billion <span id="easy-footnote-5-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-233" title="there&amp;#8217;s a lot of variables here, go read this: <a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060&quot;>Nanopore sequencing and assembly of a human genome with ultra-long reads</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span>. We decide to swab our mouths before brushing our teeth and find out what’s in there. My girlfriend whips up some media, we plop our swabs in, and put the tubes in the $30 chicken egg incubator she found on Amazon. Two days later I’m informed that the cultures smell like “really really bad breath,” and that I “really ought to smell them for myself,” which I studiously avoid for the next two months.</p>
<p>With the help of a <a href="https://greenbioresearch.com/product/genomic-dna-isolation-extraction-purification-kit-for-blood-bacteria-cell-tissue-samples/">$80 genomic DNA extraction kit</a>, we cut up the cells, filter all their bits out, and have genomic DNA ready to go. First we run a gel electrophoresis to prove to ourselves that we didn’t mess up the extraction too much.</p>
<p>At this step, all the real biologists out there are assuming I’m going to talk about quantifying the DNA to make sure we had the right concentration before blowing a $500 flow-cell (the consumable part of the MinION) on this. Yeah, that would be a lot of work and the line is pretty bright in the gel…</p>
<p>We open the fridge to get out the sequencer’s flow-cell and notice that everything is frozen. Oh %$@*#@#*. I set the fridge to “10” because that seemed like a good idea. Alice definitely isn’t going to buy my warranty-return story. Two days later we’ve got a new thermometer and are praying that 100 freeze-thaw cycles are, uh, totally fine.</p>
<p>Happily the MinION comes with a calibration program that doesn’t seem to notice our substandard storage: all green. At this point we discover that Oxford Nanopore helpfully sends everyone a set of sample DNA to run first. We decide that sounds like a really good idea.</p>
<p>The promotional videos for the MinION claim, “simple 10 minute setup.” About two hours later, we’ve done the library prep, and we’re pipetting into the device. There are lots of warnings on their webpage about how you really can’t let air into the thing (permanent destruction of the flow-cell, blah blah). So of course the first thing we do is introduce an air bubble. But it only covers half the sensor. I think it’s the most expensive 5µL of air I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It turns out the sequencer produces so much data the minimum requirements are a 1TB SSD and a quad-core CPU. My girlfriend’s laptop has 200 GB and a dual core, so that will have to suffice. We fire it up and it starts producing reads. We’re over the moon. 6-hours later the run finishes, but only 10% of the bases have been “called.” The way the system works is by reading tiny changes in electric current as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Apparently the signal processing is kind of hard because 2 days later it’s still going. I play Overwatch by myself.</p>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="99%" height="150"><source src="https://i.imgur.com/Mlg4V3f.mp4"></video><br>
<em>Sequencing. You can see the 512 ports on the laptop screen. Approximately half are green (sequencing or waiting for DNA) and the other half are blue (air-bubbled).</em></p>
<p>The Oxford Nanopore website supports automated uploading and analysis of some datasets, including the calibration run. <a href="http://www.abarry.org/likelytobeforgotten/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Selection_120.png">Our run</a> produced 983 million (aligned) base pairs, which any professionals reading this are scoffing at, but I’m pretty sure Celera circa 2000 would have been impressed. I certainly am. The last time I did anything close to this, we tested PTC tasting with a gel electrophoresis that took all day and effectively sequenced 1 base. We prep and load our mouth-bacteria genomic DNA into the sequencer. We’re reusing the flow-cell to save money and it’s hard to load correctly. We’re all paranoid about air bubbles now, but there’s a ton of them in the little fluid pipes. Eventually we look at each other, shrug, and put the sample in. It goes nowhere.</p>
<p>The library prep includes adding “loading beads” to the sample which give the liquid a ghostly white color. You can see if your sample is on the sensor by tracking the movement of that color, and ours clearly was stuck on the top of the port. Eventually we searched the forums and found someone else incompetent enough to have the same problem, with a solution that can be summarized as, “pull some liquid out of a different port and hope.” It worked great.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

              </p> <p>Back at the Indian Institute of Science, Vijay set about confirming his hunch in the lab of his mentor, evolutionary ecologist Kartik Shanker. In addition to recording the calls of the lichen-backed frog and taking its photographs, he had euthanised a couple of individuals.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">

           Studying their genetic material, or DNA, would tell him what he needed to know. Preparing DNA samples for analysis is delicate lab work. Vijay

           started by placing pieces of the frog’s thigh muscles in a sterilised plastic tube smaller than the size of a little finger. But muscle cells also contain other components, such as proteins, which come in the way of isolating DNA. A cocktail of chemicals is used to break open the muscle cells, dissolve the proteins and separate the DNA for purification.</p></div><p>Another chemical dunk helped isolate the three specific genes Vijay was after. His team made millions of copies of the gene fragments. A few drops of clear liquid—all there was to show after this intricate work—were then sent to a gene lab for sequencing.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>
                S
              </p> <p>o what is a species? In the seventeenth century, European thinkers proposed that a group of organisms that could breed with each other could be called a species. A century on, Carl Linnaeus, the pioneering Swedish naturalist, popularised the use of combining two Latin terms: first the name of the genus,
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="u7ivdfqvucs5">[8]</sup>
            </a>
           then that of the species. The yellow-eyed bush frog has the name <em>Raorchestes </em>because it signifies the genus <em>Raorchestes</em>, which encompasses almost 65 species of bush frogs mostly from South Asia; <em>flaviocularis</em>&nbsp;is its species.</p></div><p>For all this time, scientists have been having furious arguments about the best way to classify species. There are presently more than 30 approaches to define a species, variously based in ancestry, ecology, appearances, even sound. The general consensus these days is to take an “integrative” approach. So Vijay started off with <em>flaviocularis</em>’s distinct looks––its morphology––and then worked on tracing its family tree in the DNA lab. The distinctiveness of its metallic calls, as well as its geographical distribution, helped along the hypothesis that <em>flaviocularis</em> was a species that hadn’t been described previously.</p><p>“Documenting the existence of a species is the first step to understanding our biodiversity,” Shanker said. It’s an exciting field because there is so much we don’t know. Ecologists have terms of art associated with these knowledge gaps. The Linnean Shortfall refers to the problem of undescribed lineages. A Wallacean Shortfall
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="wszrks8kngx3">[9]</sup>
            </a>
           refers to the lack of information about a species’ geographical distribution. “These shortfalls are the starting point for our exploration of ecology and evolution. There are lots of questions that can be answered once both these knowledge gaps are addressed,” said Shanker.</p><p>One set of questions is evolutionary in nature: Where did a species originate? If it started from Africa, how did it find its way into Asia and diversify? That’s how we got Asian elephants for instance: fossil remains indicate that the first elephant ancestors originated in Africa during the geological epoch known as the Early Pliocene.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="hfc0ff8tqwol">[10]</sup>
            </a>
           Recent genetic and fossil studies now confirm that their descendants moved into Asia 2-4 million years ago, and gave rise to the modern Asian elephant just 2.5 lakh years ago.</p><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>Geographic barriers such as deep gorges and wide rivers also affect dispersal, and can isolate populations. The gaps and valleys of the Western Ghats explain why there are so many different kinds of bush frogs. A species’ own ability to move around determines the kind of places it eventually gets to: birds are likelier than frogs to move from one mountain to another, for example.</p><p>Then they could ask after ecological factors such as rainfall, temperature and altitude, gradients along which species can adapt and evolve into different groups. </p></div><p>Finally, there are questions related to conservation. Research may focus on the availability of a type of plant if it appears that a species relies on it for survival. This data is analysed to help us approach answers to speculative questions like: what could happen to the species a hundred years from now; how would they adapt to climate change? </p><p>One of the things that is clear after a couple of centuries of study is that the species richness of a region increases as you move from the poles to the tropics. Within the tropics, you get “biodiversity hotspots.”

           These are sites that represent only 2.4% of the earth’s land surface, support more than 40% of endemic fauna, and are threatened by human habitation.</p><p>The Himalayas, with an estimated 10,000 species of plants including more than 3,100 endemics, is one of them. The states of north-eastern India that form part of the larger Indo-Burma hotspot are another. But easily the most well-studied hotspot in India is the Western Ghats.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Two</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>
                T
              </p> <p>he Western Ghats stretch almost parallel to India’s west coast. They variously constitute about 1600kms of sparse and dense forests, blue mountains, steep cliffs, thorny bushes, flat plateaus, leech-ridden swamps and windy grasslands. At one end, they start as shrub-bearing hillocks about 10km north of India’s southernmost tip. Then, they become the Ashambu Hills, mighty granite mountains forming a natural border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in the shadow of which lie spice gardens and homesteads.</p></div><p>Then comes the Shencottah Gap. After those 7km, the Ghats rise again to form the Meghamalai Hills, home of <em>flaviocularis</em>, the yellow-eyed bush frog. These are followed by a small plateau which leads to the hills of Palani and Anamalai. Cardamom, coffee and tea plantations blanket the slopes here. Look up, and mist permitting, you can see some of the tallest peaks in the south—“sky islands,” hosting ecosystems wildly different from those of the surrounding lowlands. In the shallow valleys of these highlands, naturally stunted forests known as the “sholas” occur alongside open grassland patches. </p><p>North of the Anamalais come the Nilgiris. But first, there’s a deep valley. At 32km wide, 100m above sea level, the Palghat Gap is the widest and lowest pass in the Ghats. A dusty national highway cuts right through it, connecting Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala.</p><p>Beyond, the Ghats stretch into north Kerala and Karnataka, its high peaks separated occasionally by shallow valleys. They almost kiss the Arabian Sea before swerving east into Goa. By the time they taper off amidst the sugarcane fields of Maharashtra, they are less imposing and more climbable, now ambling along until they reach their other end in the deciduous forest tracts of south Gujarat.&nbsp; </p><p>The remarkable contiguity broken by wide gaps and valleys, the sheer range of landscapes, the distance covered: all this should indicate why the Ghats are a species discovery hotspot. They comprise less than 6% of India’s land area but are home to more than 30% of all plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species found in the country. Of the 406 known frog and toad species in India, more than 200 are endemic to the Ghats. Over a hundred of these endemics have been discovered only in the last 20 years. </p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Three</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>
                D
              </p> <p>NA-based techniques have transformed new species research across the world. Uma Ramakrishnan, a conservation geneticist and professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences who led the genetic component of the research on sholakilis and chilappans, told me that India was still heavily reliant on morphological methods and distribution information till about a decade ago. Now there’s a whole suite of new technologies, including better computational and simulation programmes, that have popularised the use of genetic techniques to answer ecological questions. These technologies both advance and confirm the educated hunches researchers develop as they work.</p></div><p>There’s a flip side to this, too: taxonomic inflation, the over-categorisation of newly sighted animals. Some experts feel that researchers have begun claiming the tag of “new species” in cases where it is clearly unwarranted. Robin Kurian Abraham, a researcher at the University of Kansas, told me that the “overinflation” problem afflicts some Indian frog lineages too. Often, “new species” might just be sub-species, or different populations of the same species. “Why is it that we rarely hear of sub-species in frogs? There are even five extant sub-species of tigers across the world,” Abraham asked me.</p><p>The ‘species versus sub-species’ debate has been raging for years. Take the world of wolf taxonomy as an example. The grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus)</em> is found in most parts of the world. In 2018, a paper published in <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em> by a team of researchers led by Geraldine Werhahn created a splash. DNA analysis using scat and hair samples of the Himalayan wolf had revealed a genetic adaptation to cope with the lower oxygen levels of high altitudes.</p><p>It provided a massive shot in the arm to the theory that the Himalayan wolf is evolutionarily distinct: its lineage diverged before the radiation of the modern grey wolf. But the journey to species-hood is long and arduous. In February last year, Werhahn told <em>The Guardian</em> that researchers needed to obtain one final piece of higher-quality genomic data for the separate species case to succeed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN, the global organisation which evaluates and assesses conservation status. That quest is still on.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

But, when compared to optical approaches, radar resolution is challenging, especially at orbital altitude due to the large physical antenna sizes necessary for handling electromagnetic waves 4,000x longer than visible light. To improve resolution, <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/sar-101-an-introduction-to-synthetic-aperture-radar-2f0b6246c4a0" target="_blank">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) combines data from multiple radar pulses as a platform moves past a target, creating images with resolutions comparable to an infeasibly large <a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/radariii.html" target="_blank">real aperture radar</a>. (Another way to visualize SAR is that it works similarly to <a href="https://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html" target="_blank">phased-array antennas,</a> but multiplexes a single antenna in time relative to a stationary target vs multiple antennas in space relative to a moving target.) SAR, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar#History" target="_blank">first developed in the ‘50s</a> for military applications, has led to important scientific findings, such as the <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target="_blank">terrain imaging of Venus</a> and the detection of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (<a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/450/titanlakes.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>). Today’s SAR systems have increased resolution and decreased cost, leading to a boom in smallsat SAR data from multiple new providers, including <a href="https://www.ursaspace.com/" target="_blank">Ursa</a>, <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella</a>, <a href="https://www.iceye.com/" target="_blank">ICEYE</a>, <a href="https://i-qps.net/" target="_blank">iQPS</a>, <a href="https://www.predasar.com/" target="_blank">PredaSAR</a>, <a href="https://synspective.com/" target="_blank">Synspective</a>, and <a href="https://umbra.space/" target="_blank">Umbra</a> (who <a href="https://spacenews.com/umbra-raises-32-million/" target="_blank">just raised $32 million in additional funding</a>). Capella Space is one of the industry leaders with resolutions of 50cm x 50cm from a 10-meter antenna deployed from a ~40kg smallsat (two of these were on Transporter-1, see below). According to Capella's lead SAR scientist, this resolution would require a real aperture radar of 49 km (yes, <em>kilo</em>meters). SAR resolution along the orbital ground track (aka “azimuth” or “cross-range” resolution) is determined by radar pulse processing frequency—and therefore doesn't degrade with altitude, unlike optical and real aperture radar—, while the side looking "range" resolution is primarily determined by the radar's wavelength (many high-res SAR platforms use the ~3 cm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band" target="_blank">8–12 GHz X-band</a>, including Capella). SAR's drawbacks include vertical height distortion (called layover and foreshortening) and shadowing due to its side-looking orientation in relation to the craft's ground track (SAR cannot look straight down). SAR is also unable to accurately observe moving targets and can produce significant amounts of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference)" target="_blank">speckling</a>” and noise due to reflectance from rough surfaces and corners (a good <a href="https://youtu.be/u2bUKEi9It4" target="_blank">recent video overview</a> of SAR). But, its side-looking orientation enables its high range (or “cross-track”) resolution, and when paired with elevation maps it can be used to reconstruct 3D models of the observation area—an <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar" target="_blank">intro to SAR course from NASA</a>. Commercial applications of high-resolution SAR data have been speculated on (including your usual suspects of maritime tracking, crop monitoring, defense intelligence, and climate, with compelling all-weather natural disaster response added to the mix), but we don’t have many examples of real-world commercial use-cases just yet. Related: the <a href="https://asf.alaska.edu/#" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a> has a good repository of SAR data available if you’d like to experiment with some yourself.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/c4984c9b-9c36-45b2-aaea-f57a94b357f4.jpg" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td><p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" target="_blank">SAR image</a> of a floating Chinese solar farm including panels, apparently laid out to resemble a fish.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">¶</a><strong id="all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">All the missions on Transporter-1.</strong> So what was in the flotilla of 143 satellites launched on SpaceX’s Jan 24th Transporter-1 rideshare mission?

<p><strong>Pipenv</strong> is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. <em>Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.</em></p>
<p>It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code>, which is used to produce deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of <code><span>setup.py</span></code> vs <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> to define dependencies, see <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy"><span>☤ Pipfile vs setup.py</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"><img alt="a short animation of pipenv at work" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"></a></p><p>The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need to use <code><span>pip</span></code> and <code><span>virtualenv</span></code> separately. They work together.</li>
<li>Managing a <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> and <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code> to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.</li>
<li>Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">arising from outdated components</a>.</li>
<li>Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>graph</span></code>).</li>
<li>Streamline development workflow by loading <code><span>.env</span></code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly play with Pipenv right in your browser:</p>

<h2>Install Pipenv Today!<a href="#install-pipenv-today" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you’re using Fedora 28:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo dnf install pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, <strong>this is now discouraged</strong>, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You’ll then need to re-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:</p>

These are intended to replace <code><span>$</span> <span>pip</span> <span>install</span></code> usage, as well as manual virtualenv management (to activate a virtualenv, run <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>shell</span></code>).</p>
<div id="basic-concepts">
<h3>Basic Concepts<a href="#basic-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A virtualenv will automatically be created, when one doesn’t exist.</li>
<li>When no parameters are passed to <code><span>install</span></code>, all packages <code><span>[packages]</span></code> specified will be installed.</li>
<li>To initialize a Python 3 virtual environment, run <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>--three</span></code>.</li>
<li>To initialize a Python 2 virtual environment, run <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>--two</span></code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, whatever virtualenv defaults to will be the default.</li>

<ul>
<li><code><span>graph</span></code> will show you a dependency graph of your installed dependencies.</li>
<li><code><span>shell</span></code> will spawn a shell with the virtualenv activated. This shell can be deactivated by using <code><span>exit</span></code>.</li>
<li><code><span>run</span></code> will run a given command from the virtualenv, with any arguments forwarded (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>run</span> <span>python</span></code> or <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>run</span> <span>pip</span> <span>freeze</span></code>).</li>

<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>

<div id="a-quick-look">
<h2>A quick look<a href="#a-quick-look" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we show what happens when we use Python
to run a program that raises an exception.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Technology is a concentrating force. It always has been.</p>
<p>Everybody sewed their own clothes until we built textile factories.</p>
<p>It used to take one farmer to feed four people. Now each farmer feeds 130 people.</p>
<p>Home Depot killed thousands of local hardware stores. Opendoor is replacing legions of Keller-Williams agents. Salman Khan teaches algebra to more kids than the next 10,000 math teachers combined.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, <span>USD</span>, <span>CNY</span>, and <span>EUR</span> are all converging on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. <em>How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?</em></p>
<p>The internet, contrary to popular opinion, is accelerating the pace of centralization.</p>
<p>Software is centralizing in the App Store. Compute is centralizing in AWS-US-EAST-1. Culture is centralizing on TikTok. Stock trades are centralizing in Citadel’s dark pool. Politics are centralizing around personality. Work and cities are centralizing online.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a narrative mirage because three trends are frequently misinterpreted: the downfall of institutions, the death of the gatekeeper, and remote work.</p>
<p>These aren’t representative of decentralization, but instead are examples of increasing concentration.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-failing.">1.<span></span> <span>“</span>Institutions are failing.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/personality-is-the-force-majeure-of-the-internet">Personality is the force majeure of the internet</a>. In a noisy world, it’s much easier to diligence an individual than it is to understand institutional motives. <em>Who supports NPR? Who’s the <span>NYT</span><span></span><span>’</span>s customer? Advertisers? <span>PR</span> people? Me? What are we being sold?</em></p>
<p>Institutions aren’t crumbling because of decentralization, but rather the opposite: institutional power is being compressed into personalities.</p>
<p>Trump became the <span>GOP</span>. <span>AOC</span> is becoming the <span>DNC</span>. Dave Portnoy is becoming <span>ESPN</span>. Sam Harris is now <span>NPR</span>. Elon is Tesla.</p>
<p>Organizational power is inherently decentralized. Shareholders vote for board members. Boards approve plans. Plans coordinate across loosely-coupled internal orgs.</p>
<p>But individual power, like autocratic government, is singular.</p>
<p>Directives no longer need to flow through layers of hierarchy. Tesla no longer needs a network of dealers to sell cars on <a href="https://tesla.com/">tesla.com</a>, nor do they need an army of salespeople. Why listen to Bob at the local showroom when you can follow Elon on Twitter?</p>
<p>It’s the same in politics. We used to elect state representatives who would elect electors in the legislature who would elect a President. Then communication and transportation improved. We got railroads and national radio, so we put the Presidential candidates directly on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the President doesn’t even need <span>TV</span> stations: they can instantly drop messages into the pockets of <span>80M</span> followers.</p>
<p>Betting on the internet means betting against institutions,<a href="#footnote-11TX" id="ref-11TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not because institutions are exploding supernovas but because institutions are imploding black holes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gatekeepers-are-dead.">2.<span></span> <span>“</span>The gatekeepers are dead.”</h3>
<p>It’s true, gatekeepers are dead. It’s a huge improvement over the pre-Internet era.</p>
<p>I never learned about Richard Dawkins growing up. Then I went down a Carl Sagan <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> rabbit hole. I discovered Christopher Hitchens talking about evolution, consumed all of his religious debates, and then came across this Oxford evolutionary biologist who wore funny ties. <em>The Selfish Gene</em> fundamentally changed the way I view the world.</p>
<p>YouTube extends far beyond space videos. There’s debates about quantum theory, <span>DIY</span> construction how-to’s, makeup tutorials, and an unbelievable amount of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>The best part? There’s no school board deciding what you can and can’t watch and there’s no <span>MTV</span> exec telling David Dobrik what he can and can’t upload.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think the unlimited nature of content is a decentralizing force. Yet the reality is that winning content in an unlimited world is watched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift can reach billions of listeners, Salman Khan can teach algebra to millions of students, the best Stack Overflow answers get upvoted thousands of times.</p>
<p>Imagine if San Francisco had no zoning rules. There’d be cranes and giant skyscrapers everywhere. The city would be reaching Tokyo-level density, concentrating people in the Bay Area from across the country.</p>
<p>The internet is a supercharged no-zoning Bay Area. YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Shopify are all limitless. Their success is exponential, like the weight of gravity, pulling in more and more eyeballs.</p>
<p>The gap between first place and second place is far more pronounced online than it ever was offline. 30-45% of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. Walmart managed to handle only 9% of physical retail at their peak.<a href="#footnote-21TX" id="ref-21TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Power is shifting to the dancer who can get featured by TikTok’s algorithm, to the business that can place first in Google’s results, to the reseller that pays the most to top Amazon’s catalog, to the singer that can get featured in Spotify’s <em>Discover Weeklies</em>.</p>
<p>The long tail of content is a distraction from the reality: online power is concentrating in an extreme power law. Yes, anybody can build a following. But the winners dwarf the long tail.</p>
<p>After all, audiences are so concentrated that it only took three companies to silence the sitting <span>POTUS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-remote-work">3.<span></span> <span>“</span>But what about remote work?”</h3>
<p>I miss going into Industrious. I’d wake up, walk to FiDi, pour myself a cup of coffee in a grey mug, sit in a mid-century modern green chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>When I flew to Chicago, I’d take a train to the Fulton Market Industrious, pour myself coffee in a grey mug, sit on a mid-century chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>Fly to Atlanta? Ride to Ponce. Coffee, grey mug, green chair, work.</p>
<p>New York? Union Square. Coffee. Chair. Work.</p>
<p>As people move their work lives online, the experience everywhere is going to be the same. Morning ride on the Peloton, get to WeWork, drink some Blue Bottle, hop on a video call, order groceries from Instacart, rinse and repeat. The only difference will be whether we see palm trees or wildfire smoke out the window.</p>
<p>The<span></span> <span>“</span>everyone is leaving <span>SF</span><span></span><span>”</span> narrative isn’t about decentralization, it’s about centralizing online. Everybody is on Zoom now.<span></span> <span>“</span>Remote work” doesn’t mean you can now live some exotic life in a faraway place, it means that people in Birmingham can live the same as those in Cow Hollow. And work for the same companies, too.</p>
<p>Not only are we all working on Zoom, but we’re all shopping on the same<span></span> <span>“</span>hip” street, the one with Warby Parker and Bonobos and Lululemon and La Colombe all lined up side by side. Sub-in Blue Bottle, and I’ll tell you if you’re east or west of the Mississippi.<a href="#footnote-31TX" id="ref-31TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of it is that capital is cheap and management can be centralized, so chains are able to grow quickly nationwide without leaning on franchise models.<a href="#footnote-41TX" id="ref-41TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the other part is that our tastes as Americans are compressing. Every town has incredible breweries, third wave coffee, Trader Joe’s, and a Costco out in the suburbs. We’re all watching Netflix and Charli D’Amelio. We’re all peddling to the same bike instructors as Biden. How much longer until we all lose our regional accents, too?</p>
<h3 id="uploading">Uploading…</h3>
<p>Everything is shifting online. From how we find office space, to get rides, to feed ourselves, to exercise, to work and to live.</p>
<p>The meme that this constitutes<span></span> <span>“</span>decentralization” is like the ocean on the edge of the Saharan horizon. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The spectrum of opinions, of tastes, of behaviors is compressing. The platforms and personalities with power will continue to grow in size. The power law of the internet remains irrefutable.</p>
<p>Soon one farmer will feed 1,300 people, robots will sew our Nikes, there will be one nationwide math teacher and a single wealth ledger.</p>
<p>And our lives will be fully uploaded.</p>

If you’re starting with this one, you may want to have a look at: </em><a href="https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager"><span><em>https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager</em></span></a></p><p>Amazing, talented, hard-working, accomplished folks who’ve reported to me over the years have asked: “What do I need to do to get to the next level?” In most cases, because I needed them, I have to admit I have sometimes stopped short of complete candor. If I could have, I would have said: “Find the job you want to have at another company and then quit this one.” There is also the version of: “Find the job you want at this company and then transfer to that one.” I’ve never stood in the way of anyone leaving my team and getting their next job, and I’ve always helped in any way I could to make it happen. So, my career advice is “Be a quitter.” There are some dimensions to that reductionist statement…</p><p><em>My very first programming job was when I was sixteen years old, when I worked for a company creating educational games for the TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, and IBM PCs. When I had worked for them for about three years and was heading to college, they were still paying me eight dollars an hour. I was as good or better than their older programmers so I asked them for a raise to fifteen dollars an hour. They had recently started to become more of a “business” and had hired a biz school grad to manage their operations. He wouldn’t go for it. I quit and took a job cooking in a restaurant that happened to be on the ground floor of my girlfriend’s dorm building for fifteen dollars an hour. I got some good cooking experience and a few months later I got another software job with a company that did portfolio accounting for big Wall Street firms. They paid me a lot more than fifteen dollars an hour, and I later dropped out of college to work for them full time.</em></p><p>Right from the start of your career I recommend that you pay attention to what engages you about your job and what turns you off. Make pro/con lists at some regular intervals, perhaps at quarterly review time. Are you getting enough of the pros from your job vs. the cons? Are there opportunities to shift the balance in your current role? Are there things you could add that would be pros that you’re not doing at all? Are there things that you’ve only done once in that last quarter that you really enjoyed? Try to do that again. Don’t pay that much attention to what you “should” do, pay attention to what you want to do.&nbsp;</p><p>If money is on your list, find out what you’re worth by spending some time getting some other offers. Don’t try to coerce your manager into paying you more by dropping offer letters in front of them. Instead, just talk to them about what you think you should be making in your current role and why.</p><p>If you really don’t see a way to pursue the things that motivate you via your current role, then this is a signal to start looking inside and outside the company for your next role.</p><p><em>I was a principal software engineer on a large team writing business productivity software. I wanted to be a software architect. I had been working fairly autonomously on a feature that touched every damn thing in the product. So you could say I was already doing software architecture work. But, because I was young they were reluctant to promote me. I saw another team that was fucking up wildly and they desperately needed architectural guidance. So I talked to my boss and asked to help them out. It was a huge mess to unravel but I managed to create a good architecture out of it and rewrite a lot of it. I also got the team members contributing better as well. After that, when I asked for a promotion they gave it to me. Partly because they acknowledged that I was qualified, and partly because I owned two large feature areas and they couldn’t afford to lose me.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>If you want to get to the next level, ask for next level responsibilities when there is an opportunity. A new project, a new sub-team, a crisis that needs to be sorted out, etc.--any of these are places where you can volunteer to take on more scope. Essentially that is what “career growth” is: getting more scope of influence. This kind of informal tryout is good for you and for your boss. It lets you figure out if these are really the things that motivate you and whether you are any good at them. It lets your boss see you as the next level without committing to a promotion. Of course some bosses are assholes and (even if you do well) will just try to use you again in this role without a promotion. I would say that risk is worth it to get the tryout and if you have an asshole boss you should (you guessed it) quit.</p><p>I can’t tell you the number of people who have pursued me for promotions who weren’t good at their current job. I’m sure that works with incompetent managers who want to just pass their problems along to other folks while failing up themselves, but I’m not talking about them. You’ll know you’re great at your current job when the 360 feedback from peers, supervisors, and stakeholders confirms this--that’s when you should try to get the next job. A real challenge in this is that sometimes you’re good at something that you don’t like all that much. You are left with a choice: Pursue the thing you’re strong at or perhaps go for something that makes you happy that you’re just okay at. I don’t know the right answer; you have to choose.</p><p><em>After some years at a Very Large Multinational Technology Company I had reached a point where I was flying back and forth across the United States with PowerPoint decks telling “stories” to partner companies. I wasn’t learning anything except how to get the most frequent flyer points. I was not happy. I went looking for a company that was smaller, more focused, and where I could be an individual contributor again. I found a little place doing cool work that I was interested in. They were a small tight knit group of really talented folks. The interview was really hard. I learned a lot about truly collaborating on a project, taking feedback, and using asynchronous communication effectively. I got deep into Linux, Python, test automation, Windows distributed security, and about a thousand other things. I started coding for fun again during that job and haven’t really stopped since. There was a lot of blunt feedback, but in response to that, I got even better than I thought I was going in.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worst place to learn anything is a place where you are the smartest person in the room. When you’re interviewing companies (or other teams), one of your goals should be to see if you are going to learn anything from them. That education is worth more than money. Learning is what gives drive and interest to your career. If you’re not learning, you’re sliding backwards. This is why chasing easy money, and hopping from money-wasting startup to money-wasting startup, is not a good way to develop a strong career. It isn’t always easy to be learning on the job, and it comes with stress and sometimes uncomfortable feedback, but I think it is worth it in the long run.</p><p><em>I was leading a scrum team at a small e-commerce company and as part of a project we were doing, someone had to write some deployment scripts. This involved writing some shell script and a little work in Lua on Nginx. When the task came up during planning, the task wasn’t claimed so I assigned it to one of the more senior engineers. The next several stand up meetings this engineer was in a very bad mood with me. I finally had a talk with them and they informed me that they were a “Java Engineer” and that they didn’t appreciate being given tasks that weren’t Java. I told them that their job title was “Software Engineer,” and that they would use whatever software tool was required to build the systems we needed. Needless to say, this conversation didn’t help them in their quest for advancement. I can only imagine what has happened to this person since then, with the rise of JavaScript on the backend and the long dragged out death of Java.</em></p><p>It is okay to get to a certain point and just stay there because you’re happy, challenged, and still learning. A key thing to be wary of in these contexts is to not let the market leave you behind. Don’t be a Java engineer or a Python engineer: be a Software Engineer. Be comfortable in multiple environments and idioms. In the software field, languages and tools and operating systems go out of style. It isn’t that there is really something better, it is just that people tend to herd towards new things periodically. You should pay attention and update your skills, put the new tech into your current job (or get a new job with new tech). I’ve had to lay folks off in the past and there is nothing sadder than “senior” folks, whose skills are a decade out of date, trying to attain the same level in a market that has moved on. You become at best an entry level person with commensurate lower salary expectations.</p><p>Don’t take a management role if you don’t like it and/or you don’t have any aptitude for it. There are plenty of ways to figure this out before taking a management role. Being a great engineer is not an important qualification for being a great manager. Many companies make this stupid assumption because they were founded by engineers, and they typically have a lot of crappy managers (who are former engineers) who really don’t like managing people. You are much better off solving your money problems or level problems inside the engineering track than switching over to the management track. Also, the employees that would have to suffer under you will appreciate you staying in the engineering track.</p><p>In the long run, it is better to have the right role than to always have a steadily increasing salary. Of course, this assumes that you have your finances in order and can afford to do this. I would say that being able to have this option is very useful in career progression.

            <p>Don’t use Homebrew Python. It’s not meant for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>At some point Homebrew made changes that adversely affect Python development. While Homebrew’s Python formula has been the go-to choice for Python developers (including me) for a long time, that time is past — there are now <em>much</em> better options&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" title="I’ve talked about some macOS-specific reasons to eschew its bundled Python, but Ubuntu/Debian is also affected.">1</a></sup>, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable&nbsp;error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dyld</span><span>:</span> <span>Library</span> <span>not</span> <span>loaded</span><span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>executable_path</span><span>/../</span><span>.</span><span>Python</span>
<span>Referenced</span> <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>/your/home/.virtualenvs/your-env-name/bin/</span><span>python</span>
<span>Reason</span><span>:</span> <span>image</span> <span>not</span> <span>found</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change&nbsp;anything!</p>
<p><em>You</em> didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did. Of the adverse changes Homebrew made recently, two stand out as root causes of this&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>First, Homebrew now upgrades dependent packages automatically. So if you upgrade <em>any</em> package that depends on the <code>python</code> formula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" title="You can see which of your installed formulae depend on the python formula by running: brew uses python --installed … I have over 30 Python-dependent formulae installed on my workstation.">2</a></sup> (and there are nearly <strong>400</strong> of them), then your Python interpreter will be upgraded also — whether you like it or not. You have no control over&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Second, Homebrew now automatically deletes previous versions every 30 days, including of course any Python interpreters you used to create virtual&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>The havoc wrought by the combination of these two changes is considerable. Those Python virtual environments you created over the last year? All of them are now broken. Why? Just because you ran <code>brew upgrade ponysay</code>? Yup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" title="Previously, you had to manually run brew cleanup to get yourself into this mess. Now the carnage happens automatically. Any time a new Python version is released, even patch releases such as from 3.8.6 to 3.8.7, there is the very real potential that any virtual environment that depends on the previous Python version will just break horribly and without any warning. And it’s not just your virtual environments — any software that depends on Python can have the carpet yanked out from under it, including Pipx, YouCompleteMe, and other components that you may not even realize depend on the presence of a stable Python foundation. Moreover, this problem isn’t even confined to Python. Need a specific version of Node.js to build static assets for your web application? Have an old Rails app that needs a previous Ruby version? Under the Homebrew regime, those can also be swept away at any&nbsp;time.">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="homebrew-python-is-not-for-you">Homebrew Python Is Not For&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>The web is littered with frustrated reports about this problem and replete with hacked-together Bash scripts that purport to repair damaged Python virtual environments. And all because of one core&nbsp;misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Homebrew’s Python is not for you. It exists to serve Homebrew, or more accurately, Homebrew’s other formulae. The primary purpose of Homebrew’s Python formula is to enable other Python-dependent Homebrew packages to work. If installing Homebrew’s Python allows you to run the occasional Python script or access the <abbr title="read-eval-print loop"><span>REPL</span></abbr><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" title="Assuming you’re okay with bundled Python caveats, there’s no reason to install Homebrew just for Python, since macOS includes Python 3 in its command-line tools (CLT) package.">4</a></sup>, that’s a nice side benefit, but anything beyond that — including developing software with Python — is squarely&nbsp;out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Once you come to this realization, it should be clear that this is the wrong tool for the job. So what is the right&nbsp;tool?</p>

<p>There are several solutions that put <strong>you</strong> back in control of when Python versions are installed, upgraded, and removed. Personally, I use <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python">Python plugin</a> to do <a href="https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">just that</a>. I prefer <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> to similar tools such as Pyenv and Pythonz because not only can you install multiple Python versions but also multiple Node.js versions, Ruby versions, and <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list">many more</a>.</p>
<p>After switching to this solution, would you like to guess how many times I’ve had something break due to a Python upgrade? Right: <em>Zero</em>. Zero times. Because <strong>I</strong> am now in control of when older Python versions are swept away, I can upgrade virtual environments at my leisure, and then, once I’ve confirmed no other environments rely on older versions, I can then uninstall those old Python versions without worrying about something&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>There are hack workarounds, and I’ve tried them. None of them fix the core&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>For example, the automatic monthly clean-up can be disabled by defining a <code>HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP</code> environment variable and setting it to “1”. But all it takes is one accidental <code>brew</code> invocation in a shell session where that variable is not set, and your environments are laid to waste. Plus, even if you avoid that footgun, there is no easy way to remove specific old versions that you may no longer need; you have no choice but to <code>rm -rf</code> directories in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/</code> and hope you don’t break&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I also tried to avoid installing Homebrew Python entirely, with the idea that since I’m not using it anymore, I don’t need it to be installed. But assuming you use Homebrew to install other tools, that would be a fool’s errand — Homebrew Python will almost certainly be installed anyway when some other formula requires it. But that doesn’t mean we have to use it! Let the Homebrewed Python sit there and do its job serving other formulae, and we can forget it&nbsp;exists.</p>

a description of some property of your system from a description of the domain

you're new to this, I recommend trying to write at least one proptest, then
reading the advice below.</p> <p>This is not going to be a basic 'How to proptest' tutorial. There are many, many
treatments of that subject; you should probably start with the documentation for
your language's proptest library. A few of my favorites are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proptest (Rust)</a> (We use this extensively at Auxon)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test.check (Clojure)</a></li> <li><a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis (Python)</a></li></ul> <p>Property-based testing libraries are extensively available. There's probably one
you can use in your language of choice.</p> <h3 id="why-proptest"><a href="#why-proptest">#</a> Why Proptest?</h3> <p>Testing and specification can be thought of as a spectrum of rigor. On the
least-rigorous end, we have manual testing and regular written specifications.
Moving up, we find automated unit / integration test and executable
specification languages (like Cucumber, another popular tool at Auxon). Then
there's a massive gulf, and everything gets starts getting academic and
difficult; symbolic execution, model checking, and formal proofs show up at the far end.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.auxon.io/images/posts/effective-property-based-testing-1.png" alt="property-based"></p> <p>Proptests are somewhere in the middle, just a little past the tests you're
already doing. They're a very practical way of verifying your implementation
against a rigorous, executable specification. But they're not much harder to
write than the unit tests you're already doing.</p> <h3 id="terminology-check"><a href="#terminology-check">#</a> Terminology Check</h3> <p>Different proptest libraries use different words to talk about the same thing.
In this article, I'll use 'Generator' to talk about the thing that defines the
input domain for your proptest. (Some people refer to proptests as generative
testing). This is also known as a 'Strategy' in Rust proptest / Python
hypothesis parlance.</p> <p>Code examples will be written in Rust, but the concepts and recommendations
apply to any proptest framework.</p> <h2 id="write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite"><a href="#write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite">#</a> Write 'em, Compose 'em, Put 'em in a Suite</h2> <h3 id="item-1-develop-a-generator-library"><a href="#item-1-develop-a-generator-library">#</a> Item 1: Develop a Generator Library</h3> <p>Your program probably has a bunch of classes or data structures that it cares
about deeply, that are central to its operation and passed all around the
system. You should identify theses data structures and write generators for
them. You can do this incrementally, as you begin to work with proptests.</p> <h3 id="item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators"><a href="#item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators">#</a> Item 2: Be a little suspicious of type-based generators</h3> <p>Many proptest frameworks provide a way to make a generator directly from a
structure, type, or schema definition. These are of course very convenient, and
I've used them often. But they're not as clearly good as you might think.</p> <p>First, your types may not be as precise as what you need for your generators.
Maybe you have a single type which can have two distinct data variants (maybe
both valid and invalid requests?) which you want to generate separately. Second,
event if your type definition is fully precise, you may find that practical
execution considerations require you to make size or other input domain
restrictions in the generators. This happens fairly frequently.</p> <p>For these reasons, I recommend staying away for type-based generators for all
but the most simple applications. We've found that's it's best to just start
with standalone generators; it costs a little more up front, but I always end up
converting to them later on anyways. Clojure's <code>core.spec</code>-based generators are
an exception here, as they provide an ad-hoc way to override portions of the
generated generator. But even then, it's a fairly laborious process.</p> <h3 id="item-3-touch-test-your-generators"><a href="#item-3-touch-test-your-generators">#</a> Item 3: Touch-test your generators</h3> <p>When you're writing your generators, use your language's interactive execution
facilities to try them out. It's common to find unexpected variations in
proptest-generated data, and this can help you shortcut the "WHY did my tests
fail?" process. I've had a lot of success using this technique in Clojure.</p> <h3 id="item-4-learn-your-combinators"><a href="#item-4-learn-your-combinators">#</a> Item 4: Learn your Combinators</h3> <p>Proptest libraries are built from small generators that can be combined to form
more complex structures. Some of these are language/environment dependent, but
the important ones are common:</p> <ul><li><p>Primitive types - You'll start with generators for all the primitives in your
language: integers, floats, strings, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Collection types - Look for direct support for native collections in your
framework; you can use these to generate a collection of anything else you can
generate. Note that collection size can be bounded; you'll find this necessary
when developing larger compound generators.</p></li> <li><p><code>just</code> / <code>return</code> - Proptest frameworks always have a way to 'lift' a single
value, creating a generator that just spits out that value every time.</p></li> <li><p><code>map</code> - Transform a generated value in some way. You might use this to
generate numbers that have been converted to strings.</p></li> <li><p><code>filter</code> - Throw out generated values if they don't pass some test. This is
convenient but a little dangerous; see <a href="#filtering">below</a>.</p></li> <li><p><code>tuple</code> - Get data from multiple generators together. (This is kind of like
'and')</p></li> <li><p><code>one of</code> / <code>choose</code> - Get data from one of the given generators. (This is kind
of like 'or')</p></li> <li><p>data structures - Different frameworks approach this differently, but most
provide some amount of sugar to help you generate native data structures.
Lacking that, one effective strategy is to start with a <code>tuple</code> generator with
one item for each field in your data structure, then use <code>map</code> generator to
put them all together.</p></li> <li><p>recursive structures - If you want to generate a tree or some other kind of
recursive data structure, look for direct support for that in your framework.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering"><a href="#item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering">#</a> Item 5: Prefer Constructive Generation to Filtering</h3> <p>The <code>filter</code> combinator is really easy, and one of the first things people
reach for when writing proptests for the first time. The trouble with this
is that it's inefficient, and it can break down entirely when used broadly.</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to make a generator for even numbers. It's easy to do with <code>filter</code>:</p> <p>This works, but it's doing a lost of wasted work: half of all the numbers
generated by the first step will be thrown out. Suppose you did the same thing
to generate multiples of 10: you'll be throwing away 90% of your work. Powers of
two? That's way out of hand. Most proptest frameworks will abort execution if
they aren't able to generate a valid sample after some number of tries.</p> <p>This is not only a problem with single value generators: you'll find that as you
start to combine generators to produce more complex structures, the effects of
multiple filter-based generators will accumulate, and you'll be aborting
execution all the time.</p> <p>The solution to this is to instead build your generators constructively. Start
with a fully specified domain, then transform that to get what you want. This
can be tricky, and sometimes requires oblique thinking to get it right. In the
case of our even numbers, it's not too bad:</p> <p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule; there are plenty of times where <code>filter</code> is
the only choice. But you should beware of your <code>filter</code>'s selectivity, and be
careful of using it too much.</p> <h3 id="item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies"><a href="#item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies">#</a> Item 6: Use flatmap/bind for Data Dependencies</h3> <p>Many data structures have some kind of internal consistency requirement. For
example, you might have a record that contains a vector of strings, and an index
into that list representing a cursor. We'd like to only generate valid cursors.
(Sometimes you want to generate <em>invalid</em> cursors as well, of course)</p> <p>The naive way to do this might be to start with a <code>tuple</code> of the vector
generator and a cursor generator, and then use <code>filter</code> to remove all tuples
where the cursor is out of bounds:</p> <p>This is a correct and succinct way to specify the constraint, but you'll find
that your proptest framework probably gives up after generating too many
candidates that don't match. It's radically inefficient at best.</p> <p>The constructive way to do this is to start with a generator for the list of
strings, and then use <code>flatmap</code> (or <code>bind</code>, the names vary) to generate an
in-bounds index:</p> <h3 id="item-7-bound-your-collections"><a href="#item-7-bound-your-collections">#</a> Item 7: Bound your collections</h3> <p>When you're making generators for collection-typed values (Vectors, Lists,
Maps, etc), it's tempting to say "do this for ALL the possible collections!" In
terms of specification, that's correct. But in terms of execution, it can get
out of hand. Does your system <em>really</em> need to be able to handle 200 million
distinct zip codes?</p> <p>This can get especially bad if you have compound data structures with collections nested under other collections. Even if your implementation can gracefully handle the load, you may find that your proptest framework cannot.</p> <p>You should carefully consider what you actually care about verifying,
and target that. I often choose a 'reasonable' (which depends on the context)
limit to the size of straight collections of simple values. When dealing with
nested collections, the "zero, one, many" rule of thumb applies; <code>many == 2 or 3</code> typically works well.</p> <h2 id="look-it-s-a-propiphaunt"><a href="#look-it-s-a-propiphaunt">#</a> Look! It's a Propiphaunt!</h2> <h3 id="item-8-start-small"><a href="#item-8-start-small">#</a> Item 8: Start small</h3> <p>When you're bringing proptest into a code base for the first time, it's tempting
to Specify All The Things. This is unfortunately a good way to fail. If you jump
into the deep end, you'll find that your proptests are mysteriously failing or
hanging in ways you can't explain. It's important to go at this incrementally as
you develop a feel for what kinds of generators your system needs, and what
kinds of properties you can feasibly verify.</p> <p>Start by proptesting your pure …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>During this global pandemic, online video calls have become essential to the way we work. Millions of workers are now accustomed to hopping on calls with their colleagues to hash things out that they would previously have done in person. Zoom has shown itself to be a reliable partner for video conferencing. However, as a company, Zoom has given <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">reasons to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users">avoid</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/876351501/zoom-acknowledges-it-suspended-activists-accounts-at-china-s-request">its software.</a></p>

<p>The world’s new reliance on video conferencing got me thinking: <em>How hard could it be to build a video conferencing web application?</em> Like most things worth doing, the answer was <em>difficult, but fun</em>.</p>

<p>When I first started researching for this project, I discovered that there isn’t much information out there about building a WebRTC-based application from start to finish. Mozilla’s WebRTC documentation is invaluable, but it lacked answers to some of the questions I had. And tutorials that exist generally only cover connecting two users in a fairly basic way. I wanted to do something more ambitious.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-going-to-build">What we’re going to build:</h2>

<p>In this article, we’re going to build a real-time video chat application with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will allow users to create video chat rooms with a unique slug, allowing any user to join.</li>
  <li>The app will keep track of which users are connected to the given room.</li>
  <li>The app will allow users to establish a group video call with eachother through WebRTC peer connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that sounds easy enough. Creating pages with central information on the fly in a web app is the bread and butter of any self-respecting web framework—and with Phoenix it’s a piece of cake. Tracking users seems a little tricky, but if you’ve heard of what LiveView and PubSub can do, you can probably guess that we’re still on the right track. WebRTC was designed for video calls, but group video calls? That might get complex. Plus, how would that even work if each of the connections is only peer-to-peer? We’ll get to that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://littlechat.app/">We’ve wrapped up the finished product and deployed it at littlechat.app</a>. Try creating a room and hopping on it with a friend or two. That’s what we’re going to create.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/littlelines/littlechat">You can also find the source code for this project here if you’re more of the self-guided type.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>I’m going to assume that you are comfortable working with Elixir and Phoenix. I’ll assume that you might have toyed around with LiveView a few times before this article, but it doesn’t take much to get up to speed. Finally, I’ll assume you have no WebRTC experience beyond having heard about it a few times.</p>

<p>We will be using the latest versions of Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView in this article, which are the following at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir 1.10.3</li>
  <li>Erlang 23.0.2</li>
  <li>Phoenix 1.5.3</li>
  <li>Phoenix LiveView 0.13.3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC</h3>

<p>Web Real Time Communication, or WebRTC for short, is a technology that allows real-time, peer-to-peer communication between users. It provides an API for handling user video, audio, and other data via peer-to-peer connections.</p>

<p>WebRTC has been around since 2011, but implementation by the various browsers has been uneven over the years. Nowadays, each browser has a more consistent WebRTC implementation, making browser support much better, but implementing it can still be a dance.</p>

<p>What makes WebRTC so flexible—and, at times, confounding—is that it has no standardized server-side implementation. WebRTC does not care how users in a video chat learn about each other and send their connection information, it only handles how to connect those users once their information has been sent. This originally confused me, as I was not sure where the server-side <em>signaling</em> (the WebRTC term for the process of telling two users about each other for a peer connection) ended and the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> began. We’ll dig into this later.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Elixir’s Phoenix framework allows us to build reliable and performant web applications built on Erlang’s rock-solid foundation. On any project, my first instinct these days is to reach for Phoenix. But the motivation goes deeper.</p>

<p>Elixir is built on Erlang’s VM, which was specifically developed for the challenges of the telecoms industry, where fault-tolerance and high-availability are essential. That sounds perfect for this project.</p>

<h3 id="liveview">LiveView</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> is one of my favorite components of Phoenix. It makes real-time user interaction between the client’s UI and the server seamless, without needing to write (much) JavaScript. LiveView makes real-time user interactions much easier to build and maintain, all while working within familiar concepts: Phoenix, Elixir, and OTP.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Have you got all your tools ready? Let’s go!</p>

<p>First, we’re going to create a new Phoenix project with LiveView already configured. If you’re trying to add video chat to an existing app without LiveView already configured, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html#content">LiveView is pretty easy to set up from scratch too.</a> We’re going to call our project Littlechat, a portmenteau of Littlelines and chat.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.new littlechat --live</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s <code>cd littlechat</code> into our brand new app and install its dependencies.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>littlechat
<span>$ </span>mix deps.get
<span>$ </span>npm install --prefix assets</code></pre></div>

<p>Standard stuff. Let’s go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-rooms">Creating the Rooms</h2>

<p>Users can’t connect to each other if they don’t have a place to meet, so let’s build them a room!</p>

<p>Let’s create a <em>context</em> called <code>Organizer</code> with a schema <code>Room</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.gen.context Organizer Room rooms title:string slug:string</code></pre></div>

<p>That generated a few files for us, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</code>, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer/room.ex</code>, and a migration file ending in <code>XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</code> Let’s start with our Room schema.</p>

<p>Our rooms will only have two data to start, <code>slug</code> and <code>title</code>, both strings. <code>slug</code> will be the unique identifier for the room, so we’ll need to add a unique index to the database to prevent collisions. Let’s set up the database:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># priv/repo/migrations/XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Repo.Migrations.CreateRooms</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto.Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>"rooms"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:slug</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>

    <span>end</span>

    <span>create</span> <span>unique_index</span><span>(</span><span>:rooms</span><span>,</span> <span>:slug</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For the schema, we’re going to create a basic changeset function with the added <code>unique_constraint</code> on slug. But we’re also going to add a private function, <code>format_slug/1</code> for the purpose of cleaning our slug input.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/room.ex</span>

<p>Great! Now we can create rooms in the database. What about getting one from the DB? Easy.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</span>

  <li>Inside of this template, we create a basic form for creating a new Room. Note the reference to the <code>@changeset</code> assign.</li>
  <li>We then tell the form (via LiveView) to send the event <code>"validate"</code> to the server every time user input is added.</li>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German government is preparing a massive investment plan to boost the development of local telecoms firms, in an effort to pivot away from dominant suppliers like China's Huawei.</p>



<p>The plan, dubbed the "joint proposal for action" by the ministries of interior, economy, research and transport, and seen by POLITICO, lays out how the government plans to spend €2 billion in funding from its larger coronavirus recovery stimulus program <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/konjunkturpaket-1757640" target="_blank">presented in June</a>.</p>



<p>"The prosperity and competitiveness of Germany and Europe will increasingly depend on mastering new communication technologies," the proposal said, adding that this would "require a common political and industrial commitment at national and European level." </p>



<p>The plan comes as European governments increasingly take steps to box out Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G-rollout plans due to security concerns. The restrictions mean telecoms operators have become more reliant on Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia, triggering calls from telecoms <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">operators</a> and some lawmakers to open up the supply chain to new players.</p>



<p>The German draft proposal includes over €300 million of investment in Open RAN technology, €237 million for a 6G research hub and €250 million to boost demand and expand 5G networks.</p>



<p>The draft also earmarked €550 million of German public investment in Europe's microchip market through a joint project, <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">announced Tuesday</a>, between the government, the EU and local industry players.</p>



<p>The draft proposal was <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/open-ran-geheimpapier-milliarden-fuer-neue-mobilfunktechnik-sollen-abhaengigkeit-von-huawei-verringern/26830274.html?ticket=ST-5932468-7f1AIvazemqcyVbktwbi-ap6" target="_blank">first reported by Handelsblatt</a>.</p>



<h3>Looking for new 5G</h3>



<p>The government wants to prioritize "open RAN" technologies throughout its telecoms investment plan, a concept that would chop up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and break the market power of large end-to-end vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>Ericsson and Nokia "for long have held a globally good position," the text said, but "China is however technological frontrunner in 5G mobile networks." </p>



<p>"Germany and Europe need to urgently strengthen their competences and develop industrial ecosystems for Open RAN and 6G technologies, including hardware and software," it said.</p>



<p>The adoption of Open RAN could mean a blow for Ericsson and Nokia, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">have benefited</a> from the pushback against Huawei. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/oran-reflow-huawei-europe-telecoms-5g/">the concept is heavily favored by telecoms operators</a>, who use the equipment and complain that they are too reliant on gear from the two European suppliers.</p>



<p>The plan seeks to facilitate "Germany's entry into technologies for Open RAN solutions," with hopes to establish new companies in niche markets like network integration and edge computing software.</p>



<p>These services and products are currently part of major contracts between operators and major vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. </p>



<p>Experts have warned that the Open RAN technology is still immature and it could take years for these new types of networks to function as well as conventional 5G systems.</p>



<p>But the concept has gained influence in countries including the U.S. and the U.K., where lawmakers sought ways to replace Huawei.</p>



<p>In the European Union, Germany so far has been among the most eager to promote the concept — which is also heavily favored by its telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom as it looks to exit its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/deutsche-telekom-huawei-us-security-measures/">dependency on Huawei equipment</a>.</p>



<h3>Microchip plan</h3>



<p>Also on Tuesday, the German government said it wants to boost the German and European semiconductor industry with new EU, German and private investments to boost chip manufacturing and design firms.</p>



<p>“We want Germany and Europe to become more sovereign and independent of imports when it comes to microelectronics and communication technologies," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, announcing the <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">government's plan</a> to launch a so-called Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), elected projects that are set up to allow EU and national public funding to help private companies develop new technologies like microchips.. </p>



<p>The global semiconductor supply chain is dominated by U.S., Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean firms. Europe lags far behind in the supply of high-end chips, though it has a handful of companies that champion supply-chain niches like chip-printing machines and chips for cars.</p>



<p>The German call to launch an IPCEI project comes in the wake of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/computer-chip-shortage-disrupts-global-car-production/a-56224486" target="_blank">warnings by its car industry</a> last month that a chip shortage was disrupting its production.</p>



<p>The European Commission is also working on a strategy to catch up on chips. It <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572339">launched discussions</a> with Europe’s leading firms in a bid to launch an “alliance” of firms, institutes and national governments to pool investments and set up joint projects this spring, including a manufacturing plant for high-end chips.</p>



<p><em>This article was updated to reflect that Important Projects of Common European Interest are approved under EU state aid rules.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.
</p><div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code that is usually …</p></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.opsian.com/blog/profiling-and-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.opsian.com/blog/profiling-and-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/what-is-profiling/">last post</a> in our <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/tags/profiling-in-production/">Profiling in Production series</a> we covered instrumentation and sampling profilers. We talked about “resources of interest” but which ones are the most useful for diagnosing performance bottlenecks? The most commonly used resource is time. We’ve been deliberately vague about the concept of timing so far because when it comes to computers there’s actually two types of timing.</p>
<p>The first is <em>CPU Time</em>. This is the time that your code actually spends executing code on the CPU. The other type of time that we’re interested in measuring is <em>Wallclock time</em>. Wallclock time is the total time between starting an operation and it completing.</p>
<p><img alt="A coffee shop at lunch time" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/profiling_in_production_series/coffee_shop.png" title="A coffee shop at lunch time"></p>
<p>The way that we like to think of the difference between the two types of profiling is that it's a bit like buying a coffee. If you go to any good coffee shop, or a Starbucks at lunchtime, then you'll find they tend to be pretty busy with a queue forming at the bar. In order to drink the delightful caffeinated beverage you desire you need to both get through the queue to be served and also have the barista make your coffee. CPU Time is the time that the barista spends making coffee - it's the actual time spent performing work. The Wallclock time is the total time it takes for you to get a coffee including waiting to be served.</p>
<p>Now you maybe wondering why CPU Time and Wallclock time aren’t the same number: after all your Java process doesn't have to wait in line at Starbucks. Code may not be running on a CPU for a variety of reasons. For example, it might be blocked on a lock, not scheduled on CPU due to too many threads running or have gone to sleep.</p>
<h4>So when should you use the different types of time?</h4>
<p><em>CPU Time</em> is more useful for problems where there are few threads showing high CPU usage, as many event-loop style applications do. You may see plenty of time being spent in other threads that are waiting around performing background work but aren't actually limiting the throughput of your application. So CPU Time is useful when you know you’re bottlenecked on processing capacity. This is often the case in applications where significant processing needs to happen for each request or event. Machine learning systems are a common example.</p>
<p><em>Wallclock Time</em> is useful for problems where CPU utilisation seems low but application throughput or latency doesn't meet expectations. This is because threads are probably blocked on something, for example multiple threads contenting on a lock, times when you're waiting for downstream network IO to happen or running with too many threads so some of them don't get scheduled. The trigger for looking at Wallclock time would be low CPU usage during your period of performance issues. This tends to happen in modern microservices deployments when services spend time blocked on other services - which limits overall throughput.</p>
<p>In summary, so far in this series we’ve learnt about the relative merits of instrumentation and sampling profilers and the most common timing types and where they should be used. In the next post we’re going to cover how sampling Java profilers specifically work and how to pick one that’s suitable for production.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We are going to be creating a product landing page which will utilize 3D models and particle effects to take product showcasing to a whole new level. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the concepts of working with a 3D environment in the browser, while using modern tooling, to create your own highly performant 3D sites.</p><p>The final project can be viewed at <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://3d-product-page.netlify.app/">3d-product-page.netlify.app/</a></span></p><p>And the final code can be viewed at <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/molebox/3d-product-page">github.com/molebox/3d-product-page</a></span></p><p>This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of the following:</p><ul role="list"><li>React</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>CSS</li><li>The command line</li></ul><p>What tools are we using?</p><p>Snowpack</p><p>We are going to be using <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">snowpack</a></span> as our build tool. Its a modern tool that is similar to Webpack, but takes a slightly different approach. Instead of bundling our entire application and recompiling on every code change and save, snowpack only rebuilds single files where the changes have been made. This results in a very fast development process. The term used by the snowpack team is <strong>unbundled development</strong> where individual files are loaded to the browser during development with ESM syntax.</p><p>Chakra-ui</p><p>Our application will be written in React and use <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chakra-ui.com/">Chakra-ui</a></span> for styling. Chakra is an accessibility first component library which comes with superb defaults and enables us to build accessible, modular components at speed. Think of styled components with easy theming and composability.</p><p>Threejs and react-three-fiber</p><p>We will be utilizing Threejs by way of a wonderful React library called <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">react-three-fiber</a></span>, which allows us to easily interact with Three using common React techniques. The library is a renderer for Three, using it we can skip a lot of mundane work such as scene creation and concentrate on composing our components in a declarative way with props and states.</p><p>The renderer allows us to use all of the Three classes, objects and properties as elements in our markup. All classes constructors arguments can be accessed via an <code>args</code> prop. A simple mesh with a box class can be seen below. Don't worry if you don't understand what this means, we will go over everything shortly.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>mesh</span><span> </span><span>visible</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>rotation</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>boxGeometry</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>geometry</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>meshStandardMaterial</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>material</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>mesh</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>MDX</p><p>Our page will be rendered in <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a></span>, a format which allows us to write JSX and include React components in markdown files. It's a wonderful development experience and one I hope you will fall in love with once we reach the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Install the fun</p><p>I have created a handy snowpack template that creates a project with snowpack, chakra and MDX all installed. It also comes with React Router v6 but we wont be using that so will remove that boilerplate.</p><p>Open a new terminal and navigate to your desired project folder and run the following which will create our new project. Change <code>my-new-app</code> to your apps name.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npx create-snowpack-app my-new-app --template snowpack-mdx-chakra</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Next we can install our projects dependencies.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npm</span><span> i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-three-fiber three @react-three/drei react-particles-js</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Now that we have our dependencies installed we can begin to tear out some of the stuff we wont need. Our landing page will encompass a single page so we can open the <code>mdx-routes.js</code> file and remove the <code>Nav</code> component and the page-two route from the <code>MDXRoutes</code> component. We'll return to this file later to add some styling but for now we can move on.</p><p>Inside the pages folder delete page-two and remove the contents from page-one. Inside the components folder delete the emoji component and add a new folder called 3d. And that's it, we are now ready to begin coding some sick 3D landing page goodness!</p><p>The layout</p><p>Open the <code>mdx-layout.js</code> file located in the components folder. This will wrap our whole app, in our case our one landing page. Our page will consist of a css grid, we'll use grid areas to get a nice visual representation of how our page will layout. Remove what is currently in there and add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Flex</span><span>,</span><span> Grid </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> desktop </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>'edge   .       .         .'</span></p><p><span>'edge   text    product   .'</span></p><p><span></span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MDXLayout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Grid</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateColumns</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr 10%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateRows</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateAreas</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>desktop</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>bg</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.background</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100vh</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Grid</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> MDXLayout</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Using Chakras Grid component we set the amount of columns to have a responsive padding of 10% of the viewport width on each side of two flexible one fractional units of space. This basically means that the meat of our page will live in the two fractional columns, with each taking up as much space as they need before they hit the 10% padding on each side. Our rows follow the same logic except we save 10% for our header row and the rest takes up as much space as needed. As you can see, we have a background color set on the bg (background) prop. But where does that value come from and what does it mean?</p><p>Open the <code>theme.js</code> file located in the <code>src</code> folder. This is our global theme for our app. We are importing the default theme from Chakra, which itself uses the Tailwind default preset. We are then overriding the colors with our own brand colors. The font sizes are also being overridden to allow us to use slightly different sizes to the default. Go ahead and copy the following colors object into the file instead of the current one.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>colors: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>..</span><span>.theme.colors,</span></p><p><span>    brand: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      red: </span><span>'#ed1c24'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      lightGrey: </span><span>'#D6D6D6'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      background: </span><span>'#090d12'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      text: </span><span>'#FFFfff'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Components in MDX</p><p>MDX is just markdown that you can write JSX in. So that means that we can write normal markdown like so:</p><pre></pre><p>But we can also add to that React components We can even compose React components right in the MDX file! Let's open up the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and check out how we can add components to our MDX file without using imports.</p><p>Let's break down what's going on in here. If we scroll to the bottom we can see an <code>MDXProvider</code> wrapping our app. It accepts a components prop into which we have passed a components object declared above. The components object allows us to map React components to markdown elements as well as passing in custom components for use in our MDX files. As you can see, this template has set this all up for us by mapping some basic markdown elements to some Chakra components. Where there is no object key we have passed in a custom component which can be used in the MDX file without importing it as you would in a normal js or jsx file.</p><p>MDX accepts a special key called <code>wrapper</code> which will wrap the entire file with whatever is passed to it. In our case it will take our previously created layout component along with it's grid and use that to wrap our MDX file.

This component allows us to quickly apply flex box props to the base element, a div. Even though the component is based upon a div we can give it semantic meaning by utilizing the <code>as</code> props and setting it the header. If we check our layout file again and look at our grid areas we can see that we have <code>edge</code> on the first and second rows. So we have set the grid area to edge and the row to 1.</p><p>This places our component in the top left hand corner of the page. We have given it a margin-left (ml) so that it doesn't hit the edge.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SREs are responsible for evaluating tools that can help reduce toil on their teams and make their applications more reliable for end-users. There are a lot of SRE tools out there, and it can be hard to know which ones are the most important to consider. We’ve compiled this guide to highlight the key categories of SRE tools and help you find the right fit for your team.</p><h2>Monitoring tools</h2><p>Monitoring tools are used to generate valuable metrics and insights about an application and help SREs do everything from creating benchmarks to debugging outages. Luckily, there are monitoring tools for practically anything you might want to measure relating to your application. These tools usually cover one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Application performance monitoring (APM)</strong>: Models the response times perceived by end users of your application and compares this against performance benchmarks to detect latency and outages.</li><li><strong>Network monitoring</strong>: Examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic routed through your network to help with load balancing, debug client/server issues, and stop network attacks like DOS attacks before they occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resource / infrastructure monitoring: </strong>Looks at the consumption rates and SLOs for the components of your application, like the CPU load for your Kubernetes clusters, to help with resource management.</li></ul><h3>What to look for in a monitoring tool</h3><p>No matter what type of monitoring tool you’re looking at, you’ll want to investigate the following important features:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alerts: </strong>The tool should be able to generate alerts when metrics approach and exceed the thresholds that your SRE team identifies.</li><li><strong>Automated incident response: </strong>Ideally, your tools will also try to automatically fix any detected issues where possible, helping reduce your engineering overhead.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Logging: </strong>Your monitoring tool should create detailed logs that contain all the information you would need to debug an issue, with configurable highlighting for easier consumption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visualizations and dashboards: </strong>Monitoring tools offer various kinds of graphics and charts to help you interpret the data at a glance or communicate with your stakeholders. Depending on your use cases, you might want to look for tools that support certain types of data round-ups and visual representations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported integrations: </strong>Your tool should work seamlessly with your application components and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common monitoring tools</h3><p>Here are some of the monitoring tools that we hear about often from SREs:&nbsp;</p><h4>Open-source tools</h4><p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>: A popular monitoring tool with an active community and broad range of features.</p><p><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>: Helps you make dashboards and visualizations by integrating with other monitoring tools (often combined with Prometheus).&nbsp;</p><h4>Tools you can purchase</h4><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">AppDynamics</a>: A platform focusing on APM (though it also offers network and resource monitoring).</p><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">DataDog</a>: Offers a suite of monitoring tools to cover many different use cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&amp;utm_term=splunk&amp;_bk=splunk&amp;_bt=386199173970&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=43997962767&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgVfR2eqnx8gp6gDbtDTiPEVAcjJaAjRnT_mHhy8nUGRst6ycdQC_RBoCwmkQAvD_BwE">Splunk</a>: A generalized tool for managing large-scale data and deriving actionable insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>On-call management tools</h2><p>SREs and engineers are often responsible for being on call during working and non-working hours, prepared to react immediately to resolve any issue that might threaten the system’s health. Being on call can be stressful, and you want to be careful not to burn out your team. Fortunately, there are many tools SREs can use to help reduce the burden and make being on-call a bit less painful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an on-call management tool</h3><p>While most on-call tools also help your team manage the incident itself, we’ll be covering incident management in the next section. Here are some on-call rotation specific features to help you prioritize your assessment:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scheduling on-call rotations</strong>: Your tool should help you distribute the on-call duty equally and fairly across your team, with flexibility in case someone needs to trade on-call rotations at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sharing on-call calendars</strong>: Sometimes an issue touches multiple components, and several on-call engineers need to be involved in the incident response. For that reason, it’s important that your tool provides a centralized way to view the on-call calendars across your organization.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alerting on-call engineers: </strong>This one is pretty obvious, but it’s absolutely essential. Your on-call tool needs to integrate with your monitoring tools to deliver alerts, and it must provide a payload with enough context so that the on-call engineer can address the issue. Your tool should also give you rules-based configurations for alert routing and controls to combat spammy alerts, which lead to burnout.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common tools for on-call management</h3><p>Popular on-call management tools include <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Splunk OnCall</a> (formerly VictorOps), and Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Opsgenie</a>.</p><h2>Incident management tools</h2><p>Inevitably, failures will occur in your system, and the person on-call is going to need powerful tools to help fix issues in the moment and make sure that they don’t happen again. According to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/" target="_blank">Google’s SRE Book</a>, managing an incident successfully comes down to three things: (1) clear escalation paths, (2) well-defined response procedures, and (3) a blameless post-mortem culture. SREs can find tools to codify these practices and help your team communicate better and resolve incidents faster.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an incident management tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Issue triage: </strong>Your tool should help you configure issue types and severity levels so that you know how to prioritize and when to escalate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Escalation pathways: </strong>Whether issues are manually or automatically escalated, you should be able to quickly get the right people involved and easily share all of the context they need to understand the issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Runbooks / workflows: </strong>Depending on the issue classification, your tool should hand over the runbook of predefined steps the on-call engineers need to follow. Your tool should also be able to automatically execute workflows if certain conditions are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Real-time communication: </strong>Your tool should integrate with the apps your team uses to communicate, like Slack, Jira, or even Zoom, to share information automatically and free you up to focus on the issue at hand. It should also create a historical document of the incident response that your team can refer to later on.</li><li><strong>Data-driven issue analysis: </strong>Ideally, your tool will give you all the data you need to understand what happened and focus on how it can be avoided next time, instead of placing blame on individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common incident management tools</h3><p>All of the on-call management tools previously mentioned also feature some form of incident management. Additional dedicated tools for this purpose include <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">Blameless</a>, <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a>, and Netflix’s open source crisis management tool, <a href="http://blameless.com/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Configuration/Automation tools</h2><p>A main function of the SRE role is to automate away the mindless and busywork tasks of software development. Automated configurations can be used to ensure that toil is reduced and the same steps are always repeated when provisioning, managing, and destroying resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an configuration tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Infrastructure as code: </strong>This paradigm means that your infrastructure specifications live in a file, which can be run to recreate your configuration in the event of an outage. Most automation tools will have their own language for declaring the desired configuration.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Execution planning: </strong>Your tool should offer a preview of the effects of your changes before you run the automation, to make sure there are no unanticipated consequences.</li><li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> The tool should allow you to enforce steps that are always followed when performing a task, like deploying an application, and let you run these workflows automatically.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supports container orchestration: </strong>If you use a container orchestration service like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy your services, your configuration tool should be compatible.</li></ul><h3>Common configuration tools</h3><p>Popular tools for automating your infrastructure configurations are <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Microservice catalog tools</h2><p>To make sure that incidents are avoided in the first place, SRE teams should look for tools that help them enforce high-level policies and best practices. A key tenet of microservice catalog tools should be governance over your service oriented architecture. Governance refers to <em>what </em>rules and processes the team follows, as well as <em>who </em>is responsible for reliability across different services and applications. This helps avoid tribal knowledge, and is especially important when teams work remotely and manage many different microservices.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in a microservice catalog tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Supports a production readiness review (PRR): </strong>A key process for SREs is a PRR: stepping through a predefined checklist to make sure that the software is ready to deploy. This might include things like ensuring that you’ve set up load balancing and end-to-end testing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Transparent ownership: </strong>This tool should create a catalog of services with their owners clearly identified, so it’s easy to look up who is responsible for what.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Integrates with your </strong><a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/list/integrations" target="_blank"><strong>existing tools</strong></a><strong>: </strong>All the best practices you’re trying to enforce should be visible within one tool. This means, for example, that your APM set-up and on-call rotations should appear alongside the catalog of your services, so you don’t have to refer to multiple tools to know where to find important data.</li><li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>When your configurations or policies change, you shouldn’t need to make manual edits in the tool.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common microservice catalog tools</h3><p>The most common governance tool we’ve seen is unfortunately a giant spreadsheet (or, worse, several spreadsheets!). Since this is the opposite of the SRE philosophy, we’ve created Cortex to fill the gap. Our <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5f727be73405af82f83b0972_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-28%20at%205.01.49%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>microservice catalog</strong></a><strong> </strong>makes it easy to see your services and owners in one place, and we foster accountability and show you how to improve using a gamified <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5ecc28b2e9133b2ab44992a2_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-25%20at%201.20.53%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>scorecard</strong></a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the right tools, your SRE team will be able to spend their energies improving your product’s reliability and performance instead of dealing with toil and overhead. We hope this …</p></div></div>

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>

<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The main processor is an Intel 8080.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The side view of the terminal:</p>

<p>You can immediately recognize the VT100 on the manual cover:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png" alt="Digital VT100 - technical manual" width="312" height="431" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual.png 624w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-300x414.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-technical_manual-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px"></a></p>
<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<p><span>Y</span>esterday, I got into a verbal altercation at Starbucks.</p>
<p><span>An older man, talking very loudly, said something along the lines of “My son is golden because he has a degree from Stanford University.”</span></p>
<p><span>This comment really infuriated me because this type of outdated thinking—that a college degree from an elite, pricey university means you’re set for life—must die immediately. It falsely </span><b>signals</b><span> to employers that you’re better than the average Jane just because you have a piece of paper. In reality,</span><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <span>all it really signals is your family’s socioeconomic status</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>So I interjected and said, “Let me guess… You paid for your son’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I did,” he said. “My son’s grandfather was Herbert Hoover, and my son’s degree is like gold.”</span></p>
<p><span>[Eye roll]</span></p>
<p><span>I preceded to tell him that it doesn’t matter if you have a college degree anymore to do today’s jobs and that he was basically bragging about his family’s socioeconomic status, not his son’s actual achievements. I tried to elaborate about the inequalities of higher education and why it’s an outdated metric of future success. I explained why employers are absolutely wrong for thinking his son is better than someone without a degree or a degree from a public university.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he told me to go fly a kite, because that’s usually what happens when people are wrong and have zero evidence that their stance is right and yours is wrong. (I’m always open to new ideas, SO LONG AS you present trustworthy facts, stats, and research.)</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, this man is an out-of-touch elitist, and I stand by everything I said to him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/stanford-university"><b>Fun fact</b></a><b>: The median family income of a student from Stanford is $167,500, and 66% come from the top 20%.

<h2><span id="Degree_requirements_lead_to_less_diversity"></span><b>Degree requirements lead to less diversity</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Recruiters use software, known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which I discuss in detail in a </span><a href="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/"><span>previous article</span></a><span>. ATS collect, sort, and filter job applicants who apply through an online form.</span></p>
<p><span>They use this tool because the average job post receives 250 applications today, and they need a way to save time filtering down candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, online application forms will feature “knockout questions,” like “Where did you graduate from?” “What year did you graduate?” and “What did you major in?” These are meant to automatically weed out candidates who don’t meet certain criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, if I—a college dropout—were to apply to a job with these knockout questions, I’d automatically be filtered to the rejection pile, with not one human actually taking the time to even scan my resume. All because I don’t have a Bachelor’s degree, despite my 10 years of professional, proven experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if application forms don’t feature knockout questions, recruiters are likely inputting “keywords” into their ATS, searching for words like, “Bachelor’s,” “Harvard,” etc., just to quickly filter down the amount of resumes they have to review.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me be clear: Filtering candidates by degree is the epitome of wrong and legally,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>it’s actually discriminatory</span></a><span>, which could be a massive liability for companies requiring a Bachelor’s degree or higher to even be considered for employment.</span></p>
<p><span>This sounds like crazy fake news, but according to an article on the reputable legal encyclopedia,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>NOLO</span></a><span>, I’m right.</span></p>
<p><span>In the post, a reader asks if requiring a college degree for employment is illegal:</span></p>
<div>
<p><b>I work for a large nonprofit employer whose mission is to help inner-city children finish high school and go on to college.</b></p>
<p><span>We do fundraising, provide tutors and coaches, work with teachers and parents, and help school districts come up with strategies and resources to reduce dropout rates, among many other things. Our employees do everything from sending out mailings and answering phones to lobbying Congress to helping kids with their math homework and college applications.*</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the Board decided to require all new employees to have a college degree. </span><b>The Board feels that it would be great for the kids and their families we work with to see the benefits of staying in school; the Board has also said that having employees who never finished high school or college runs counter to the message we’re trying to send about the importance of education.</b></p>
<p><span>I can see their point, but I’m concerned that this requirement might screen out large numbers of applicants of color. Is it legal for us to adopt this hiring requirement?*</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>*Side-note:</b><span> Why are so many entities STILL preaching college as the only way to get a job and succeed in life, when 50% of grads are underemployed or unemployed today? See chart below.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/what-happened-to-the-promise-of-a-4-year-college-degree.aspx"><b><img title="06 credentialism more grads higher unemployment" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-1024x829.png" alt="Chart: As more people enroll in college, the unemployment rate among new college graduates has risen." width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-1024x829.png 1024w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-300x243.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-768x622.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment-770x623.png 770w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/06-credentialism-more-grads-higher-unemployment.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></b></a></p>
<p><b>NOLO’s answer:</b></p>
<div>
<p><span>Whether or not a hiring requirement is discriminatory depends on its intent and its effect. Some employers adopt screening tests or criteria with the purpose of screening out certain applicants. For example, imposing a strength test would have the effect of screening out larger numbers of women. If an employer’s intent is to discriminate, and its hiring criteria are simply a smokescreen for this true purpose, then the employer is discriminating. </span><b>But even if an employer has no intent to discriminate, its hiring criteria may have that effect.</b><span> If a selection test or requirement has a disproportionate effect on applicants in a particular protected category, that might be illegal discrimination. </span><b>The key is whether the requirement is truly necessary to do the job.</b><span> For example, a strength test might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants, but might also be necessary for a job as a firefighter, construction worker, or logger.</span></p>
<p><b>An employer whose screening test or requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</b><span> This is intended to be a difficult hurdle, but not an impossible one. For example, an attorney needs to pass the bar exam to practice law, so requiring applicants for an associate position at a law firm to be admitted to the bar would meet this test. Similarly, </span><b>many skills tests</b><span> would pass legal muster, as long as the exam tested skills that truly were necessary to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements are more slippery, in part because it isn’t clear exactly what particular skills, aptitudes, or abilities a degree confers</b><span> (unless a particular degree is required for licensing, like a law degree or medical degree generally is). </span><b>And, degree requirements often do have a disparate impact against African American and Latino applicants.</b></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Your Board has expressed a nondiscriminatory reason for its new requirement. </span><b>But a court would look at whether it really is necessary to have a college degree to do every job at your company.</b> <b>The variety of jobs employees hold is going to be a major strike against the requirement: It seems pretty evident that someone can stuff envelopes, answer phones, manage databases, and do a wide variety of other work without a college degree.</b></p>
<p><span>And, </span><b>even if a court were to accept the employer’s “role model” argument for certain positions, an applicant could still win a discrimination lawsuit by showing that there are less discriminatory alternatives available.</b><span> For example, an employee might be an even more effective advocate for staying in school if he or she can share how difficult it has been to succeed without a degree. An employee who has dropped out might be better able to relate to the decisions facing at-risk kids and better able to help them make a different choice. </span><b>In short, if a degree requirement has the effect of screening out larger numbers of African American and Latino applicants, your employer will face a very difficult task in trying to justify the disparity.</b></p>
</div>
<p><span>That last sentence is key. Today, the hot topic in HR today is “diversity.” Diversity for women, for latinos, for African-Americans, etc. But these are actually vanity metrics at best (or total lies at worst) if the company requires a college degree for employment—whether or not they realize it.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements actually lead to less diversity.</b></p>
<p><b>The strongest predictor of entrance and completion of a degree at a top-tier university isn’t merit, but</b><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <b>family ability to pay</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<p><a href="http://pellinstitute.org/downloads/publications-Indicators_of_Higher_Education_Equity_in_the_US_2020_Historical_Trend_Report.pdf"><span><img title="07 credentialism bachelors degree attainment family income" src="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income.png" alt="Graph: Estimated bachelor's degree attainment by age 24 for dependent family members by family income quartile: 1970 to 2018" width="1200" height="990" srcset="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income.png 1200w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-300x248.png 300w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-1024x845.png 1024w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-768x634.png 768w, https://www.thevectorimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/07-credentialism-bachelors-degree-attainment-family-income-770x635.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></a></p>
<p><span>So all your degree requirement really says to candidates is, “I discriminate based on your parents’ socioeconomic status.”</span></p>

			<p><strong>[INTERVIEW]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[00:01:31] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Hello, everybody. Thanks for tuning back in to The Secure Developer. Today, we’re going to have a DevOps-flavored episode here. I’m really happy to have with us James Turnbull, who is a VP of Engineering at Timber and also kind of a long time DevOps thought leader. He has been the chair of Velocity, has sort of been very much a core part of the DevOps journey, making him especially qualified to discuss a little bit about how it’s similar or different to the DevSecOps journey. James, thanks for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:01] James Turnbull:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:02] Guy Podjarny:</strong> James, before we dig into the topic of substance, tell us a little bit about what is it that you do and maybe your journey and how we touch security?</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:10] James Turnbull:</strong> Sure. I lead engineering product teams. At the moment, I’m working a product called Vector, which is an open source observability tool. I’ve been an engineer for about 25 years. I think it’s too many years to start citing that, and I started my career off largely in sort of enterprise, banking finance, as a security engineer and a security architect for a few years in a retail bank, I built perimeter systems and ATM networks and stuff like that. In the last 10 years or so, I’ve largely worked in high-growth startups. I was an early employee at Puppet, configuration management tool. I was an early employee at Docker obviously doing containerization. I was a CTO at Kickstarter and I have done similar sorts of roles over the last few years. As you said, I was the chair of the Velocity conference for a couple years and also I write technology books. I’ve written 11 books about engineering and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:00] Guy Podjarny:</strong> 11 books is impressive. I have a few under my belt but 11 books is definitely a notable number there.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:06] James Turnbull:</strong> No kids I think is probably an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:08] Guy Podjarny:</strong> It makes for some free time. So, I’m curious a little bit. Quite a few guests that came onto the show have gone into security from maybe the operations, and you actually were in security but then you moved outwards. Do you remember that transition, that decision point of whether you want to leave security and go to a role that doesn’t have security in the title?</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:29] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I was managing a CERT team, a Computer Emergency Response Team, at a retail bank, and one of the things I’ve been thinking about last three or four years before that was sort of large scale infrastructure management. One of the very frustrating things about being a security person in a large organization is you don’t control the infrastructure. You are largely dependent on infrastructure teams to provide you with information about vulnerabilities, about the state of the infrastructure. You’re largely reliant on them to do remediation for you. They would obviously come to me and say, “We don’t have any tools that allow us to mass maintain, mass patch all of these systems. We don’t use large-scale package management. We don’t have any configuration management tools.”</p>
<p>I sort of started to look in that area, about the same time I found Puppet. I started working on the open source Puppet tool. When they raised some money, I thought I can see the viability of this tool. I work in the environments where this is a desperate need. So, I came on board at Puppet to try and bring some of that experience, and I think I was probably our first pre-sales person, as well as being head of community and professional services, and a bunch of other things along the way. I tried to inject that flavor of this is what a large enterprise looks like. This is their experience. This is the empathy I have for their problems. The very first customer, I was involved in the New York Stock Exchange, customers that sort of flavor where my experience resonated.</p>
<p><strong>[00:04:47] Guy Podjarny:</strong> That’s a great story, and it’s interesting around this, taking ownership basically or being frustrated about not being able to control and address those issues. You very much scratched your own itch with the move to the solution itself in the world of Puppet. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>It’s actually interesting that Puppet, I think, recently, maybe in the last couple of years, have actually launched a remediation-focused solution that indeed focuses. It sounds maybe like on the same problem space that you’ve just been describing as [inaudible 00:05:15].</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:15] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I’ve had a couple of steps at it. [inaudible 00:05:17] was a product manager there for a while, originally built a sort of patch management, vulnerability management system like 2012 or 2013 but it proved to be – It’s a non-trivial problem to solve. But, yes, it’s definitely one of those areas where we have a lot of information about vulnerabilities. We have a lot more ability to interrogate hosts and work out what’s wrong. We still have the challenge of how do you remediate those in a safe and reliable way? How do you ensure that there’s no downtime?</p>
<p>I think those problems are the ones that Puppet is trying to work out, how do we solve? How do we take these feeds of data and turn them into actions or execution that organizations can undertake?</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:55] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah, very much. I mean, there’s also been some surrounding changes with the adoption of Kubernetes, as you pointed out, the ability to interrogate environments and ask for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s indeed maybe go down this path of the DevOps analogy and maybe a reverse path of your journey and talk a little bit about the analogies in the DevOps journey and in these changes of tools. Where is it that we can learn from them in security versus where do they defer and should be defined differently?</p>
<p>I thought maybe a helpful model for us to try and follow here is this people process technology type trial. Let’s start from that first one there, people. Maybe I’ll start by having you describe because people have different definitions of the people aspect of DevOps. When you think about people change is required to do DevOps successfully, how do you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:45] James Turnbull:</strong> I mean, I think the people aspect of DevOps to me is probably the most important aspect of it. My best interactions or my best successes in building things or working on things or operating things was because I had good relationships with the folks all part of the process, whether they be software engineers, DBAs, or security people, or audit risk people. It’s a relationship-driven process.</p>
<p>To me, the DevOps thing is really about building a bridge between folks who previously perhaps didn’t have a conversation. There wasn’t necessarily any antagonism there. It was literally like, I do a job. I build an artifact. I give that artifact to some other people. Those other people do something with it, and sometimes they come and tell me that it’s broken.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there’s a little bit of friction in there with regards to like the op side of things, get other people that live with the outage and so forth, but it’s really about like, okay, the Ops people have a set of expectations and constraints, and they have some needs. If they had a conversation with the people building the thing in the first place at first principles, would some of that process be smoother? Would the friction be reduced? Would the potential for outages be reduced?</p>
<p>To me, having a conversation, having a good relationship, understanding everybody’s needs is the key to that sort of DevOps thing. Obviously, there’s lots of tools and those bits and pieces in that automate a number of those processes and sort of reduce the human effort requirement, but it all stems from having that conversation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:12] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah. I very much relate to this but I guess maybe let me ask you, from a security change perspective. Now, when you think, okay, we’re going to do DevSecOps, and I’m using this buzzword fairly loosely over here, it’s just a simple way of saying embed security into the DevOps existence if you will, or processes, do you see the same? Do you also think really the most important piece is the people piece?</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:35] James Turnbull:</strong> I think so. I think there’s a couple of levels of this. When I started out in security, there was a generation or even a couple of generations before me who saw their role as saying no to things. They really saw themselves as guardians of the business and the enterprise. The easiest way to safeguard those organizations was to say, “No, we shouldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>I probably belong to the next generation that came along. I left security about the same time as this was becoming more sort of status quo, but a bunch of people who really said that our job is not to say no. Our job is to say present the risk, present options about how you might mediate the risk in some way, with a view to like allowing the business to do what it needs to do to make money in a fast and efficient and safest way possible. It’s their risk appetite and not our risk appetite. Our job is to explain to them the decisions they’re making and what the impact is, but it’s really their ownership. They own the business risk in a way that we don’t.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonates really strongly with me in this sort of DevOps sort of the world is ultimately the outcome is you want to move fast and ship things, right? You want to be able to take the time from code, not earning you any money on a developer’s desktop, to code running in production, and making your business money. One of the sort of caveats in there, one of the things in there, is you want to do that in a secure way, as well as an efficient set of ways. Security becomes another stakeholder in that DevOps life cycle, and their job is really to say, “Okay. We have policy or we have process, or we have information we need from you that bubbles up and allows us to do our jobs. If we give you that …</p></div></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLf9q36UsBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
        <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, February  1, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>It seems like everyone these days is developing in containers. Specifically, I mean running your local development environment almost entirely in containers. There's a lot to be said for it, especially when you're bringing new developers into a project: it can be an invaluable way for anyone new to the project to quickly get all the tooling set up with a lot fewer "works on my machine" issues. But everything involves tradeoffs, so today we're going to focus on what some of the drawbacks of containers are. Also because it's my blog, so I write about what I want, dammit, and containers have been bugging me a little lately!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have been bugging me, and that make me just want to run processes directly on my host.</p>
<p><strong>Installing and managing packages takes extra work.</strong> Using Python as an example, it's pretty easy to get packages installed for any project that's using a modern dependency manager like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>. You just run something like <code>poetry install</code> and it will setup a virtualenv for you (essential to have reproducible builds, isolated between projects). The tool is there, and you just use it, but you can wrap it in a Makefile for convenience if you like. But if you're using Docker, you get a lot of extra steps. For one, you have to make sure that the dependency manager's generated virtualenv is persisted on your host, not just in the container, else you will be reinstalling those dependencies every time you start a container. (Or you can install the dependencies into the <em>image</em>, but then you have to rebuild the entire image and install <em>every</em> dependency to just add one for testing something out, adding unnecessary friction.)</p>
<p><strong>Actually, everything takes extra commands.</strong> You want to install a new package? Oh, open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to compile your program? Open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to launch the development server? You guessed it... And yes, I know the pedantic comments are going to be "well, actually you can do this in one command with <code>docker run</code>"—okay, but that's not better: now you've just made the one command you need to run <em>far</em> longer.</p>
<p><strong>File permissions are a pain in the butt.</strong> If you have a directory mounted on the host and in the container (<code>node_modules</code>, for example) then in all likelihood the files created inside the container are going to be owned by <code>root</code> since everything runs as <code>root</code> by default. When you're your normal user outside the container, you now will have challenges doing things like deleting that directory—and it produces a lot of really noisy output when you use something like <code>grep</code>, because suddenly there are a lot of files you cannot read! There are solutions to this, making the container use the same userid as your user on the system, but I have not found anything that worked well. It's just not worth the effort, and you're left with a nuisance every time you generate files inside a container.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining history is difficult.</strong> Getting your bash history retained between containers is a challenge, but I understand it's doable. Now you use a Python shell, so you need to configure that one for history as well.  Then you start using Elixir, so you need to configure history for it as well. Everything that normally works out of the box when you're developing on your host directly? You have to configure it and figure out which files you need to share between containers and the host to make it work. You usually figure this out by the pain of <em>not</em> having the history, and eventually someone on the team will patch it to make it work (mostly). But... at what cost? You get this for free by just, you know, using the host.</p>
<p><strong>Performance is horrible on Macs.</strong> I use Linux as my only operating system (Ubuntu specifically), but many colleagues past and present prefer using Macs. With the latest hardware advances from Apple, this is going to hold true going forward. And yet the performance is tangibly worse for Docker on Macs, because you have to run it inside a VM. (Windows cleverly skirts this problem by running the Linux kernel directly, not inside a VM; Mac OS could certainly take a similar approach in the future, if they prioritize developer experience. I am not optimistic.)</p>
<p><strong>Integration with tooling isn't great.</strong> We've had a tough time at <a href="https://remesh.ai/">work</a> getting IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code to play nice with our containerized setup. They support containers, but they don't seem to support containerized monorepos very well. Or that's what I've seen from the problems my colleagues have run into. I've fiddled with it a bit. As a vim user, it doesn't affect me personally, but it is a big issue when considering the impact on the team at large.</p>
<p>So, yeah, containers are pretty great. I'm glad we have them, and I <em>love</em> having them for use in production environments. But locally? Most of the time, I think you're better off running what you're developing directly on your local machine. You get a robust, easy-to-use setup that doesn't throw away a lot of the features you get for free (history!). There are benefits to either approach, but the old tried-and-true methods deserve some love.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
			<div>
<p>They called him the Black Sparrow, and from the beginning of his life, all he wanted to do was get to France.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He was born in Georgia, his father a former slave from Haiti, his mother full-blooded Creek. He ran away while still a child, determined to fulfill his destiny.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He lived for a time with a group of English Romani, learning the art of horsemanship and working as a jockey. He kept traveling and working until he made his way to Norfolk, where he stowed away on a ship bound for Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He wouldn’t see America again for thirty years.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In Glasgow he got work as a lookout for gambling operators, saving money until he had enough to get to England: one country closer to his goal. In Liverpool he did hard labor until his muscles developed and he turned to boxing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He became part of a whole expat community of Black boxers — some of the finest fighters in history — who had fled to Europe to find opportunities denied them in the States. Soon he was fighting regularly as a welterweight, racking up an impressive record, even fighting on the undercard of a few Jack Johnson bouts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>His boxing career earned him a decent amount of money, and eventually took him to Paris, where he won his bout and promptly hopped off the tour.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Imagine, if you will, being a young, handsome Black/Creek man, son of a slave, escaped from the American South, newly arrived in Paris in the springtime with your own apartment and a pocketful of money.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Fighting for France was a no-brainer. After all, in his heart at least, it was his country. He joined the French Foreign Legion, training to fight in the 3rd Marching Division alongside wealthy Ivy Leaguers, mariners, farmers, doctors, executives, refugees, cooks, and plenty of characters from all over the world running from undisclosed situations. These were Belgians, Italians, Russians, Greeks, Americans, a handful of Black Americans; Muslims, Catholics, Jews and Protestants — the legendary rabble of the Legion.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Sent directly to the front along the Somme, he was thrust into a world of filthy, bloody trenches still filled with the body parts of the dead and the rancid smell of shit and blood as his unit experienced some of the worst losses of the war.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the end of this stint, what was left of the 3rd was disbanded and he had only the briefest respite before he joined the 170th Cavalry and was sent straight to Verdun to participate in what would become one of the worst battles in the history of the human race.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now a corporal, he led a machine-gun crew and again was front-and-center for the worst of the fighting, suffering first a shrapnel wound to the face that he simply fought through, then finally sidelined by a massive, nearly fatal wound to his thigh that finally sent him away from the front.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Decorated with the Croix de Guerre for his valor at Verdun — one of France’s highest military honors — he was well within his rights to find a desk job in the military.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He had other ideas. He wanted to fly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Already viewed as a hero, he was able to pull the necessary strings to enter flight school, and became the first Black American fighter pilot in history.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew a SPAD VII C1 with a distinctive alteration to its appearance. Painted on the outside of the fuselage was a red heart with a dagger through it. Above the heart was his personal slogan, one he would later use for the title of his unpublished memoir: Tout Le Sang Qui Coule Est Rouge; roughly, in English: “All Blood Runs Red.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew with honor and distinction until his career in the air came to an abrupt halt. The Americans had entered the war and the involvement of a certain Dr. Gros, a US Army Major with racist attitudes, led to the end of the Black Sparrow’s career as a pilot.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But the French continued to celebrate him. He ended this part of his military career with the Military Medal, Croix de Guerre, Volunteer Combat Cross, Medal for Military Wounded (twice), World War I Medal, Victory Medal, Voluntary Enlistment Medal, Battle of Verdun Medal, Battle of Somme Medal, and the American Volunteer with the French Army Medal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And that is when his life got interesting.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The Great War over, he found himself in Paris in the 1920s at the onset of the Jazz Age. He got back in shape, took work as a sparring partner and fought a few more times. But it wasn’t sustainable with his injuries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So he learned to play the drums and became a jazz musician. He gigged frequently, saved money, and ended up in a business partnership with a biracial American blues singer whose birth name was Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louis Virginia Smith — known as “Bricktop” for her red hair.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Together, they opened the Le Grand Duc, and thus he became proprietor of the hippest nightclub in the hippest city during the birth of hip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He got married around this time to a Frenchwoman named Marcelle and they had two daughters. For reasons that remained private, Marcelle ended up leaving him with their children, to whom he would remain devoted for the rest of his life, as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But he had to balance the duties of being a single parent with Le Grand Duc — and later his other club, L’escradille, which was connected to a boxing gym so that patrons could party, then exercise, take a steam bath, get a massage, and start partying again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To name the personages that frequented his clubs is basically to list the greatest names in art and culture in the renaissance that was the 1920s.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Langston Hughes was a busboy and dishwasher. Arthur Wilson — you may know him as “Sam” of Casablanca fame — was part of the house band. Charlie Chaplin was a favorite. Gloria Swanson. Fatty Arbuckle. The Prince of Wales. Staff would move tables when Fred and Adele Astaire came in to tear up the floor. Picasso would stop by, and Hemingway was there often enough that he wrote about it in “The Sun Also Rises.” Josephine Baker could not be missed, and even babysat for the Sparrow. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda were frequent, notorious guests. Cole Porter would come in; he adored the way Bricktop interpreted his songs. When Louis Armstrong encamped in Paris, he and the Sparrow became close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But the good times couldn’t last. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. In France, the Deuxième Bureau was created as a counter-intelligence service and the Sparrow was recruited to work with the beautiful Alsatian spy, Cleopatre “Kitty” Terrier, whose father’s murder by Germans in the disputed border region had instilled in her a lifelong hatred of German expansionism.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Kitty and the Sparrow worked as a team at the club. He would serve tables and play dumb, exploiting German prejudices that would never suspect he was fluent in German. She would flirt her way into privileged information. It was a highly successful (and probably romantic) pairing, but with rationing, blackouts, and other wartime austerity measures, keeping businesses running became harder and harder.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He tried. He procured a wagon and would visit markets at the end of the day for discounted goods, throw them in a stew at the club. Come evening he would feed everyone for free, plus a free glass of wine per person and a pack of cigarettes per table. He tried. But of course, things got worse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He pulled his daughters out of their convent school to keep them close. Closed the club. Many were fleeing as the Nazis came storming through Belgium. He wouldn’t run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He continued to work with Kitty in the Resistance until 1940, when the Nazis marched down Champs-Élysées and through L’arc de Triomphe.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tens of thousands fled the city only to be bombed from the skies. He left his daughters in the care of Kitty, who promised to do what was necessary to keep them safe, packed his gear, and headed for the frontlines, determined, despite his age and multiple injuries, to find his old unit and rejoin the Legion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he arrived, it was only to find that his unit had been destroyed. Returning to Paris, he couldn’t enter; it had been completely overrun.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But he heard rumors that the French 51st was holding out at Orléans. He started off on foot. The roads were full of starved, half-mad refugees. Bombings were frequent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he got there he discovered that his lieutenant from the last war was the commander of the 51st, and, in what must have felt like the world’s worst case of déjà vu, he was once again in charge of a machine-gun crew, fighting the Germans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He fought with his usual bravery. But it was a hopeless last stand. A shell that killed 11 men threw him forty feet and cracked a vertebrae.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>His fighting days were over. Using his rifle as a crutch, he struck out for a military hospital in Angoulême, trying to stay out of sight.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But there was little they could do for him there: painkillers, some bandages, and a few cans of sardines with a suggestion to head for Bordeaux and into Spain which, although Fascist, had maintained official neutrality, and was tacitly allowing Allied rescue efforts on Spanish soil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He made it, somehow, received his first passport, and was put on a Navy ship to finally return to the United States he had fled decades before.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Life in Manhattan wasn’t easy. He had to start from scratch. He worked odd jobs — longshoreman, salesman of French perfume. Through a contact in the State Department he was able to get in touch with Kitty, who was true to her word: his daughters were safe. They came to the States without a word of English between them and moved in with their beloved father in Spanish Harlem.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He became involved in Free French groups, working to support General de Gaulle, head of the Free French government in exile, and was also filmed getting beaten by police as part of a human chain to protect Paul Robeson when his concert was disrupted by white supremacists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Times were tight but he was doing okay. His old friend Louis Armstrong came to help, hiring him as a tour manager and occasional drummer. He even tried to recover his club and gym in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-03">Marc on 2021-02-03</h2>

<p>I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. </p>

<p>RSS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Really-Simple-Syndication</a>, is (or <em>was</em> depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.</p>

<p>Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the <em>curated</em> timeline). I've already spoken before about my <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html">general disinterest with Social Media</a> but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p>

<p>However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html">Deep Work</a> as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the <em>latest</em> items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…</p>

<p>Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.</p>

<p>As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss">Reddit still offers RSS support</a> by appending <code>/.rss</code> to the end of a given URL.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.</p>

<p>Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding <a href="https://atthis.link/rss.xml">this blog</a> to your reader?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>February 03, 2021</p></header><section><p>The security of Machine Learning models is a consideration that we often omit to study thoroughly when we are designing Machine Learning Systems. Yet, it presents a risk that is growing with the increase of AI adoption rate.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll go over the main concepts to understand this subject:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> do we need to care about the security of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> are the vulnerabilities of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> can we secure ML Systems ?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why should we care ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning models are more and more integrated in sensitive decision-making systems such as autonomous vehicles, health diagnosis, credit scoring, recruitment, etc. Some models can be trained on personal data like private emails, photos and messages from social media.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are complex software components and can be compromised. Vulnerable systems can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> the exposure of sensitive information or specific details included in the data used for training the models.</li>
<li><strong>Model extraction:</strong> copying a model by stealing the internal parameters and hyperparameters.</li>
<li><strong>Model tricking:</strong> fooling the model by manipulating the inputs, leading to erroneous decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Model corruption:</strong> methods that perturb the inner functioning of the model to generate corrupted outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the threats ?</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some vulnerabilities from which ML models suffer, this is a non-exhaustive list:</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<h3>Data extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unintended Memorization</strong></p>
<p>Deep learning models and in particular generative models suffer from unintended memorization<sup>1</sup>, they can memorize rare details from the training data. Using only inferences from the model, it is possible to extract sensitive information from the training dataset.</p>
<p>This method was used to extract credit card details and social security numbers from Gmail’s Smart Compose feature that helps you to write emails faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership Inference</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique an attacker can infer whether a new data record is included in the training dataset or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Stealing</strong></p>
<p>Using these methods and by querying models (with predictions APIs), it is possible to extract an equivalent ML model. These attacks are successful against a wide variety of model types: logistic regressions, decision trees, SVMs and deep neural networks.</p>
<p>A set of model extraction attacks were used to steal model types and parameters from public machine learning services such as BigML and Amazon Machine Learning in 2016 <sup>2</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model tricking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial attacks</strong></p>
<p>Adversarial attack is maybe one of the most known attacks on deep neural networks since it has been widely mediatized. It works by providing deceptive input at inference time. It’s a powerful method because the noise added to the input can be imperceptible and it does not depend on the architecture of the attacked model.</p>
<p>In the following example <sup>3</sup>, the model is tricked to classify the image as “guacamole”.</p>
<p><span>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="Adversarial attack: cat recognized as guacamole" title="Adversarial attack: cat recognized as guacamole" src="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/6ff00954ad40f99317218a80acca1c28/fcda8/adversarial.png" srcset="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/6ff00954ad40f99317218a80acca1c28/12f09/adversarial.png 148w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>Training data often include information harvested by automated scrapers or from unverified sources on the web, this is a vulnerability that can be exploited to tamper with models.</p>
<p>For example, data poisoning was used to generate undetectable spam messages <sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor attacks</strong></p>
<p>These methods work by injecting a trojan in the training data or in a pre-trained model that is activated by a trigger at inference time to make the model output a specific result. It is model-agnostic.</p>
<p>In this example the trigger is a small square patch or sticker that is used to flip the identification of the stop sign <sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/04c57/backdoor.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="Backdoor attack: green square patch on stop sign" title="Backdoor attack: green square patch on stop sign" src="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/04c57/backdoor.png" srcset="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/12f09/backdoor.png 148w,
https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/04c57/backdoor.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px" loading="lazy">
  </a>
    </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attacks on Transfer Learning</strong></p>
<p>If a pre-trained model is corrupted with data poisoning or a backdoor attack, it is likely that a new model that is trained using the corrupted model as a starting point will be corrupted as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federated Learning</strong>, considering its distributed nature, can be even more exposed to Model corruption through training data manipulation as we can assume that an ML hacker has a full control of part of the training samples and labels. Federated learning can also be subject to data extraction attacks through the leakage of gradients shared between the workers and/or the server <sup>6</sup>.</p>
<h2>How can we secure models ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning security is an active research area, and since we are dealing with computer systems we cannot have a 100% secure system. Some of the defense mechanisms that exist are only experimentally validated, so we have to be aware that they can be broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Differential Privacy can be used against data extraction attacks. The aim of this technique, applied during the training of the model, is to approach similar outputs when the training is done with the sensitive data or without it. It tries to ensures that the model does not rely too much on individual samples <sup>1</sup>. In practice, that comes at the expense of accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong></p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption is an encryption method that enables computations on encrypted data directly. It ensures that the decrypted result is the same as if the computation had been done on unencrypted inputs. In a simplified way, for an encryption function <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{E}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>It is one of the defense mechanisms used in Federated learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomization methods</strong></p>
<p>The goal of these techniques is to protect Deep Neural Networks models against perturbations by adding randomness to test points and using the fact that Deep Neural Networks are robust to random perturbations. A random input transformation can help mitigate adversarial effects. Random smoothing technique is used to perturb backdoor attack triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Preprocessing</strong></p>
<p>Input preprocessing can be used against backdoor attacks or adversarial attacks, by modifying the model input during training or testing. Autoencoders can be used to clean the input. An imperfect reconstruction can make the model unable to recognize triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial training</strong></p>
<p>In this method, we train the model by adding adversarial samples in the training data to improve its robustness against adversarial attacks <sup>8</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Machine Learning systems are complex software systems where software code and data are interlaced, so they do not only face computer security risks but also data threats. Data Scientists and ML Engineers need to be aware of these risks when they design their Machine Learning systems.</p>

<p>Calculating prime numbers in a range is another comparison in programming languages. In this article, we compared the speed of codes to find Prime Number functions in C++ and Python</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Prime numbers are an interesting area to research. A&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>prime number</strong></a>, it is also called&nbsp;<strong>prime</strong>&nbsp;shortly, is a natural number (a positive integer) greater than one that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. If a number is not prime then it is called a&nbsp;<strong>composed number</strong>. There are several mathematical questions regarding prime numbers that are still unsolved. Finding them and relations and their effects on some other functions, graphics really interesting in mathematical phenomena.</p>
<p>In the programming world today,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>&nbsp;is very popular and easy to use. It makes popular because of supports from big companies (i.e. Google) and its successful libraries and frameworks on AI Technology. It is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared with C/C++, Delphi, Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme, or Java. Python has very clear syntax and it has some practical things. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for other applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use. Python is free to use and more information can be found from their official web page&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
<p>C and C++ are the fastest and one of the most powerful programming languages and it is easy to calculate prime numbers as fast as possible. In these tests we will use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">C++ Builder</a>&nbsp;which has a great IDE, includes compilers for Win32, Win64, Android, and iOS. C++Builder has both CLANG Enhanced C/C++ Compiler and Embarcadero’s new Bcc C/C++ Compiler. It also features a modern, high-productivity RAD Studio IDE, debugger tools, and enterprise connectivity to accelerate cross-platform UI development. You can develop GUI based applications easily, as it comes with the award-winning VCL framework for high-performance native Windows apps and the powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform UIs. There is a free C++ Builder Community Edition that can be used by students, beginners, and startups with limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the free C++ Builder Community Edition here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter</a>. Professional developers can use the Professional, Architect, or Enterprise versions of C++ Builder. Please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder</a>.</p>
<p>Python can be used inside Delphi projects and this prime number function is tested before in Delphi and in Python here&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM</a>&nbsp;with Kiriakos Vlahos. Here, we were inspired by this video and we try to do the same tests on the same function in C++. Finding Prime Numbers in C++ is explained in detailed well in this&nbsp;<strong>Easily Learn To Find Prime Numbers In Modern C++</strong>&nbsp;post&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/easily-learn-to-find-prime-numbers-in-modern-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we compared the speed of Prime Number functions in C++ Builder 10.4 and Python 3.9.1.</p>

<p>In these counting prime numbers tests we also found that Python 3.9.1 version looks faster than 3.7.9 version which comes with current Spyder editor. It is obvious that 64bits test doubles 32bits test in speed.</p>
<p>We also tested counting prime numbers with same procedures in C++ Builder with system information in <a href="https://learncplusplus.org/interesting-c-builder-compiler-counting-prime-number-benchmarks/">our post here</a> before. Here are some of results.</p>

<p>These tables above show that calculating the number of prime numbers in 32bits takes 0.494 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 8.770 seconds In this test, in comparison C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>17.8 times faster in 32bits</strong>&nbsp;and calculating number of prime numbers in 64bits takes 0.350 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 3.298 seconds that means C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>9.4 times faster in 64bits</strong>. Note that we made the same tests before with&nbsp;<strong>GNUC/C++</strong>&nbsp;on the same system and we post it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/quickly-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-gnu-c-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-visual-studio-code-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>VSCode</strong>&nbsp;before, and we did the same tests on the latest Dev-C++ and results can be found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/dev-c-tutorial-easily-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

<p>We also found that Python 3.7.9 comes with Spyder is slower than 3.9.1 in our tests. Here is a table in comparison with C++ Builder below.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the same PC System, our tests show that C++ ( C++ Builder BCC &amp; CLANG, GNU C/C++, Dev C++, VS Code) is about 9.4 times faster than Python on counting prime numbers in 64 bits and about 17.8 times faster in 32 bits. The calculating number of prime numbers is good to use some basic logical operations and mathematical functions. The procedure includes logical if() clauses, for() loops, some mathematical procedures (floor, sqrt etc.), that show C++ is very fast in mathematical operations. These kinds of tests can be done in different operations to compare languages.</p>
<p>Note that all tests were done on a single core/thread test. C++ Builder is capable to do Threads and easy to use Parallel algorithms for multi-thread operations. It shows that threaded tests are much faster, depends on the number of cores/threads.</p>
<p>Actually, results were obvious because of Python is an interpreted programming language with some benefits while C/C++ is a non-interpreted (compiled) programing language. Here C++ proofs that still it is very fast to do mathematical operations in comparison with Python. These kinds of tests can be done on many mathematical operations and on other codes. Speed changes may improve analyzes and other operations (i.e face detection, image processing, or other AI technologies). If your applications are built with C++ they will have faster operations in each task. On the other side, Python has some advantages in coding, easy to code, well on AI technologies with some TensorFlow, Keras frameworks. Users should define their priorities before coding an application and they should choose their programming language for their projects.</p>
<p>Please keep following our next posts on these tests.</p>

<p>Welcome to Fluxtion streaming and thanks for coming, hope you enjoy exploring :)</p>

<p>Fluxtion is a java utility that builds embeddable, reactive complex event processors. 
The streaming api uses a functional programming style to define business logic. Write simple clean Java code 
to create real-time applications. All the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion, 
programs are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.</p>

<p>Fluxtion focuses on the processing logic of event streams, independent of messaging system. Areas of good fit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedding real-time processing</strong> within an existing system</li>
  <li><strong>Edge processing</strong> executing on edge devices</li>
  <li><strong>No middleware vendor lock-in</strong> works with any messaging provider</li>
  <li><strong>Low latency</strong> or high performance requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Auditable systems</strong> supports ahead of time compilation</li>
</ul>

<p>Data streams can be merged, filtered, aggregated, joined, grouped and enriched. 
Windowing of data is fully supported. User functions are easily integrated to directly execute actions in addition to real-time monitoring.</p>

<p>A full set of tools for debugging, tracing, auditing and visualisation are provided to reduce development and support costs.</p>

<p>A Fluxtion event processor embeds within a user application, processing events, 
publishing events to sinks or interacting with user classes. Events are feed from 
the application directly into the processor or into a pipeline. A pipeline provides 
additional capabilities such as threading, scheduling, auditing, access control</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="comp-kknyjvzi" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Recently I was asked this question and it got me thinking. This article is still an ongoing piece of work so any comments and suggestions are welcome.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>I have worked in the last 10 years as an iOS native developer. I’ve had to manage my own memory in Objective-C with [retain] and [release] and got to work with Swift 5 and Autolayout. I also dipped my toes into Android, React Native, Ionic and have previously worked with C++, .net, J2ME and others.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hence from my experience these are some types of companies that would benefit from doing things all native (iOS, Android or both):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Companies that already started with native apps a long time before and already have a significant codebase in native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies for whom money is not a problem, but quality and performance is very important. They want the best there is and have no problem paying for that. Usually these are already large companies with a lot of sales and that have an important brand to protect. Ex: Banks, Automotive, Telecoms, Airlines, Electronics etc..</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Companies that require a project that heavily uses some features close to the operating system. Examples: heavy use of video, or graphics, some types of games, fitness trackers or other apps that make constant use of sensors and run in the background. They also need to be the first that take advantage of a new feature in the OS.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Companies that require a large and complex project. If you have a project with a complex UI and with many features. &nbsp;Often these are companies that already have a cross-platform project but it has become so large that it is getting difficult to maintain and might already have performance issues that are causing a bad user experience. They already are paying for a team of developers to maintain the app so there won’t be much of an economy if switching to native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Companies whose core service is through an app. Examples: Uber, Revolut, etc.. These are companies who cannot risk the app being broken or taken offline because of a change in the framework they are using. Moreover they require the app to work flawlessly, and be so good as to be featured in the AppStore or Google Play. Being in the top 5 apps is almost a requirement. Therefore it’s better to use the native tools that are guaranteed to be supported and that allow for a great user experience.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. For startups that need an MVP I would recommend starting with a native app in only one platform Android or iOS, whichever is closer to their potential customers. After you test it in the real world and have gone through several iterations of build+validation and started to have traction and funding, you can now invest in a second app for the other platform, having the advantage that you already have the first. Going native will allow you to iterate faster because the development process is making use of better tools and better support. Otherwise if you would start with a cross-platform solution you will find at some point that it doesn’t scale, or it has become too buggy and unstable to support different UIs (iPhone, iPad, Android, watch etc) from one codebase and that you will be forced to rebuild native anyway.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What companies would NOT benefit from native app development vs cross-platform apps?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; 1. Companies that already have a working mobile website and want to reuse a lot of that code then it’s probably better to go cross-platform.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies that have a lot of programmers and know-how in a certain technology ( ex: Javascript, Microsoft technologies) and wish to leverage that. If you have many people with experience in .net, you might want to try Xamarin. Likewise if you have many people with experience in React or other Javascript frameworks, you might want to try React Native or Ionic. This still means you occasionally will need to find someone who can work with native but those can be outside consultants and most of the codebase can be maintained by using the know-how inside the company.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Internal apps that must work on many platforms and UI smoothness and beauty is not a concern, but resources in terms of people and time are.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you need to make an app that you don’t think will be maintained. Examples are apps for conferences or promotional campaigns that will only be used for a period of time and are afterwards useless, apps for conducting studies or surveys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you have an app that should look the same way across all platforms disregarding UI guidelines. Examples: Many games are like that, made in Unity or other frameworks and have their own look and feel which is platform independent.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Frequent issues with cross-platform solutions:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Memory issues when scaling the app.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Animations and “snappiness”. Animations will not be automatically supported and actually more difficult to implement in cross-platform solutions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Lack of proper tools — Often, there is no debugger and no performance measurement tools.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Uncertainty of whether that platform will still be supported in a few years. There have been cases of cross-platform tools that were either abandoned (Flash) or acquired and then axed (Parse). Even so, generally there seems to be a trend of people liking the newest cross-platform tools</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A tendency to prefer the "new and trending" tools</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div><div id="comp-kko39lkc" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-dont-use-cross-platform-mobile-dev-tools-ac57ddc582b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Too small community. Programmers need other programmers to learn from or use their open-source code. If there aren’t many others then you will be stuck fixing some obscure bug or having to build something from scratch for that particular platform.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You still need access to native developers. Some parts will still have to be made native and often bugs will have to be fixed in the bridging platform. In RN there is a frequent issue of using open-source libraries that are not maintained or are buggy and some work still needs to be made on the native part to keep them up-to-date.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Many companies that started with cross-platform tools have ultimately abandoned them: Facebook, <span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></span>, <span><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a></span>, etc..&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Delayed access to having the latest and greatest of what features the OS can provide. New features released on Android and iOS must be adapted in order to be available using cross-platform libraries. This means there will be an unknown delay between their official release and being able to use them in your code.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

                    <div>
                        
<p>Chances are you are reading this blog post using your web browser. Chances also are your web browser has various extensions that provide additional functionality. We usually trust that the extensions installed from official browser stores are safe. But that is not always the case as we recently found.</p>



<p>This blog post brings more technical details on CacheFlow: a threat that we first <a href="https://blog.avast.com/malicious-browser-extensions-avast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about in December 2020. We described a huge campaign composed of dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions with more than three million installations in total. We alerted both Google and Microsoft about the presence of these malicious extensions on their respective extension stores and are happy to announce that both companies have since taken all of them down as of December 18, 2020.</p>



<p>CacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their command and control traffic in a covert channel using the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header of their analytics requests. We believe this is a new technique. In addition, it appears to us that the Google Analytics-style traffic was added not just to hide the malicious commands, but that the extension authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves. We believe they tried to solve two problems, command and control and getting analytics information, with one solution.</p>



<p>We found that CacheFlow would carry out its attack in the following sequence:</p>

<p>Based on our telemetry, the top three countries where Avast users downloaded and installed the CacheFlow extensions were Brazil, Ukraine, and France.</p>

<p>We initially learned about this campaign by reading a <a href="https://blog.nic.cz/2020/11/19/hledani-skodliveho-kodu-mezi-doplnky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech blog post by Edvard Rejthar from CZ.NIC</a>. He discovered that the Chrome extension “Video Downloader for FaceBook™” (ID <code>pfnmibjifkhhblmdmaocfohebdpfppkf</code>) was stealthily loading an obfuscated piece of JavaScript that had nothing to do with the extension’s advertised functionality. Continuing from his findings, we managed to find many other extensions that were doing the same thing. These other extensions offered various legitimate functionality, with many of them being video downloaders for popular social media platforms. After reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript, we found that the main malicious payload delivered by these extensions was responsible for malicious browser redirects. Not only that, but the cybercriminals were also collecting quite a lot of data about the users of the malicious extensions, such as all of their search engine queries or information about everything they clicked on.</p>



<p>The extensions exhibited quite a high level of sneakiness by employing many tricks to lower the chances of detection. First of all, they avoided infecting users who were likely to be web developers. They determined this either through the extensions the user had installed or by checking if the user accessed locally-hosted websites. Furthermore, the extensions delayed their malicious activity for at least three days after installation to avoid raising red flags early on. When the malware detected that the browser developer tools were opened, it would immediately deactivate its malicious functionality. CacheFlow also checked every Google search query and if the user was googling for one of the malware’s command and control (C&amp;C) domains, it reported this to its C&amp;C server and could deactivate itself as well.</p>



<p>According to user reviews on the Chrome Web Store, it seems that CacheFlow was active since at least October 2017. All of the stealthiness described above could explain why it stayed undetected for so long.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="913" height="165" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png 913w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-300x54.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-768x139.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px"><figcaption>User review on the Chrome Web Store from October 2017 that mentions modification of Google search results</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>The covert channel</h2>



<p>First, we’ll show the hidden backdoor that the extensions used to download and execute arbitrary JavaScript. Specifically, we’ll describe the backdoor from the Chrome extension “Downloader for Instagram” v5.7.3 (ID <code>olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe</code>), but this analysis applies to the other extensions as well, since the malicious code hidden in them is very similar in functionality.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DErNJa7s3X7-EUGOvCPpQEsJkAFH3KdRvBFxQiWH37NiSAKIUFvxmKssQ6m0i5zTskNWTeV8pfeCj7secZzSG2uckKlFTISyB4r1PwuDMYvf5CkgITiXM_V2UR3QYIZsSElCeuDm" alt=""><figcaption>“Downloader for Instagram” page on the Chrome Web Store</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is generally a good idea to start the analysis of unknown Chrome extensions from the <code>manifest.json</code> file. The manifest of “Downloader for Instagram” gives us some interesting pieces of information.</p>



<p>First of all, the <code>content_security_policy</code> is defined in such a way that it is possible to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous</a> <code>eval</code> function to load additional JavaScript. However, looking for the string <code>eval</code> in the extension’s source code did not yield any interesting results. As we’ll show later, the extension does use the <code>eval</code> function quite a lot, but it hides its usage, so it is not immediately apparent.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/plYZi8H7ohhbAAGn3HoHfsRhaKu0FOSM27Fk6aINue25-LuOKNcgZHVJBIEY8-YtNffVboZryyjaWPgSQqa7HdiL5QBnjdulWfjr30YwBNTzaI8bBoaRSZiFyDpVWMF10DOf6mnI" alt=""><figcaption>Content Security Policy definition from the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Secondly, the extension asks for quite a lot of permissions and it is not immediately clear why these permissions would be needed to download videos from Instagram. Especially interesting is the <code>management</code> permission, which allows the extension to control other extensions. The combination of the <code>webRequest</code> and the <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code> permissions is also interesting. Together, these two permissions make it possible for the extension to intercept pretty much any web request coming from the browser.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GXlvV4yTGeWbiZn6q7WjmNOfxq-jQx8pYbqFCwcgLU8Li3I_i8_YQ7C-QXdSMBm03-LaGuk-ZhkVbn15nD0UZ2a7BFYaSdFAIsXPTbGmn4rFZRXpgDn3cyBZBwS8oVq07i6NnetY" alt=""><figcaption>Permissions requested by the malicious extensions</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Finally, the manifest defines two background scripts: <code>js/jquery.js</code> and <code>js/background.js</code>. These scripts are persistent, which means that they will keep running unless the extension gets disabled.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tflzmxXmCyqagTiUbTkHb7DfNI4It30R0hHDVjZh7WeAiV-bl4f6ve33LXphmm84N9kO_epPU1iIhI2S0vE6powG9jB5ufNMJ1ima-gEKgVyZx-_8RbfQyzCXaiPExZqMsDfpO-i" alt=""><figcaption>Background scripts declared in the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of these background scripts, <code>background.js</code>, is where the suspicious <code>webRequest</code> API is used. This script accesses the HTTP response headers of all intercepted web requests and stores their values in localStorage.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kB_RAWUKhE4467ei82a1zl_u6pXyfB5eEtzfXI_kjFMKqXSWGjk9VHbNsndNB-EesAb3yZAUFy7nGr4jQPK3Ok7BTwm9Iih-eGXzFqVV7gBiPxdBb2ZSzNAlxjzFviBWDSJOAht3" alt=""><figcaption>CacheFlow saves the values of all sufficiently long HTTP response headers into localStorage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The content of localStorage is then read by the other persistent malicious background script: <code>jquery.js</code>. While this script appears at first glance to be the legitimate <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jQuery</a> library, some additional functions were inserted into it. One of those additional functions is misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code>, while all it does is return the <code>window.localStorage</code> object.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TeINLg0HORJ_P0DDJbaEsBs_cz5hA2fDGSSb6orJ76THL7JKjxYj1UOj-Atkn89kjg1Zfmk6tQTL-LzlneXJh4Kj1MizzyCDh66jonO8tMc3EL-sNA3dNyBLmcNTbNEOPxAumWKi" alt=""><figcaption>Misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code> function hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another inserted and misleadingly named function is <code>initAjax</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="456" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png 1006w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-300x136.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"><figcaption><code>initAjax</code> function decodes the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code> and stores decoded values in the <code>window</code> object.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This function is particularly interested in the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code>, which should at this point be set to the value of the last received <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP response header. The function splits the content of this header with a comma and attempts to decrypt each part using a custom function named <code>strrevsstr</code>, before finally parsing it out as a JSON string.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/goWFLSGQb0chknR4jrq9RWhhwgku6ms3lXOQy7Ix-n7YM9WsmAzRZ4OonUGJV6Pm6pmt_NHOYeSKEDdyuYt029lAhBsR6fy3VNkgJu0UU25TSAnMZpAAOpmuVfPsRzkfySTLJSI3" alt=""><figcaption><code>strrevsstr</code> function used by the extension to decrypt strings</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The obvious question now is why would the extension expect to intercept requests that contain an encrypted JSON string in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is that the threat actors are using the content of the <code>Cache-Control</code> header as a covert channel to send hidden commands to the malicious extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the malicious extension’s regular functionality, analytics requests about some events are sent to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. These are standard analytics requests that bear resemblance to Google Analytics. The catch is, that the server used by this extension might respond to the analytics requests with a specially formed <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which the client will decrypt, parse out and execute.</p>

<p>To see what the commands could look like, we simulated the extension and sent a fake analytics HTTP request to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. After a couple of attempts, we received a specially crafted <code>Cache-Control</code> header.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/evazuvvQ91jdK50XsV34gbeOAkRH_vJz6mptWRlJtBgQQbyK-JOEPrAsshMkMLZdHcxZUJORtwLANqhWO1e6W_QLMx1K2e5JNi6rg9zDYr2n7IK_beX5bKLYfJDobQyfe2hy9o7G" alt=""><figcaption>Fiddler capture of a seemingly innocent analytics request that contains a hidden command in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that the response will contain the encoded command only when some conditions are met. First of all, the GET parameter <code>it</code> has to be set at least three days into the past. Since this parameter contains the time when the extension was installed, this effectively ensures that the extension will not exhibit any malicious behavior during the first three days. There is also a check based on the IP address, since we repeatedly did not receive any commands from one source IP address, even though we did receive a command for the same GET request from another IP address. As the logic behind these checks is safely hidden on the C&amp;C server, there might be additional checks that we are not aware of.</p>



<p>When the content of the received <code>Cache-Control</code> header is <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/CacheFlow/extras/decryptor_strrevsstr.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoded</a> using the custom <code>strrevsstr</code> function as outlined above, we get the command in the following JSON. As was seen in the <code>initAjax</code> function, all of the attributes from this JSON get stored in the global <code>window</code> object.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="642" height="134" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png 642w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1-300x63.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"><figcaption>Command decoded from the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving such a command, the extension downloads the second stage from <code>command['uu']</code> in a function named <code>siblingAfter</code>, which is also hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code>. The dollar sign from <code>command['jj']</code> here represents the <code>jQuery</code> object, so the function uses the <code>jQuery.get</code> function to download the next stage from <code>command['uu']</code> and to store it in <code>localStorage.dataDefault</code>.</p>

					<p>The laser scanning microscope is a special light microscope which uses a focused laser beam to scans the sample. The scanning of the laser across the sample is done by driving the laser in x and y direction.&nbsp; The image is composed in the software by combining the measured light points.</p>
<p>The DVD Laser Scanner Microscope is build from two DVD pick-up heads. The laser of the DVD head is used to illuminate the sample at a tiny spot, focused with the DVD heads own focusing mechanism. The deviation of the laser is done by the pick-up heads lens moving coils.</p>

<h6>Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</h6>
<p>A special case is the confocal laser scanning microscopy that enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from sets of images obtained at different depths. Confocal laser scanning microscopes are often used in combination with fluorescence to study properties of biological samples such as cells.</p>

<h6>Image Resolution</h6>
<p>The resolution of the image is defined by the number of measurements taken in x direction and the number of lines in y. The maximum resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the system’s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser as in conventional optical microscopes. In fluorescence observations, the resolution is often limited by the strength of the signal. More sensitive photo-detectors or increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser can compensate.</p>

<h6>Prototype Setup</h6>
<p>The first prototype set-up uses two pick-up head. One is emitting the laser and scanning in x direction. The second pick-up head carries the sample and moves in y direction. The photo-detector on the laser unit is removed and the signal is captured with a simple photo-diode. The coils are controlled by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino</a> with drive electronics and the images is rendered in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Here’s what I learned from reading the first part of the fzf README and paying attention. Now I have a better setup and understanding of the basics, and in particular how to control the appearance.</em></p>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/02/01/do-less-and-do-it-better/">doing less and doing it better</a> I decided to start learning more about <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, the “command line fuzzy finder”. Learning more wasn’t difficult, because despite using it for quite a while, I’ve never really read any of the documentation, and have thus only scratched its surface.</p>

<p>So I started with the first part of the main <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, and here’s what I found.</p>

<p>The examples I give in this post are taken from a directory and file structure reflecting the <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote">SAP TechEd 2020 Developer Keynote repository</a>, which has multiple directories and subdirectories, lots of files with different extensions, hidden files and directories (and I’m not just talking about the <code>.git/</code> directory) and also stuff that we often want excluded, such as any <code>node_modules/</code> directories. Fairly representative and useful for illustration.</p>

<p><strong>An awareness of new and changed features</strong></p>

<p>I was using an older version of <code>fzf</code> because I hadn’t upgraded it; a quick <code>brew update; brew upgrade fzf</code> later and I was using the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.25.0">latest release</a>. Not absolutely essential for me, but doing this makes me more aware of the fact that fixes and features do come along, and also exposes me to options that I might not have known about. So an indirect but useful advantage already.</p>

<p>I’d <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/commit/68f3c40a76ddd2d8c5c08463855a59ed0e6d7c74#diff-53370cdb3bc79473f0579d40685f8516cc93a2c60b4382e60cb94c09d0c2bfc2R1">already installed the keybindings</a> keybindings (to get <code>fzf</code> to react on Ctrl-T and Ctrl-C) so that was still OK.</p>

<p><strong>Basic navigation</strong></p>

<p>I’d been using the arrow keys to move up and down in the list that <code>fzf</code> presents. The shame of it! Now I’ve learned that I can use Vim style key bindings to move up (Ctrl-J) and down (Ctrl-K) I feel less unclean. There’s even support for the mousewheel, but the less said about that the better.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s time to get to the main topic of this post - how to affect <code>fzf</code>’s appearance, or layout.</p>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, <code>fzf</code> will use the entire height of your current terminal to display the choices, and this is more or less how I’ve mostly used <code>fzf</code> thus far:</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way; in the Layout category of options there’s <code>--height</code> with which you can tell <code>fzf</code> only to use a certain percentage of the terminal’s height.</p>



<p>Moreover, the jump from the line I was on when <code>fzf</code> was invoked, down to the bottom of the screen where I was to make my choice, was a little jarring for me.</p>

<p>I’d vaguely (but mistakenly) thought that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> option, also in the Layout category, was something to do with the sort order of the choices presented. Turns out that the order can be reversed with the <code>--tac</code> option (taken from the name of <code>tac</code>, a command independent of <code>fzf</code>, whose name is the opposite of <code>cat</code>, see?) and that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> relates to the general presentation of the choices.</p>

<p>So with <code>--layout=reverse</code> I can reduce that jarring by having the place where I make my choice at the top of the list rather than at the bottom, like this:</p>



<p>There’s a couple of other options that I found that made the appearance even better for me, but these are more subjective.</p>

<p>First, I can get a border around everything with the Layout option <code>--border</code>. In fact there are multiple values that can be specified for this option; the default is to make a rounded border around all four sides.</p>

<p>Then I can save a bit of space by specifying the value <code>inline</code> for the <code>--info</code> option, also in the Layout category, to get the stats displayed on the same line as my input.</p>

<p>Here’s both of those options in action:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>In this and the next asciicast, the right hand edge of the border is not properly displayed or reproduced in asciinema for some reason; just imagine that the options are nicely boxed all the way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we leave the Layout category, there’s a couple of other options that can give a nice effect, especially for making <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/"><code>dmenu</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi"><code>rofi</code></a> style popup menus. These are <code>--margin</code> and <code>--padding</code>. I’ve found that to get a popup menu effect, it’s worth leaving off the height option (<code>--height</code>) to get full screen:</p>



<p><strong>Next time</strong></p>

<p>That’s about it for what I’ve learned about controlling the appearance. There’s actually plenty more on this in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Note right now that there are 17688 entries in the list of choices presented to me. That’s a lot, and far more than I’d ever actually want to select from. Next time I’ll take a look at a couple of <code>fzf</code> environment variables, one of which controls what command <code>fzf</code> uses, and how that can be changed to affect what gets displayed (or not displayed) in the choice list, so I can address that large number of entries issue.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
			

			<div>
				
<p>Reading a blog post about what’s <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/en/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">coming up in JDK 16</a> recently,
I learned that one of the new features is support for Unix domain sockets (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380">JEP 380</a>).
Before Java 16, you’d have to resort to 3rd party libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket">jnr-unixsocket</a> in order to use them.
If you haven’t heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix domain sockets</a> before,
they are "data communications [endpoints] for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system".
Don’t be put off by the name btw.;
Unix domain sockets are also supported by macOS and even Windows since <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/">version 10</a>.</p>
<p>Databases such as Postgres or MySQL use them for offering an alternative to TCP/IP-based connections to client applications running on the same machine as the database.
In such scenario,
Unix domain sockets are both more secure
(no remote access to the database is exposed at all; file system permissions can be used for access control),
and also <a href="https://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#June_6_2012">more efficient</a> than TCP/IP loopback connections.</p>
<p>A common use case are proxies for accessing Cloud-based databases,
such as as the GCP <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#proxy_startup_options">Cloud SQL Proxy</a>.
Running on the same machine as a client application
(e.g. in a sidecar container in case of Kubernetes deployments),
they provide secure access to a managed database, for instance taking care of the SSL handling.</p>
<p>My curiousity was piqued and I was wondering what it’d take to make use of the new Java 16 Unix domain socket for connecting to Postgres.
It was your regular evening during the pandemic,
without much to do, so I thought "Let’s give this a try".
To have a testing bed, I started with installing Postgres 13 on Fedora 33.
Fedora might not always have the latest Postgres version packaged just yet,
but following the official <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/">Postgres instructions</a> it is straight-forward to install newer versions.</p>
<p>In order to connect with user name and password via a Unix domain socket,
one small adjustment to <em>/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf</em> is needed:
the access <code>method</code> for the <code>local</code> connection type must be switched from the default value <code>peer</code>
(which would try to authenticate using the operating system user name of the client process) to <code>md5</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>...
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Make sure to apply the changed configuration by restarting the database
(<code>systemctl restart postgresql-13</code>),
and things are ready to go.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_postgres_jdbc_driver">The Postgres JDBC Driver</h2>
<div>
<p>The first thing I looked into was the Postgres <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/">JDBC driver</a>.
Since version <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_9.4-1208">9.4-1208</a> (released in 2016) it allows you to configure custom socket factories,
a feature which explicitly was added considering Unix domain sockets.
The driver itself doesn’t come with a socket factory implementation that’d actually support Unix domain sockets,
but a few external open-source implementations exist.
Most notably junixsocket provides such <a href="https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/dependency.html#PostgreSQL">socket factory</a>.</p>
<p>Custom socket factories must extend <code>javax.net.SocketFactory</code>,
and their fully-qualified class name needs to be specified using the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#unix%20sockets">socketFactory</a> driver parameter.
So it should be easy to create <code>SocketFactory</code> implementation based on the new <a href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk16/docs/api/java.base/java/net/UnixDomainSocketAddress.html">UnixDomainSocketAddress</a> class, right?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory</span> <span>extends</span> <span>SocketFactory</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Override</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>socket</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Socket</span><span>();</span>
    <span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>UnixDomainSocketAddress</span><span>.</span><span>of</span><span>(</span>
        <span>"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"</span><span>));</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
    <span>return</span> <span>socket</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// other create methods ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Create a Unix domain socket address for the default path of the socket on Fedora and related systems</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It compiles just fine;
but it turns out not all socket addresses are equal,
and <code>java.net.Socket</code> only connects to addresses of type <code>InetSocketAddress</code>
(and the PG driver maintainers seem to sense some air of mystery around these "unusual" events, too):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Something unusual has occurred to cause the driver to fail. Please report this exception.
  at org.postgresql.Driver.connect(Driver.java:285)
  ...

Caused by:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported address type
  at java.base/java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:629)

  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:19)
  ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now JEP 380 solely speaks about <code>SocketChannel</code> and stays silent about <code>Socket</code>;
but perhaps obtaining a socket from a domain socket channel works?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>sc</span> <span>=</span> <span>SocketChannel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>UnixDomainSocketAddress</span><span>.</span><span>of</span><span>(</span>
      <span>"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>sc</span><span>.</span><span>socket</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nope, no luck either:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Not supported
  at java.base/sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.socket(SocketChannelImpl.java:226)
  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:17)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Indeed it looks like JEP 380 is concerning itself only with the non-blocking <code>SocketChannel</code> API,
while users of the blocking <code>Socket</code> API do not get to benefit from it.
It should be possible to create a custom <code>Socket</code> implementation based on the socket channel support of JEP 380,
but that’s going beyond the scope of my little exploration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_vert_x_postgres_client">The Vert.x Postgres Client</h2>
<div>
<p>If the Postgres JDBC driver doesn’t easily benefit from the JEP,
what about other Java Postgres clients then?
There are several non-blocking options,
including the <a href="https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/">Vert.x Postgres client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/r2dbc-postgresql">R2DBC</a>.
The former is used to bring Reactive capabilities for Postgres into the Quarkus stack, too,
so I turned my attention to it.</p>
<p>Now the Vert.x Postgres Client already has support for Unix domain sockets,
by means of adding the right Netty native transport dependency to your project.
So purely from functionality perspective, there’s not that much to be gained here.
But being able to use domain sockets also with the default NIO transport would still be nice,
as it means one less dependency to take care of.
So I dug a bit into the code of the Postgres client and Vert.x itself and figured out, that two things needed adjustment:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The NIO-based <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/net/impl/transport/Transport.java"><code>Transport</code></a> class of Vert.x needs to learn about the fact that <code>SocketChannel</code> now also supports Unix domain sockets (currently, an exception is raised when trying to use them without a Netty native transport)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netty’s <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/socket/nio/NioSocketChannel.java"><code>NioSocketChannel</code></a> needs some small changes, as it tries to obtain a <code>Socket</code> from the underlying <code>SocketChannel</code>, which doesn’t work for domain sockets as we’ve seen above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Step 1 was quickly done by creating a custom sub-class of the default <code>Transport</code> class.
Two methods needed changes:
<code>channelFactory()</code> for obtaining a factory for the actual Netty transport channel,
and <code>convert()</code> for converting a Vert.x <code>SocketAddress</code> into a NIO one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>UnixDomainTransport</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Transport</span> <span>{</span>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="4"></i><b>4</b></td>
<td>Create a <code>UnixDomainSocketAddress</code> for the socket’s file system path</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> class.
I was hoping to get away again with creating a sub-class of the NIO-based implementation,
<code>io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel</code> in this case.
Unfortunately, though, the <code>NioSocketChannel</code> constructor invokes the taboo <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> method.
Of course that’d not be a problem when doing this change in Netty itself,
but for my little exploration I ended up copying the class and doing the required adjustments in that copy.
I ended up doing two small changes:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the call to <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> in the constructor:</p>
<div>

<p>A few methods call the <code>Socket</code> methods <code>isInputShutdown()</code> and <code>isOutputShutdown()</code>;
those should be possible to be by-passed by keeping track of the two shutdown flags ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I was creating the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> in my own namespace instead of Netty’s packages,
a few references to the non-public method <code>NioChannelOption#getOptions()</code> needed commenting out,
which again shouldn’t be relevant for the domain socket case</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the complete change in <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/unix-domain-socket-poc/commit/9d8502f5c47cb59162e325640db54672f1ed8b68">this commit</a>.
All in all, not exactly an artisanal piece of software engineering,
but the little hack seemed good enough at least for taking a quick glimpse at the new domain socket support.
Of course a real implementation could be done much more properly within the Netty project itself.</p>
<p>So it was time to give this thing a test ride.
As we need to configure the custom <code>Transport</code> implementation,
retrieval of a <code>PgPool</code> instance is a tad more verbose than usual:</p>

            <p id="article-description">Using my own web server accesslogs and public
            latency data to get a quantitative answer and why roundtrips are such a
            pain.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/network-transit-times.svg" alt="...">

                    <p>As network latencies grow, strange things can happen: "fat"
                    sites can become fast (especially if served completely from CDN)
                    and "thin" sites that use APIs can become slow. A typical latency
                    for a desktop/laptop user is 200ms, for a 4G mobile user,
                    300-400ms.</p>
                    <p>I've assumed <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/896779/average-mobile-fixed-broadband-download-upload-speeds/">
                    40 megabit bandwidth</a>, TLS, latency to CDN of <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2019/08/28/analysing-global-cdn-performance/">
                    40ms</a> and no existing connections.</p>
                    <p>"Origin" here means the primary webserver (as opposed to "edge"
                    CDN caches).</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What's the fastest place to put my server? Beyond the time taken for
            servers to respond to requests it takes time just to traverse the internet,
            just to get a packet from A to B.</p>
            <p>To estimate what the theoretical best physical place to put my own
            server is I've combined publicly available data on latencies with my own
            web server accesslogs. I'm aiming to get a rough, quantitative, answer
            that's based on a real data set.</p>
            <h2>Why location matters</h2>
            <p>Time taken to traverse the internet is added to the time taken to
            respond to a request. Even if your API can respond to a request in 1ms, if
            the user is in London and your API server is in California the user still
            has to wait ~130 milliseconds for the response.</p>
            <p>It's a bit worse than just 130 milliseconds. Depending on what a user is
            doing they may end up making a number of those roundtrips. To download a
            web page usually requires five full roundtrips: one to resolve the domain
            name via DNS, one to establish the TCP connection, two more to set up an
            encrypted session with TLS and one, finally, for the page you wanted in the
            first place.</p>
            <p>Subsequent requests <em>can</em> (but don't always) reuse the DNS, TCP
            and TLS setup but a new roundtrip is still needed each time the server is
            consulted, for example for an API call or a new page.</p>
            <p>130ms sounded fast at first, but the rigmarole of just getting a page
            and then making an couple of API calls can easily end up taking most of a
            second just in terms of time waiting for the network. All the other time
            required: for the server to decide what response to send to your request,
            time downloading the thing and then rendering whatever it is in your
            browser - that is all extra.</p>
            <h3>The two kinds of "fast" for networks</h3>
            <p>One of the confusing things about networking is the inspecific way in
            which people talk of getting "faster" networking: "faster" residental
            broadband for example, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet">"fast ethernet"</a> (100
            megabits per second, no longer impressive).</p>
            <p>This kind of "faster" is not in fact talking about speed. Greater speed
            would be reduced latency - so faster roundtrips. Instead "faster"
            networking is really about <em>greater bandwidth</em>: more bytes per
            second.</p>
            <h3>APIs or CDNs</h3>
            <p>One thing that does make things faster: a Content Distribution Network
            (or CDN). Instead of going all the way to California perhaps you can
            retrieve some of the web page from a cache in central London. Doing this
            saves time - perhaps taking just 50 milliseconds, a saving of 60%. Caches
            work great for CSS files, images and javascript - stuff that doesn't change
            for each user. It doesn't work as well for the responses to API calls, for
            which the responses are different for each user, and sometimes, each
            time.</p>
            <h2>A quantitative approach</h2>
            <p>A happy few can serve everything from their CDN. News sites, for
            example, show the exact same thing to everyone. Others are less lucky and
            can make only limited, or no, use of caching. These poor people have to
            pick a location for their main server to help them get their bytes to the
            users who want them as fast as possible. If they want to make that choice
            with the sole aim of reducing latency, where should they pick?</p>
            <p>Here's what I did:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I took my own accesslogs for a two week period in September just
                after I'd published something new. I got about a million requests
                during this period from 143k unique IPs. I excluded obvious robots
                (which was ~10% of requests).</li>
                <li>I used Maxmind's GeoIP database to geocode each IP address in those
                accesslogs to geographic co-ordinates.</li>
                <li>I then used <a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">WonderNetwork's published latency
                data</a> for internet latencies between ~240 world cities.
                </li>
                <li>I mapped those cities (semi-manually, which was pretty painful)
                from their names to <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a>
                ids - which gave me co-ordinates for the cities.
                </li>
                <li>Then I loaded all of the above into a Postgres database with the
                <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension installed so I
                could do geographical queries.
                </li>
                <li>I queried to estimate how long, by percentile, requests would have
                taken if I'd had my server in each of the 200 cities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The results</h2>
            <p>In the table below I've recorded the outcome: how long users would take
            to complete a single roundtrip to my server if it were in each city. I've
            done this by percentiles so you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the average ("p50")</li>
                <li>for three quarters of requests ("p75")</li>
                <li>and for 99% of requests ("p99")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All numbers are in milliseconds.</p>

It gets a control plane and a set of worker nodes, and leverages Rook and Ceph to get Persistent Volume support.</p><h2 id="why">Why install Kubernetes using kubespray?</h2><p>The reasons why one might want to install Kubernetes “manually” are many:</p><ul><li>Allows you to run Kubernetes on cloud providers even if they do not offer a managed Kubernetes service such as AKS, EKS, or GKE.</li><li>Not entangled with the cloud provider’s IAM or other services, which makes a multi-cloud strategy easier to implement in practice. This way, your tools and processes will not be cloud-vendor specific.</li><li>Allows full control over the control plane: if you want to install, e.g., an OpenID Connect provider such as Dex to integrate with your Identity Provider (IdP), you can. With a managed service, what you can or cannot do is at the mercy of your cloud provider.</li></ul><p>So let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Our cluster setup is as following:</p><ul><li>One control plane node: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB local storage.</li><li>Three worker nodes: 8GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 100GB local storage each.</li></ul><p>All nodes are running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The cluster is running Kubernetes v1.19.7 and is installed using kubespray 2.15.0. You will also need Terraform to follow along with this guide.</p><h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2><p>The first thing that is needed is to set up all the infrastructure needed for the cluster.</p><h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3><p>The easiest way to deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster is to use the Terraform script from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a></p><p>Clone kubespray for the script. Exoscale support is on master right now.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
cd kubespray<br></code></pre><p>Create a new folder in the inventory folder for your cluster.</p><pre><code>CLUSTER=my-exoscale-cluster
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/$CLUSTER
cp contrib/terraform/exoscale/default.tfvars inventory/$CLUSTER/
cd inventory/$CLUSTER</code></pre><p>Edit <code>default.tfvars</code> and make sure that <code>ceph_partition_size</code> for all the workers is set to 50. <em>(To match the reference setup)</em></p><p>For authentication you can use a encrypted credentials file ~/.cloudstack.ini or ./cloudstack.ini. This file can be created by running:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; cloudstack.ini
[cloudstack]
key = 
secret = 
EOF
sops --encrypt --in-place --pgp  cloudstack.ini
sops cloudstack.ini</code></pre><p>Insert your API key in <code>key</code> and API secret in <code>secret</code>. Follow the <a href="https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoscale IAM Quick-start</a> to learn how to generate API keys.</p><p>To create the cluster, run the following and follow the instructions on the screen.</p><pre><code>terraform init ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale
sops exec-file -no-fifo cloudstack.ini 'CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG={} terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale'</code></pre><p>You should now have a inventory file <code>inventory.ini</code> that you can use with kubespray. To test it and to make sure that all the nodes are properly up and running, run the following:</p><pre><code>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all</code></pre><h3 id="other-setup">Other setup</h3><p>If you are setting up the nodes by yourself, please keep in mind that Exoscale at the time of writing doesn’t have support for adding additional disks. Therefore you need to split the root disk into multiple partitions.</p><p>This can be achieved by making sure that your instance has more than 50GB of disk and that the following lines is added to your user-data before booting.</p><pre><code>#cloud-config
bootcmd:
- [ cloud-init-per, once, move-second-header, sgdisk, --move-second-header, /dev/vda ]
- [ cloud-init-per, once, create-ceph-part, parted, --script, /dev/vda, 'mkpart 2 50GB -1' ] # Create ceph partition spanning from 50GB from start to end</code></pre><p>More information about this can be found in this blog post, <a href="https://elastisys.com/elastisys-engineering-how-to-set-up-rook-with-ceph-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook Ceph on Kubernetes</a>.</p><h3 id="kubespray">kubespray</h3><p>When the infrastructure is up and running, it’s time to add Kubernetes on top of all this. If you have followed the suggested way of spinning up the infrastructure, you should be able to run:</p><pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../cluster.yml -b -v</code></pre><p><em>NOTE: You might want to set the value <code>kubeconfig_localhost</code> in the file <code>group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml</code> to <code>true</code> to get the kubeconfig file. Just remember that it will use the private IP of the server, so update the server IP to match the IP of the control plane load balancer.</em></p><p>When Ansible is finished, verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster by running:</p><pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre><h3 id="rook">Rook</h3><p>Install rook by installing the rook operator chart.</p><pre><code>helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Trying to bring reusable and efficient components to embedded Rust has been a challenge for our team.
We think we've started to make headway, and want to introduce the <code>Drogue Device</code> project.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>A lot of embedded frameworks and RTOSs rely on procedural coding, "copy these source files into your tree" or a lot of manual connection of APIs to the runtime.
Since <em>We Are Red Hat</em> (or IBM, or more specifically/historically "JBoss"), we like reusable components. And frameworks.
They represent guardrails and provide guidance on how to build larger <em>systems</em>, we feel.</p>
<h2 id="component-systems">Component Systems</h2>
<p>In enterprise software, component systems abound. 
There's Enterprise Java Beans, Actix, CDI, Vert.x, Node.js, Akka framework, Quarkus, Spring, etc.
Many of these component systems tend to rely on multi-threading capability of the underlying system, and bring about concurrency issues, such as shared-state and locking.</p>
<h2 id="actor-systems">Actor Systems</h2>
<p>Of these systems, Akka is an <em>actor system</em>, which attempts to draw clear lines about ownership and control of state and data, helping alleviate concurrency concerns.
An actor within an actor system believes that it is single-threaded, serially processing requests that arrive which desire to operate upon the data it controls.
This seemingly single-threaded nature allows an actor to avoid locking of its data. 
All mutations occur from the POV of the actor himself, triggered by <em>message passing</em> from external sources which make requests.</p>
<h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>
<p>Common messaging patterns include <em>fire-and-forget</em> notifications from one component to another, and <em>request/response</em> between two components.
Sometimes components want to ambiguously broadcast messages to whichever unknown components might be interested. 
This third type is basically an <em>event bus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="task-scheduling">Task Scheduling</h2>
<p>An actor that thinks it is single-threaded is great, but our MCUs usually also only have one core, and thus one thread.
A slow actor, or one that blocks the thread of execution can bring the entire system to a halt.
Just because one actor hits a wall and can make no further progress, another actor might be able to do some meaningful work, unblocking the first.</p>
<h3 id="preemptive-task-scheduling">Preemptive Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>If you have a preemptive thread or task scheduler, then a kernel is slicing up processor time. 
An task is given a certain number of cycles (or milliseconds, or reductions or whatever unit measurement used to slice the time pie), and when the 
timer expires, the kernel forcibly pause the task and select another one to run for a slice of time.
Naive implementations will allow a blocked task to continue to block until his time-slice expires.
Other implementations allow a task to indicate that it is blocked, and relinquish any remaining time, cooperatively.</p>
<h3 id="run-to-completion-task-scheduling">Run-to-Completion Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>Some schedulers select a task, and allow it to run to completion, even if it's slow, or blocks briefly. 
The onus is on the developer to ensure his tasks will not completely halt or take too much time. 
Run-to-completion semantics can be great when you have a task you <em>absolutely</em> need to have, well, run to completion before being put into the queue to run again later.</p>
<h3 id="cooperative-task-scheduling">Cooperative Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>A cooperative task scheduler allows a task to <em>run until it can't or doesn't want to run any more</em>.
In this way, the tasks <em>must</em> cooperate. 
A task may have an infinite loop that never completes, and if he doesn't <em>pass</em> or <em>yield</em> control back, will consume 100% of the processor, 100% of the time.
This is a sub-optimal situation.
Cooperative task scheduling can be improved by language support for <em>asynchronous</em> architectures, where the language can implicitly be aware when a task can no longer make progress.
This results in the task being immediately pulled off the active queue, and another <em>ready and waiting</em> task to be selected to do some work.
This doesn't solve the tight-loop problem, where a task must still cooperatively <em>pass</em> control back to the kernel.</p>

<p>Given the above background, along with implementing an untold number of proofs-of-concept, we've selected the following key points for our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor-based: State is held by an actor, accessed/mutated only by that actor, in response to messages.</li>
<li>Cooperative Scheduling: Using Rust's <code>async/await</code> support, actors attempt to be non-blocking and share the processor.</li>
<li>Message-Passing: Support <em>notifications</em>, <em>requests/responses</em>, and an <em>event-bus</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-actors">The Actors</h2>
<p>First, being an actor system, the primary point-of-interest is the <em>actor</em>. 
Drogue Device supports <em>two</em> flavors of actor: Plain Ol' Actors and Interrupt Actors.</p>
<h3 id="plain-ol-actors">Plain Ol' Actors</h3>
<p>The general case of an actor is a component that contains state, and can manipulate it in response to messages.
Their <em>only</em> interface with the outside world is messages. 
To ensure that no other code can directly twiddle an actor, the primary handle on an actor is an <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> instance.
It is through the <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> of an actor <code>A</code> that any part of the system can communicate with the actor.
All methods upon <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> are immutable, and the addresses can be freely <code>clone()</code>'d and shared around.</p>
<p>As noted above, there are two types of message interactions possible with an actor through it's <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code>:</p>
<h4 id="notify">Notify</h4>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub fn </span><span>notify</span><span>&lt;M&gt;(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: M)
</span><span>where
</span><span>    A: NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    M: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    ... elided ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This signature demonstrates a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is ultimately <code>'static</code>-centric.</li>
<li>You can send a message <code>M</code> if the underlying <code>Actor</code> implements the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>notify(...)</code> is a non-blocking synchronous call, meaning that it won't stop the processing and it can be called from any context, sync or async.
It ultimately enqueues the message into a FIFO for the actor. 
Some systems refer to this FIFO as the actor's "inbox".
Messages in the FIFO are indeed processed in a first-in-first-out order.
This also means that the message is <em>not</em> processed immediately upon the call of <code>notify(...)</code>.
This gives this method <em>fire and forget</em> semantics.
The actor will be mostly (see <strong>NB</strong> below)  guaranteed to eventually process the notification, at some point in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>NB:</strong> Currently the FIFO is set to a depth of 16, and if it overflows messages will be silently discarded.
We understand this is sub-optimal. 
The intention is that once <em>const generics</em> are available in stable Rust we will allow per-actor queue depth configuration.
Additionally, we are considering how different overflow strategies may be applied per-actor.</em></p>
<p>On the <code>Actor</code> side, processing is handled through an implementation of the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait, for each type of message that is considered acceptable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub struct </span><span>On;
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Off;

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;On&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    P: OutputPin,
    A: ActiveOutput,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: On) -&gt; Completion {
        ... elided ...
    }
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;Off&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    P: OutputPin,
    A: ActiveOutput,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: Off) -&gt; Completion {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h4 id="request">Request</h4>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to have a somewhat synchronous interactino with an actor in an <em>request/response</em> type of cycle.
The <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> type also provides that capability:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>request</span><span>&lt;M&gt;(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: M) -&gt; &lt;A as RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;&gt;::Response
</span><span>where
</span><span>    A: RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    M: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    ... elided ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first thing to note is that because <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> is a <em>type</em> and not a <em>trait</em>, it can indeed support <code>async</code> methods.
The second thing to note is that <code>request(...)</code> <strong>is</strong> an <code>async</code> method.
Upon calling this method, a <code>Future</code> is ultimately returned, and the called <em>must</em> <code>.await</code> the response, per usual Rust async semantics.</p>
<p>It is the async nature of this method that allows actors to talk to other actors and remain non-blocking and cooperatively schedulable.</p>
<p>As with the <code>notify(...)</code> method, this method is also considered immutable, and uses the underlying actor's FIFO.
The same FIFO is shared between all types of messages that an actor can be notified or requested.</p>
<p>On the <code>Actor</code> side, as with the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code>, there is a <code>RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait to be implemented for each type of request an actor needs to be able to handle.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub struct </span><span>Lock;

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; RequestHandler&lt;Lock&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Mutex&lt;T&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    T: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    </span><span>type </span><span>Response = Exclusive&lt;T&gt;;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_request</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: Lock) -&gt; Response&lt;</span><span>Self::</span><span>Response&gt; {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="interrupt-actors">Interrupt Actors</h3>
<p>Extending on the Plain Ol' Actors are Interrupt actors, which in addition to doing all the things an actor can do, <em>also</em> is cognizant and connected to hardware interrupts.
Interrupts are special, because they can arrive at any time, and they are not initiated as a message from another actor.
So interrupts are treated somewhat specially.</p>
<p>An interrupt firing can be considered a special type of message, without content. 
To that end, the <code>Interrupt</code> trait brings one more method to implement: <code>on_interrupt(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span><span>&lt;D, PIN&gt; Interrupt </span><span>for </span><span>Button&lt;D, PIN&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    D: Device + EventHandler&lt;ButtonEvent&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    PIN: InputPin + ExtiPin,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_interrupt</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="message-handling-and-async">Message-handling and <code>async</code></h2>
<p>Since Drogue Device attempts to provide guardrails for performing asynchronous operations where possible, but Rust doesn't currently support <code>async</code> in traits,
you may have noticed that all of the aforementioned <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> and <code>RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> methods were not, at all, <code>async</code>.
Additionally, their return value in the signatures may have appeared slightly odd.
Also, each method takes a <code>&amp;'static mut self</code> reference. 
It's <code>`static</code> because the system is static, and Futures work best with <code>`static`</code>. 
It's <code>&amp;mut</code> because the scheduler guarantees that the actor's methods are serialized and ensures that a given handler is the only reference (mutable or not) 
for the actor at any given point in time.
This allows the actor to free, without locks, mutate his own state.</p>
<h3 id="on-notify"><code>on_notify</code></h3>
<p>Let's look at the <em>fire-and-forget</em> <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> on an actor.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>m…</span></code></pre></section></div>

    <p>As the fallout of the <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">FSFE stalking scandal continues</a>, we are publishing below the leaked FSFE diversity strategy.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights we identified:</p>

<blockquote><em>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</em></blockquote>

<p>What is the real reason women don't want their name and picture on the FSFE web site?</p>

<blockquote><em>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).</em></blockquote>

<p>FSFE's biggest event is LLW but it is never advertised.  The registration process and the Call for Papers are hidden from the former Fellows and the Supporters.  Women will not participate in other Free Software events as long as the biggest events, like LLW, are hidden in the shadows.</p>

<blockquote><em>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women.</em></blockquote>

<p>Women employed as interns, men employed on permanent contracts.  As the recent court case demonstrates, all women on permanent contracts were <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">sacked for talking about equality</a>.  What Matthias Kirschner describes is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch">Untermensch concept from the Third Reich</a>.  This isn't the first time <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/matthias-kirschner-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/">we find Kirschner's conduct is close to that of the Third Reich</a>.</p>

</em></blockquote>

<p>Why would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga Gkotsopoulou</a>, a woman from Greece, want to continue working for Free after her paid German internship ends?  Why would a woman in Greece want to send money to a misogynist in Berlin?  What will this Greek money be used for, hiring more female interns in Kirschner's cramped little office?</p>

<p>Kirschner appears to be delusional about his obligation to pay people.  An internship is a contract that ensures the woman can never acquire maternity rights, the contract always finishes before they can become pregnant.  Women resent this.</p>

<blockquote><em>### In Progress

</em><ul><em>
</em><li><em> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
<ul>
 <li>Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
  <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that)</li>
</ul>
</em></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>This was the only definite action from the strategy, another Code of Conduct.  The way Kirschner <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">went to this woman's home</a> demonstrates the reality of the Code of Conduct: leaders of open source organizations see themselves as God, they can do whatever they want and only apply their "enforcement" venom to their political rivals.</p>

<p>Subject: Re: diversity and expanding the GA<br>
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:51:58 +0000<br>
From: Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org><br>
To: ga@fsfeurope.org</mk@fsfe.org></p>

<p>Dear GA members,

</p><p>thank you all for raising your points in this thread. As Hugo pointed
out we repeatedly had that discussion, and also worked on some points.
Still there were some new ideas in the thread and from the Council we
suggest a few action items to make further progress. But first, so that
everybody is on the same page, some examples of existing activities on
that topic.,/p&gt;

</p><p>## Some examples of what we already do/did

</p><ul>
<li>When we have pictures on our website we try to have equal wo/man on
 them. For example have a look at
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html (this
 year we had some additions, before IIRC the ratio was better).</li>

<li>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</li>
<li>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).
 Although we have the same problem most conferences have, that is is
 really difficult to achieve that.</li>

<li>For the Legal Network council we started by picking the same ratio
 with men as with women.</li>

<li>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women. One reason is
 also because becoming intern is also increasing the chance to become
 an employment in the Free Software area.
 (https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html says "We want more
 women to be involved in Free Software. That's why we will give
 preference to applications from suitably qualified female
 candidates.")</li>

<li> As with males we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek
   deputy coordinator.</li>
 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>
 <li>We work a lot with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Eszter+Bako+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Eszter</a>, who is now assistent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Reda">Julia Reda</a>, but
   it might be difficult to include her further at the moment.</li>
 <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Lusy+Vaseva+fsfe">Lusy</a>
is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul></li>

<li>Staff was following-up with proposals from the past. For example
 Patrick Ohnewein before proposed Sonia Montegiove. Matthias had
 several talks with her and invited her to the FSFE summit. The problem
 is that she is quite shy when speaking English.</li>
<li>This year we had a
moderations workshop for our staff. Before it we
 clarified with the trainer that one of our goals is to enable our
 staff running more inclusive meetings. The workshop was documented in
 the wiki https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/Moderation (some permission
 problem at the moment, hope it is soon fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>## Next Steps</p>

<p>### In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
 <ul>
 <li> Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
 <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>### Possible actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion with Ulrike about the topic. She studied gender studies and
 is very interested in the topic) about the topic. Together with her
 identify strategies for more diversity inside the FSFE community and
 the GA, by</li>
<ul>
<li>having a budget for counselling on diversity (as several
people
   pointed out, just because someone is a women in IT, does not know
   they know about diversity).</li>
<li> have a time budget for Ulrike to
help on this issue next year.</li>

<li> As some hesitate to just add women to the GA without first being
 involved in other areas, make it a priority to support already active
 or interested females (or other under represented groups).  * This
could include that we encourage them to join us in teams, and
   mentor them, or to invite them to events so we can meet them (could
   also include priority for travel funding in case we have to choose).
</li></ul>

<li>GA participation:
<ul><li>You might have realised that all our male
staffers are GA members,
   but none of our female staffers is. That is bad. We should encourage
   Polina and Ulrike to think about joining, too.</li>
 <li>Depending on the outcome of the FSFE2020 discussion: if we enlarge
   the council (as the FSFE board) introduce a quote there (as Daniel
   proposed to have a second VP position, with a requirement that at
   least one of the VP positions must not be male.)</li>
 <li>Depending on the Italian GA member's feedback, we could invite her
   as a guest to the next GA, or if they think it would be a good idea
   we can ask her to first become another coordinator for Italy as a
   first step.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html starts with a quote by
 a former male and female interns. But we should update one of the
 quotes by Erik or Hugo on that page with former quotes.</li>

<li>Make sure we have balanced quotes by women on our website / as well as
 the front page. E.g.
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.en.html (either
 get more or think about removing this page for next years in the
 campaign)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Matthias</p>

		<!-- .post-header -->


		<div>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While this post is addressed to F# .NET developers, it introduces much wider concepts starting from hardware architecture to overall .NET runtime and JIT compiler optimizations. It shouldn't be a surprise - optimizing the application performance requires us to understand the relationships between our high level code and what actually happens on the hardware.</p>
<p>There's a popular opinion that F# code must be slower than equivalent C# code. This opinion is mostly false, however it comes with some rationale. Usually comparison doesn't use <strong>equivalent</strong> code in both languages, and F# is generally more high level and declarative in nature. "Idiomatic" F# code doesn't always play well with .NET virtual machine. Writing code that is high level, declarative and fast on .NET platform is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In the examples below we'll use some common tools that will help us get better insight into nature of F# code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharplab.io/">Sharplab</a> allows us to easily inspect generated JIT intermediate representation, assembly or even equivalent C# code (which sometimes is approximate, since not all IL idioms are representable in C#) for a given F# snippet. For assembly code usually some extra mangling with params may be necessary for code to be generated as SharpLab sometimes cannot introspect F# core lib code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector">Object Layout Inspector</a> lets us see how structs and classes will actually be represented in memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html">BenchmarkDotNet</a> is very popular library for writing micro benchmarks. We'll use it to show heap allocations and execution times of our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>A correct profiling of the executing application is crucial before starting any work on optimizing the code - there's no sense in shaving last possible CPU cycles out of the function that's executed for 0.1% of the time.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for most day-to-day business applications, first way to solve performance problems is to reduce obvious mistakes (eg. replacing multiple I/O requests with one, writing more efficient database query etc.). If that was not the case, next step for satisfactory solution can be simply writing more imperative code - to make it easier to reason about for the compiler rather than human - or picking better-suited data structures. This is especially prevalent in F#, where we can observe pervasive usage of types like <code>'t list</code> (tip: if you're looking which collection to use and want good performance, F# list is almost never a good answer). Here we're about to go deeper, into area where we're about to compete with the prefabricated data types and algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="understandmemorylayoutofvaluetypes">Understand memory layout of value types</h2>
<p>One of the big performance gains, that .NET runtime uses to take advantage over other managed virtual machines (like JVM) in race for ultimate performance, often comes from using value types. So if we're about to go fast, we first need to understand how they work.</p>
<p>.NET structs represent types, which are not allocated separately on the managed memory heap, but rather inlined within the containing scope (instance of the class in case of fields, thread stack for variables, etc.). This means that usually they are cheaper and easier to access in high-allocation scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/content/images/2021/02/class-vs-struct-layout.png" alt="class-vs-struct-layout"></p>
<p>Historically, F# code was not very promising, when it comes to utilizing value types. Nowadays we got things like struct tuples - <code>struct('a * 'b)</code> which unfortunately are not widely used in F# even though in practice they should be preferable choice when working with tuples - and <code>[&lt;Struct&gt;]</code> attribute, that can be used on records and discriminated unions (we'll return to them later), making use of them became much more feasible.</p>
<p>However this doesn't necessarily mean, that replacing all reference types with value types will make our code magically go faster. In fact, this may be quite opposite. Why? Imagine what happens when we want to pass a record as a parameter. How is it done? Usually passing object to a function happens by copying reference to that object, which is either 4B or 8B depending on our OS being x86 or x64, and therefore fits perfectly into standard CPU register.</p>
<pre><code>type A() =
  class
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let print (value: 't) = System.Console.WriteLine(value.ToString())

let a = A() // sub rsp, 0x28
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d1a8
            // call 0x00007ff9730aade0 ; allocate A on the heap
print a     // mov rdx, rax            ; copy reference to a to the stack
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d5f8
            // call _.print[[System.__Canon, System.Private.CoreLib]](System.__Canon)
</code></pre>
<p>Now what if we're using structs? For reference types we copy object's reference on the stack - since reference is just a single address, it always can fit into register and be done within a single operation. For value types, we copy entire value instead. If they don't fit into register, we'll have to copy them over in multiple steps.</p>
<pre><code>type B =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let b = B() // sub rsp, 0x38
            // xor eax, eax       ; zero field b.x
            // xor ecx, ecx       ; zero field b.y
            // xor edx, edx       ; zero field b.z
print b     // lea r8, [rsp+0x28]
            // mov [r8], ecx      ; copy field b.x to the stack
            // mov [r8+4], eax    ; copy field b.y to the stack
            // mov [r8+8], edx    ; copy field b.z to the stack
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+B, _]](B)
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these steps is a machine instruction that takes time to execute. However, sometimes .NET can optimize that - pointer-sized registers are not only ones available in modern machines. We also have a special purpose SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) ones, that are much bigger and can be used as long as passed data fits into them perfectly.</p>
<pre><code>type C =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable zz: int
  end
  
let c = C() // sub rsp, 0x48
            // xor eax, eax             ; zero register
            // mov [rsp+0x38], rax      ; init fields b.x and b.y together with zero'ed register
            // mov [rsp+0x40], rax      ; init fields b.z and b.zz together with zero'ed register
print c     // vmovupd xmm0, [rsp+0x38] ; copy all 4 fields together on the stack using SIMD registers
            // vmovupd [rsp+0x28], xmm0
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C)
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing available in .NET, that allows us addressing inefficiencies of passing structs as arguments are so called by-ref parameters. There are 3 types of these, marked using <code>'t inref</code>, <code>'t outref</code>  and <code>'t byref</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let print(value: 't inref) = ...
let c = C()
print &amp;c // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28] ; copy address of the struct head onto the stack
         // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C ByRef)
</code></pre>
<p>Please, don't confuse by-ref parameters with <code>ref</code> data type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'a ref</code> is actually an alias for <code>Ref&lt;'a&gt;</code> class, therefore allocated on the heap and passed by reference. In general, using this class in F# very rarely has sense (outside of writing exemplar, idiomatic code).</li>
<li><code>'a byref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>ref</code> parameter tag - it means that we're passing reference (memory address) to an object or struct. It expects it to be initialized and can be used to change the contents of the underlying value. For this reason F# requires fields and variables passed as <code>byref</code> to be declared with <code>mutable</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>'a outref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>out</code> parameter tag - it always must be initialized by the end of the function body. This may sound a bit tricky as F# doesn't put that requirement explicitly. If we didn't make that assignment in any of the code branches, F# compiler will simply initialize it for us with default value (just like using <code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;_&gt;</code>), which sometimes may lead to null reference exceptions.</li>
<li><code>'a inref</code> is the youngest of these and is equivalent of C# <code>in</code> parameter - while in C# structs passed as arguments for that parameters don't have to be tagged,  F# will always require to mark passing by ref (using <code>&amp;</code> prefix for passed argument) for any parameter marked with <code>byref</code>/<code>inref</code>/<code>outref</code>. <code>inref</code> is basically an optimization technique for what we saw above - it allows us to pass struct into a function using only its memory address, without copying entire struct contents. Additionally <code>inref</code> says that parameter is treated as read only, so it cannot be modified inside of function body. .NET JIT can utilize this information in some cases to reduce number of safety checks, therefore reducing number of instructions to be executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While using by-ref parameters is usually good idea when it comes to writing code targeting complex value types, there are several limitations to it.</p>
<p>One is that arguments passed using by-ref params cannot be captured by closures/lambdas/anonymous functions, which prevents them from being used in more abstract code:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  [1..10]
  |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x + a) // `a` is captured by closure, which is compilation error
  
// RIGHT
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  let mutable result = []
  for x=10 downto 1 do
    result &lt;- (x + a)::result
  result
</code></pre>
<p>This includes problems even for common inlined functions like eg. pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code>. That's the price, we have to pay for speed (at least for now).</p>
<p>Second issue is that, at the moment by-ref parameters cannot be involved in building nested functions (regardless if they capture the values from function in outer scope or not). This again makes very inconvenient to use them in cases like tail recursive loop pattern:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: 'a) =
  let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) = // this nested function won't compile
    if n = 0 then ()
    else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  loop 100 &amp;a

// RIGHT
let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) =
  if n = 0 then ()
  else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  
let doSomething (a: …</code></pre></div></article></div>

<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>



<p><em>Note: this was edited in after the fact. I meant to include it in the original.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>Brain iron dyshomeostasis with iron accumulation is a known feature of brain aging. 
The cause of this iron accumulation is aging is unknown, but the immune system is less active in older people, and as viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in aging host tissues.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220280/">has been proposed several times</a> that metal dyshomeostasis could be an underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation and progression of the pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor and extra-motor symptoms of ALS.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33491917/">new paper proposes</a> an update of the iron hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), based on large scale emerging evidence.</p>

<p>Iron featured historically early in Alzheimer's disease research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream Alzheimer's disease research.</p>

<p>Much of the effort investigating iron in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy through increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation.</p>

<p>The authors provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range are associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology.</p>

<p>These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.</p>

<p>A substantial body of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513737/">preclinical evidence and early clinical data</a> has demonstrated that deferoxamine and other iron chelators have strong disease-modifying impacts in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke. Acting by the disease-nonspecific pathway of iron chelation, deferoxamine targets each of these complex diseases via multifactorial mechanisms.</p>

<p>Deferiprone another iron chelator <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Amyotrophic%20Lateral%20Sclerosis&amp;term=chelator&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search">is tested in clinical trials against ALS</a> in France’s Lille CHU hospital.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they're offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

                            <p>This article aims to provide a fair and thorough comparison of the current private messaging apps in terms of their privacy, security, and anonymity†. However, it must be abundantly clear that this post is written by Status (one of the above messengers). We strongly encourage you to verify our sources, do your own due diligence, and correct us if we are wrong.</p><p><em>†For the purposes of simplicity for the average reader, anonymity will be defined as a complete dissociation of one's chat identity and their true identity.</em></p><h2 id="signal"><strong>Signal</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-signal-servers-see">What can Signal servers see?</h3><p>Not much. Your messages, attachments, calls, sender metadata, group chats and group metadata are all end-to-end encrypted. However, Signal (and Amazon) can infer who talks to who with a fair degree of accuracy by analyzing the network traffic. Signal is the only entity that runs the Signal servers, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/">they host all such servers on Amazon Web Services</a>. Here is a simple breakdown of what the network traffic could look like if Alice (1.1.1.1) sent a message to Bob (2.2.2.2):</p><p><strong>08:23:02</strong> — IP Address 1.1.1.1 sends 512 bytes to Signal's server.</p><p><strong>08:23:04</strong> — IP Address 2.2.2.2 receives 512 bytes from Signal's server.</p><p>This is what Jeff Bezos can see. Now, this, on its own, doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is talking to Bob. It could just be a coincidence — Bob happened to receive a different and entirely unrelated packet two seconds after Alice sent one of equal size.</p><p>However, if this coincidence were to happen, ten, twenty or a hundred times, with packets of equal sizes going back and forth from Alice and Bob, it would soon become apparent that these two IP addresses are likely talking to each other. At this point, one simply has to ask the respective Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast or AT&amp;T) who is behind a given IP address to uncover their legal identity.</p><p>So basically, Jeff Bezos can know who you talk to on Signal with a fair degree of accuracy via traffic analysis. This can be done even without Signal's cooperation, as Amazon has direct access to all incoming and outgoing traffic on the centralized Signal servers. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nj3YFprqAr8?t=2034">acknowledged this flaw in the Q&amp;A session</a> of his 36C3 talk "The ecosystem is moving."</p><p>If Signal were to cooperate in such traffic analysis attacks, it would become much easier, as Signal does have access to the recipient metadata (<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">but not sender metadata</a>). In other words, they can see who the envelope is addressed to, but not who it came from. This, in addition to the traffic analysis, would allow Signal to infer nearly all the sender/recipient metadata, in addition to some of the group metadata.</p><h3 id="is-signal-anonymous">Is Signal anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, Signal will leak your IP address to your contacts that call you by default (you can change this in the settings by enabling the option "Always Relay Calls"). Signal also has the technical capability of associating your IP address and your Signal account (<a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">but they probably don't do this</a>). This means that even a burner number isn't enough for total anonymity if you assume the Signal servers are malicious or compromised.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that Signal has never claimed to be an anonymous tool. These points do not detract from the fact that they do care about your privacy — they are simply approaching it in a different manner.</p><h3 id="is-signal-easy-to-shut-down">Is Signal easy to shut down?</h3><p>If you don't have any faith in the US government, the answer is yes. If you do, the answer is probably not. Signal is the sole operator of the Signal servers, and they are based in the United States. There is no federation, and there is no peer-to-peer architecture. If Signal is legally compelled to shut down their servers, that's it. All forms of communication through Signal would immediately halt. However, the likelihood of such an event is debatable, and will be left to the reader.</p><p>It would be very difficult to quickly move Signal to a different jurisdiction, as they have thus far operated under the assumption that the US will not ban them. Moxie Marlinspike lives in the US, as does the overwhelming majority of Signal's employees, and their only two legal entities <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">were incorporated in the US</a>. In addition, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Signal themselves could shut down Signal (this may seem obvious, but certain decentralized architectures prevent even the creator of something from shutting it down, such as Bitcoin).</p><hr><h2 id="telegram"><strong>Telegram</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-telegram-servers-see">What can Telegram servers see?</h3><p>Basically everything. They can see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/710344/psa-telegram-chats-arent-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default/">every message you've ever sent in a group chat</a>, most of your 1:1 conversations (not secret chats), all your contacts, your profile picture and your bio. They know who you talk to, and at what time (even if it's a secret chat!). They know the members, name, and icon of every single group (including private ones) .</p><p>This may sound completely contrary to what Telegram says. The reason is that Telegram fundamentally operates on a different trust model. They assume that you trust Telegram, but not the government.</p><p>Telegram splits up their encryption keys and stores the separate pieces in several different jurisdictions. In theory, this means that all of the jurisdictions used by Telegram would have to cooperate in order to obtain any user data. They claim this has allowed them to <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests">not release a single byte of user data</a>. These claims, by their very nature, are unverifiable, and require that you trust Telegram. If that's good enough for you, use Telegram.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-anonymous">Is Telegram anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust Telegram, then Telegram can be anonymous, as you are given the option hide your phone number and use a username of your choice. If you don't trust Telegram, it is not anonymous in any way, as they will have your phone number and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#5-2-safety-and-security">they can see your IP address</a>.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-easy-to-shut-down">Is Telegram easy to shut down?</h3><p>Probably not. Telegram intentionally set up its legal structure to be agile and resistant to overreaching governments. If Dubai (<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#8-2-telegrams-group-companies">their current jurisdiction</a>) bans them, they would likely move to another. Dubai is a flag of convenience for Telegram. However, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Telegram themselves could shut down Telegram.</p><hr><h2 id="whatsapp"><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-whatsapp-servers-see">What can WhatsApp servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private group, the group icon, the group name, and which members are the administrators of said group. But your messages, pictures, attachments, status updates and calls are all end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages has been repeatedly compromised through <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/04/whatsapp-backups-android/">unencrypted Google or iCloud backups</a>. Although these backups are technically optionally, they are repeatedly suggested to the user with a coercive user interface. Even if you do not enable these backups, there is a good chance your conversation partner did, which compromises the integrity of the end-to-end encryption for both of you.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-anonymous">Is WhatsApp anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">logs your IP address</a> and directly associates it with your chat identity.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-easy-to-shut-down">Is WhatsApp easy to shut down?</h3><p>Not really, given the scale of Facebook and the nature of public corporations. However, it is very likely that WhatsApp could be forced to include a backdoor into their clients. There would be no way around this, as the clients are all proprietary. With all other messaging apps in this list, one could simply download the code prior to the backdoor, build it, and run that version of the client which still correctly encrypts the messages. Decentralized messaging architectures such as Status or Matrix would be even more resilient against such coercion, as there would be no central servers to shut down.</p><hr><h2 id="matrix"><strong>Matrix</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-federated-matrix-servers-see">What can federated Matrix servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, your private room aliases, your device names, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private room, the room icon, the room name, and which members are the administrators of said room. They can see who talks and when in private rooms. But your messages, pictures and files are all end-to-end encrypted by default.</p><p>Although some homeserver implementations have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4565#issuecomment-540320761">stopped storing this metadata by default</a>, all homeservers still have the technical ability to access it. Some of these metadata issues may be resolved with the latest developments in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix</a>, but it is unclear as to whether or not this will be effective in regards to room metadata such as membership or administrator privileges.</p><p>It should be noted that the relative ease of hosting your own Matrix server diminishes the value of any metadata leaks. If all of your contacts use a Matrix server that you trust (which could be one that you host), it doesn't matter if the server can see this metadata. However, in practice, most people just use someone else's server (such as the matrix.org one).</p><h3 id="is-matrix-anonymous">Is Matrix anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust the federated homeserver you are connected to not to disclose your IP address, you are anonymous. If not, you are not anonymous, as the homeserver you connect to will be able to directly associate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/f31f8e63198cfe46af48d788dbb294aba9155e5a/synapse/storage/databases/main/schema/delta/16/users.sql#L42">your chat identity and IP</a>.</p><p>Although it technically is possible to host a Matrix homeserver as an anonymous Tor onion service, it is highly impractical to do so as the process has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7088">yet to be streamlined</a>.</p><h3 id="is-matrix-easy-to-shut-down">Is Matrix easy to shut down?</h3><p>No. It would be practically impossible to entirely shut Matrix down. The Matrix Foundation cannot shut down Matrix. However, significant damage could be done given the current points of centralization. First, if the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>2019-02-13</p>
</header>
<p><strong>See also: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1616925913">Flash cards (Anki deck) for memorization</a></strong></p>
<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>f</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>(same as G)</td>

<tr>
<td>m</td>
<td>SGR</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>For practice, you might try interpreting the following string:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[3A\x1b[4D\x1b[shello\x1b[J\x1b[1;3Hworld\x1b[u\x1b[13T</code></pre>
<h3 id="sgr">SGR</h3>
<p>The SGR (“Select Graphics Rendition”) function (<code>m</code>) has a much more complex signature than the other functions. An—again, abridged—guide to SGR arguments:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>100–107</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

<p>February 2021</p>

<p>Last week’s GameStop (GME) speculative frenzy stirred a motley crew  of Redditors, politicians, and venture capitalists, each using the volatility to push their preferred narratives. <em>Evil hedge funds are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">propping up their buddies</a> and astroturfing misinformation. Market makers are evil for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000">profiting off retail order flow</a>. Robinhood has forsaken its namesake and is in cahoots with the aforementioned parties.</em> There are plenty of villains in this story, or none at all, depending on your view of the financial industry.</p>

<p>The real answer to why Robinhood restricted trading on GME turned out to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/business/us-economy-coronavirus#robinhood-needed-3-billion-to-cover-risky-trades-its-chief-told-elon-musk">far more mundane</a>. To recap, settlement of stock trades takes multiple days, and in the meantime, the clearinghouses that facilitate trades for brokers require that some collateral be placed to account for risk that the buyer or seller does not fulfill their side of the trade. Since this risk increases with stock volatility, clearinghouses demanded $3 billion collateral from Robinhood to account for their users holding GME, a meme stock that was routinely seeing +/- 50% swings but threatened to crash to earth at any moment. Robinhood was forced to deal with the imminent liquidity challenge by raising emergency funding. In the meantime, to manage risk, they placed limits on purchasing GME shares. So goes the story recounted by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev (or as Elon Musk called him, “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184">Vlad the stock impaler</a>”).</p>

<p>Yet this surface-level explanation likely leaves the observant investor with more questions. <em>Okay, so plausibly if we’re trading on margin, Robinhood could face a liquidity crunch. But what’s the problem if we’re trading using our own settled cash?</em> Cash trades need to settle and we have to put down collateral to insure against risk in the meantime. <em>That’s no problem, the internet enables us to process transactions quickly, right?</em> No, it takes two days. <em>Why does it take two days?</em> Transactions are processed at night in batches. <em>Fine then, can’t you use the money we just put up as collateral?</em> You can’t use client funds for that purpose. <em>Why not? Wait, wouldn’t this all be a non-issue if trades cleared near-instantly? Isn’t this a self-imposed problem within the financial industry?</em></p>

<p>Indeed, this doesn’t seem to be how we would design the system from first principles. As it turns out, Robinhood’s liquidity incident only exposes the surface of deeper troubles in fintech. Underneath a world of seamless consumer transacting represented by Robinhood, Venmo, and other apps of their generation lies an underbelly of interconnected financial systems that struggle to meet modern demands. Fintech’s attempts at abstracting away such complexity run into challenges when long-tail events occur, leaving customers frustrated and institutions in danger. A firmer foundational infrastructure from the Fed involving features like open banking, instant P2P payments, and real-time trade settlement (update: <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement">Robinhood themselves called for this now!</a>) would allow us to build a more robust layer of services while minimizing rent-seeking middlemen. <strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-abstractions-fail">When Abstractions Fail</h2>

<p>Software engineers define leaky abstractions as when underlying implementation details of a process, meant to be hidden away, become relevant as things fail. From this perspective, Robinhood manifested <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction that was not simply leaking but gushing out from every news report</strong> and flooding investors’ brokerage accounts. By hiding the details of a complex settlement process and marking sale proceeds as immediately available to a customer, Robinhood presents a simplified trading process to customers while handling the settlement and margin details behind the scenes. It all works well until some Redditors decide to send a stock to the moon and your platform bears the brunt, I guess. In any case upon discovery of a software bug, it’s an all-too-familiar experience to realize a certain library call isn’t working, and find yourself having to dig further and further into the annals of ancient source code down the chain to figure out where something went wrong.</p>

<p>Since you were never intended to dig this far (you’d never need to, right?), they sure won’t make it easy to dig down there, with obfuscated binaries, hidden state effects, and other nasty monsters of the underworld. Likewise, delving into the GME situation is a hopeless exercise for an average investor who, faced with a sudden message of “trading suspended”, rationally wants to get to the bottom of this. They would quickly find a wall of opaque financial rules with regards to the clearing process that seem to exist on a “need to know’’ basis. If Vlad the CEO himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7X2dsW_Xw">“doesn’t quite know how the formula works”</a>, what hope does the average citizen have to track down the source of this seeming bug in the system? Perhaps we should all just give up, raise pitchforks against Citadel, and call it a day.</p>

<p>The financial world is not new to abstractions, of course. Almost any tangible object or collection of intangibles has been securitized, packaged into new securities, tranched once or twice for good measure, and repackaged - repeat until satisfied. New engineered securities are then available for boomer 401k portfolios, sovereign wealth funds, and anyone else who wants in from the peripheries. These abstractions, in their defense, have usually made the markets in which they’re employed <a href="http://www.oeconomia.actapol.net/pub/9_3_181.pdf">far more efficient and liquid</a>. Mortgage-backed securities, as much as they were maligned for their role in precipitating the Great Recession, made it dramatically easier for cash-strapped homebuyers in North Carolina to be matched up with someone on the other side of the world looking to [in theory] buy a bunch of uncorrelated assets (we all know how that ended though) for their investment portfolio. In exchange for the hard work and research that goes into assembling these securities, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/">financial middlemen wages have shot up dramatically since 1970</a> against a backdrop of broader economic inequality.</p>

<p>But <strong>abstractions are only useful when they’re built upon a well-designed foundation of primitives</strong>. When abstractions are instead used as patches over flimsy Swiss cheese layers of infrastructure, they’re bound to go wrong and leak, making their presence known to the world at the most inopportune time. Like, say, when GME is attempting to go to the moon but passengers are getting ejected for mysterious reasons. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> asserts that “All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.” Assuming the truth of this statement, building unnecessary layers of complex abstractions compounds the risk for no good return.</p>

<h2 id="fintechs-stopgap-unicorns">Fintech’s Stopgap Unicorns</h2>

<p>The brave new world of fintech software consists of many such abstractions that really ought not to exist in an ideal world with better financial infrastructure. It’s a classic American story of governmental inaction and private opportunists seeking to fill the gap, providing acceptable service and pocketing some hefty middleman profits in the meantime. The existence of these entrenched middlemen further dampens any political interest in solving root causes of central dysfunction, and so the cycle is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Take Venmo for example. Nations around the world have begun setting up open banking APIs for peer-to-peer payments and other services by legally mandating interconnectability. The European Union’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive">Revised Payment Services Directive</a> went into effect in 2018 putting Europe at the forefront of open banking initiatives. Supporting payments is a core function that makes a bank a bank, and in the 21st century, those payments occur over the internet and so we expect instant deposits. Instead, if we rely on existing open standards for payment in the US, ie. ACH deposits, it seems the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/ach-transfers">fastest we can do is a few business days</a> or pay up for expensive wire transfers. And conveniently those are extra days where funds are in limbo mean that banks can earn some extra interest.</p>

<p>The US has taken a market-driven approach to hoping for more interconnectedness between banks, resulting in Zelle, a P2P payment system created by a bank consortium that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/business/zelle-banks-fraud.html">is sometimes secure</a>. Meanwhile Venmo has the first-mover advantage in the P2P payment space, and has built out a formidable network of users in a domain where implicit trust in identities is critical. Don’t like those options? You’re also free to use Messenger Pay, Apple Pay, CashApp, among a myriad set of options. Clearly, the fragmentation is killing us here, making what intuitively wants to be a well-designed protocol a mess of walled gardens with varying functionality. These days, it’s hard to even grasp how protocols like email, or heck even USPS mail, ever came to fruition against the alternative crop of self-interested ecosystems.</p>

<p>Venmo won by building an abstracted network that appears to support instant peer-to-peer payments based just on a username. Underneath, of course, it rarely arranges for any bank transfers at all, and simply adjusts numbers in a database until a user actually wants to cash out. In the meantime, parent company PayPal can enjoy <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/20/what-are-apps-venmo-doing-your-money/">the returns on idle capital</a> chilling in user wallets. This middleman profit, along with various fees for third-party integrations, seems like a fair concession for the services provided. But it gets worse: <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/venmo-dark-patterns">Venmo is filled with dark patterns</a> that try to encourage you to share as much financial data as possible with them and others, in vague hopes of building “a social network” since apparently that’s the only end game allowed in the Valley. Perhaps outsourcing critical financial functions to growth-hungry companies with flimsy morals wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p>

<p>Plaid is another example of a Silicon Valley fintech darling filling in a gap resulting from our lack of an interbank API. Plaid allows users to connect bank accounts to other apps by logging into bank accounts on users’ behalf and scraping relevant data. Again, it’s easy to spot the …</p></section></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Writing tests today sucks. Tests are expensive to write. They're even more
expensive to maintain. They're somewhat opaque to anybody who's not intimately
familiar with the test harness. You can't always be sure whether you're writing
the “right” tests for your situation. Worst of all, it's sometimes difficult to
persuade a non-technical stakeholder that software testing actually does
anything underneath the hood, except maybe inflate operational expenses for your
software budget. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941">Every software development horror
story</a> I've heard comes with some
discussion around tests, and that's because not only does software fail in more
ways than anybody without job security may care to admit, it fails in novel and
unpredictable manners.</p>
<p>What sucks even more is <em>just how important effective software testing is</em> for
software engineers to quickly and confidently contribute value. The absolute
first thing I do after cloning most <code>git</code> repositories these days, for work or
otherwise, is run the test suite. Test suites are self-documenting and always
more accurate than a wiki or other forms of documentation, and since they're
programmatic it's much easier to tie into the rest of your developer workflow
(say when setting up automated deployments to production).</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, this probably isn't news to you if you've been working in industry for
a while, and it's easy to fall into a trap of powerlessness and believing any
endemic lack of alignment is eternal. And while it's not always (and usually
not) the fault of technical limitations, it may be useful to think of technical
ways to grow beyond the immediate problem. So I'd like to say there are two
great aspects about professional software that could be applied to software
testing.</p>
<p>The first is we're usually using paradigms that are decades old. Professional
software is usually incremental in action and incrementalist in thinking. This
implies there's often new concepts in academia or research that might solve
current problems. One professor I talked to around graduation 4 years ago
brought up how the A* path-finding algorithm was invented 20 years before its
adoption in the video game industry (and apparently that's at least one reason
why NPCs don't collide with in-world walls anymore).</p>
<p>The second is test suites usually under the full control of engineering. There
might be a QA department within engineering, but I have yet to see a
sales/marketing department care deeply about how you structure a test harness,
vs. the layout of a landing page. While serving the company is the goal of any
business-oriented engineering department, this means there's more agency than
usual in how engineering approaches testing, than say product implementation or
devops.</p>
<p>What we're looking for as software engineers is to write as many good tests as
possible within some limited time frame.</p>
<h2 id="different-software-testing-strategies-ive-used">Different software testing strategies I've used</h2>
<p>The most important thing about writing good tests is to start writing good
source code and develop good habits. This might involve separating concerns in a
codebase by using functions instead of classes, gradually applying type
signatures using <code>mypy</code> or <code>pyre-check</code> and adding a typechecking step to your
CI pipeline, and paying attention to software properties like immutability
(updating an object creates a copy of the object with the update instead of
mutating the original object) and idempotency (running a code block generates
the same output for the same input even for multiple runs). You can bring a lot
of value to the table by using tools + infrastructure like <code>black</code> for
autoformatting and Docker / <code>docker-compose</code> for running local infrastructure,
and a lot of this undergirds higher-order testing strategies like property-based
testing later on.</p>
<p>Some of these strategies I've applied in the field revolve around these simpler
ideas. When I'm building a webapp frontend or backend, I adopted the idea of
“functional core, imperative shell”, where you have a soup of decoupled methods
within your app that are easily unit testable, and a set of well-defined I/O
interfaces and stubs to imperative resources like your network or database to
create the cheapest possible integration tests. This is nice for stateless,
pass-through entities, but works less well when you're primarily looking for
effects (e.g. it'd be very difficult to unit test most of PostgreSQL
effectively). So when I became a data engineer, and I spent most of my day
interacting with effectful systems, I attempted with some success to write a set
of <a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2018/11/07/data_driven_testing">data-driven integration tests using
<code>pytest</code></a> and leverage its ability to
parameterize over fixtures using data to create essentially a mongodump of test
descriptions. This solution was nice since it allowed me to scale the amount of
data I tested far beyond the amount of code I needed to write. However, I still
needed to come up with my own oracle values to test with. It's easy to run an
expensive integration test with very little added value.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in property-based testing stems from. I'd also mention
that even with property-based testing, all these testing strategies (and others
I haven't covered or discovered yet) have their place and their tradeoffs. You
should decide for yourself when to apply or to not apply each.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-property-based-testing">What is property-based testing?</h2>
<p>At its simplest, property-based testing is the inverse of normal unit testing.
Instead of providing some amount of data and a transformation so the computer
can assert a property, you provide a property and a transformation, so the
computer can provide some data.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the basics. Say you defined a method <code>addOne()</code> to increment an
integer by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>addOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test method <code>addOne()</code>, you can define a set of unit tests:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>():
    <span>assert</span> addOne(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>6</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can even parameterize a list of oracle inputs and expected values:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> pytest

<span>@pytest.mark.parametrize</span>(<span></span><span>'</span><span>_input, _expected</span><span>'</span>, [(<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>), (<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>), (<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>)])
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input, _expected):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _expected
</code></pre></div><p>The final leap is realizing that instead of coming up with your own oracle
values, you just care that the inputs are integers and the outputs are a
functional, deterministic transform resulting in an integer output. This is
where property-based testing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st

<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _input <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some properties, you can define and apply the opposite transform, which when
combined with the original transform, generates the identity function, which
should then leave the input untouched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>subOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

<span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st
<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addsub_returns_value</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> subOne(addOne(_input)) <span>==</span> _input
</code></pre></div><p>So what else is it similar to / different from? One's <em>generative testing</em>,
which are tests that create tests. Since we're creating a spec here,
<code>hypothesis</code> is generating tests underneath the hood for us and running them.
Otherwise, property-based testing is a bit different as it supports intelligent
search strategies that allow us to shrink the error space.</p>
<p>Another testing paradigm similar to property-based testing is <em>fuzz testing</em>,
where random inputs are inserted into a program to see how it behaves and
whether it crashes. To me, fuzz testing is more an extension of black-box
integration testing, and extends more into devops or security related testing,
rather than the unit-focused nature of property-based testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hypothesis">What is <code>hypothesis</code>?</h2>
<p><code>hypothesis</code> is one of the more popular implementations of property-based
testing in Python. I had thought it originated from a PBT library called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck"><strong><code>QuickCheck</code></strong></a> in Haskell,
but after reading through a Haskell book earlier this year and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ovebeq/pythonista_s_review_haskell#c_gz09vc">talking to some
folks online</a>,
there's a more “intelligent” PBT library in Haskell it came from called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog"><strong><code>Hedgehog</code></strong></a>, which applies
built-in shrinking as part of the test generation suite.</p>
<p>You can find the <code>hypothesis</code> for Python documentation
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>, and additional
documentation around the team behind Hypothesis
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-strategies"><code>hypothesis</code> strategies</h3>
<p>The key idea behind <code>hypothesis</code> is strategy generation. You can see examples of
it by running this code segment in your <code>python</code> terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> strategies <span>as</span> st

st<span>.</span>text()<span>.</span>example()
</code></pre></div><p><code>hypothesis</code> supports basic strategies like those targeting Python's “primitive”
types. You can create <code>st.integers()</code> or <code>st.text()</code>. You can also do more
advanced things, like create strategies from structs like dictionaries or lists,
combine strategies together, infer strategies from a regular expression, and
build strategies from well-recognized third-party classes from <code>pandas</code> or
Django.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-tactics"><code>hypothesis</code> tactics</h3>
<p>I took a lot of these tactics from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">a talk by Zac Hatfield-Dodds introducing PBT
at PyCon US</a>. Check out his website
<a href="https://zhd.dev/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The types of properties you can apply with <code>hypothesis</code> allow for certain
tactics you can play with in <code>hypothesis</code>.</p>
<p>One of these tactics might be manually defining the property, then letting
<code>hypothesis</code> generate the test cases for you. One common way this tactic is
applied is to look for “round-trip” properties, where you look for the inverse
method and check that applying both would result in the identity method.</p>
<p>Another tactic might be to use an oracle function. This can be really helpful if
you're refactoring a piece of code and you want to carry forward the original
behavior of that method, regardless of whether it's correct or incorrect. In
this case, that method becomes an oracle and you can apply the equal-by-value
constraint between the original and refactored methods as a …</p></div></div>

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7. Stop finishing Projects</strong></p><p><em>Biggest loss</em></p><p>I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is a question that often arises in the product world and it requires our time to unpack it. Though these roles are somewhat similar and they work towards achieving the same set of goals, we then ought to look at the clear line distinction in the line of duty of the individuals and performance metric used to evaluate the success achieved by each role to help us understand them better and also help you figure out the most suitable for you.</p><p>These roles vary from company to company as in the case of a startup, a product manager is often tasked with the duty of these 3 roles while in larger or enterprise companies, there are 3 or more different roles in the product team working at different capacities to ensure that the right product is shipped and meet the demands of users.</p><p>While the product manager’s role is one that has come to limelight, the product marketing manager and product owner role have also been adopted by a lot of companies depending on their product and company culture. In this article, we will explain the difference between these roles and the job requirement of the individual involved.</p><h3 id="the-product-manager">The Product Manager</h3><p>These individuals are often referred to as mini CEOs of a product. They conduct customer surveys to figure out the customer’s pain and build solutions to address it. The PM also prioritizes what features are to be built next and prepares and manages a cohesive and digital product roadmap and strategy.</p><h3 id="the-product-marketing-manager">The Product Marketing Manager</h3><p>The PMM communicates vital product value — the “why”, “what” and “when” of a product to intending buyers. He manages the go-to-market strategy/roadmap and also oversees the pricing model of the product. The primary goal of a PMM is to create demand for the products through effective messaging and marketing programs so that the product has a shorter sales cycle and higher revenue.</p><h3 id="the-product-owner">The Product Owner</h3><p>This role exists in a scrum environment — <em><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" title="Scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scrum</a> is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.</em></p><p>A product owner (PO) maximizes the value of a product through the creation and management of the product backlog, creation of user stories for the development team. The product owner is the customer’s representative to the development team. He addresses customer’s pain points by managing and prioritizing a visible product backlog. The PO is the first point of call when the development team needs clarity about interpreting a product feature to be implemented.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!
</p>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>

<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>

<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when  members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started  beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the  group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the  videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a>  as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million  members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in  order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This  quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall  Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target  where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a  rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop  stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by  the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion,  hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their  longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund,  Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a>  Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). An even bigger fund,  Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army  needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other  online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side  of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and  crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the  group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted  justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by  Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks  earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated  warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all  days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors  were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as  Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that  it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its  users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had  identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to  “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate  to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over  100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store,  Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal  trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their  24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions,  covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in  reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price  levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks  out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig  in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and  started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy  outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online  trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment,  and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of  censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a>  of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president  was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we  could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we  would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President  Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further  “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However,  much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these  speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power  has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a  genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat  passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected  insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose  Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against  WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was  being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything  that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as  these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you  visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably  reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a>  such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could  be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The  founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One  Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small  percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many  content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a>  the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social  networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the  dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics  of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down  on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that  ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to  recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts,  leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so  voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may  not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher  complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world  of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the  harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem  down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will  be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized,  centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech  companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship  is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon  that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they  exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to  WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this  issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left  and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when  she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial  crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former  treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her  with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she  recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can  say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them.  Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.  People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders  also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s  precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social  media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in  number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social  networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to  effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent  elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall  Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any  censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After  the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about  the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was  “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by  the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by  social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including  Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud  Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but  they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to  have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the  narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit  from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could  possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in  the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a  tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame  for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016.  Social …</p></div></div>

<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In my <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">previous post</a>, I remarked on the fact that composition, while central to our work as engineers, is often poorly supported by the tools we use. In this post I want to explore a specific trend away from this state of affairs, where composition is given the first-class treatment it deserves.</p><p>When engineering with atoms, composing components often consists of literally putting them together: you take piece A, move it close to piece B, and combine them by inserting tab X into slot Y. Sometimes an analogous case occurs in software: developers may instantiate instances of two particular design patterns in a class definition and compose them by ensuring the overlap meets both requirements, or copy in a template or project scaffold to compose a general structure with their specific use case.</p><p>Most of the time, however, software engineers compose by <em>reference</em>, making one part of the system conform to the interface of another and indirectly interact with the component exposing the interface through some pointer, handle, or name. These layers of indirection allow for more efficient reuse of components, clearer conceptual boundaries, and more specialized and dynamic composition. This benefits both the humans using the tools and the automated systems operating behind the scenes, at various time scales. Composition by named reference is so fundamental that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">one of the two foundational models of computation</a> revolves exclusively around referencing by name and resolving those references!</p><h2>Programming and networking</h2><p>Traditionally, most sophisticated name-based composition acted at the levels of building programs or of connecting entire machines.</p><p>Composition by name is ubiquitous in programming. We reference packages we want to use by a name and a version. We identify libraries we depend on by name. We call functions, consume data, implement interfaces, etc., all via their names. Then our tools take over: Our editors provide us documentation by name, our compilers look up type information and calling conventions by name, our static and dynamic linkers connect needed functionality across binary components by name.</p><p>Any user of post-Internet computers is intimately familiar with our industry's other venerable usage of names: finding another machine on the network. Every time you type a URL in your search bar, click a link, or configure an application to point to some specific service, you are composing computer resources by name. The most systematized and sophisticated aspect of these names is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a>, which gives you a high quality way to connect a top level name to a specific machine. Most of the rest of the URL is particular to each individual system, with at best weak conventions governing their use and meaning. But for both human and machine consumers, the domain name contains very precise semantics for composition at the machine level.</p><p>These names are not only crucial operationally, to put everything together in the system, they are also crucial cognitively, to put everything together in our minds. It's a clichéd joke that naming something is one of the two hardest problems in computer science, but that joke is based on the very serious fact that a name lets us treat a complex system as a single unit, and a good name helps us do that effectively.</p><p>DNS and programming language symbol resolution are at this point completely entrenched. They've been around in the relevant forms for the entire productive career of a huge portion of our industry. In more recent decades, however, some new approaches to name-based composition in new domains have emerged.</p><h2>Semantically-meaningful resource naming</h2><p>After the previous section, some of you may be wondering: What about the filesystem? It's true that files and other system resources have long been named by strings, with some weak structure for navigating trees of resources (i.e., the directory separator) and, on some systems, the type of file being named (the file extension). Similarly, other resources have long been referenced by name: <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a> names not the server at google.com, but the specific HTTPS service exposed by that server over TCP port 443.</p><p>The problem with these and other naming systems is that they put too much of the work of composition onto the users. With a few minor exceptions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">filesystem hierarchy standard</a> and file extensions, file paths tell you almost nothing about the file in question that you didn't already know. Almost no one looks at the full URL of a hyperlink and extracts meaningful information from it that wasn't present in the context of the link. This results in the status quo: these names are almost always treated as fully opaque identifiers, and very few common naming rules apply across teams and systems.</p><p>Some systems have taken steps to move beyond this situation, however. In this section I will briefly cover a few novel tools that in some cases have succeeded in and in others promise to provide <em>semantically meaningful</em> names to compose different computational resources.</p><h3>git</h3><p>I assume most of you are familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, at a high level. At a primitive level, git operates on various types of <em>objects</em>, such as blobs, commits, or symlinks. At the human interface level, many of these objects are ultimately referenced by ad hoc unstructured names, such as "file x/y/z on branch foo". That being said, you've probably seen commits referenced by a <em>hash</em>, such as 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb. Hashes like this are what the human-readable names are translated into, and how all of the objects internally refer to each other.</p><p>What do the hashes mean? Each object can be <em>serialized</em>, i.e. written to a file such that it can be correctly reconstructed later, including references to any other objects it depends on. These serializations are <em>canonical</em>, such that any two objects that are the same will have byte for byte the same serialization. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> on the contents of these serialized files then allows the git tools to give each object a short name that captures the full information content of the object, modulo unlikely hash collisions. We therefore call these <em>content-addressed</em> names.</p><p>Why should we use content-addressed names? In short, because they allow different components of the system to cheaply refer to each other with a high degree of reliability: If some commit object says that its associated filesystem tree has some file at a particular path, I know that whenever I refer to that file via relative references from the commit, I will get a file with exactly the same contents.</p><p>This allows for safe deduplication of files across commits and efficient communication protocols for distributing repositories across the network. It also gives a much more precise meaning to the names in question: "the file at x/y/z" can refer, at different times and on different systems, to any kind of file the relevant filesystem supports, whereas "the file at x/y/z in the tree of commit 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb" refers, for most intents and purposes, to exactly one file with specific contents.</p><h3>Nix</h3><p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-about-nix">Nix</a> is a package manager for Unix systems. It is built on several innovations, but the one relevant for this post is the Nix store, where the filesystem resources associated with packages are managed.</p><p>Like git, Nix manages some of its filesystem resources by content-addressed name, using essentially the same logic as git's hash-based content addressing. By themselves, however, such names are inadequate to Nix's goal of highly reliable and accurate dependency management with composition across packages. If I've built package foo 1.0 against some specific content-addressed instance of package bar 2.0, I can calculate the content and thus a content-addressed name of the resulting package. But if you want to build foo 1.0 against the newly released bar 2.1, you can't reuse anything in that content addressed name and must rebuild from scratch.</p><p>Nix addresses this issue with what I call <em>recipe-addressed</em> names: Some filesystem resources are named not by their own content but by the content of a serialization of <em>a deterministic build recipe</em> for creating it. The nature of these build recipes is such that it is much easier to substitute in different versions, configurations, etc. anywhere in the dependency tree and recalculate what the new name of the results should be.</p><p>With content-addressed names for bootstrapping, and recipe-addressed names for building up more complex packages, Nix opens up a whole new world of package management. Nix can ensure that many different machines, however different their configurations, have exactly the same package installed.</p><p>Nix can safely reuse common dependencies between packages, parallelize builds, and distribute builds across multiple machines. Large centralized binary caches are possible with a <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">decentralized trust mechanism</a> built on top. On top of these capabilities, <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html#nixos">entire system configurations</a> can be deterministically captured in a single name, allowing reproducible deployments and much more reliable migration of personal systems across computers.</p><h3>Nelson</h3><p><a href="https://getnelson.io/">Nelson</a> is a "cloud-native" service orchestration framework built to take advantage of modern distribution, resource management, and coordination mechanisms. Among other things, Nelson enables deploying an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>-style network topology while retaining efficient garbage collection of unneeded services. Nelson achieves this by requiring services to reference each other via name resolution mechanisms it populates from high level service configurations. Each service configuration specifies the other services it depends upon, providing both a service name, which has meaning to the user, and a <a href="https://semver.org/"><em>semantic version</em></a>, which contains information about cross-version compatibility. Nelson leverages the information in the dependency specification and keeps track of which services depend on which, allowing it to safely remove old instances of services that are not …</p></div></div></div></div>

Let's go over a simple problem to see how this can be useful.</p><p>For this problem, we are given an array <code>arr</code>, and a subarray size <code>k</code>, and we are asked to find the <em>average</em> of <em>all</em> subarrays in <code>arr</code> of size <code>k</code>. So given an array like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a subarray size <code>k = 2</code>, the correct answer would be <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code> because:</p><ul><li><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> has three subarrays of size 2, namely <code>[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]</code>.</li><li>The average of the first subarray is <code>1 + 2 / 2 = 1.5</code>, the average of the second is <code>2.5</code> (using the same formula), and the average of the third is <code>3.5</code>.</li><li>Putting this together we get the final result <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code>.</li></ul><p>Given these steps, it seems pretty clear that in designing an algorithm to solve this problem we would have to (1) iterate through every subarray then (2) find the average of each and append it to the result array.</p><p>A straightforward way to find every subarray of an array is to iterate through each index of the array and <em>construct</em> the subarray that begins at that index by iterating <code>k</code> more times. In this second iteration we can also sum up the numbers to compute the resulting average. Here's what that would look like:</p><p>Doing that for <em>every</em> index in the array, we get the final algorithm:</p><p>Notice the number on the top right of the animation. This number represents the total number of steps required to compute the result given the inputs <code>arr</code> and <code>k</code>. Try adding two more items and see how that number changes—it went up, by a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Is there a better way?</p><p>Looking back at the algorithm, notice that most of the time we're counting numbers that we've already included before. Let's look at the animation again, this time highlighting all the double counts in red:</p><p>When the algorithm finishes, only 2 elements <strong>were not double counted!</strong> It turns out that no matter what inputs, this implementation will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself).</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two subarrays, we see there's a lot of overlap:</p><p>What if, on each step, we only take into account the <em>differences</em> instead? In other words, is there a way to get the sum of the second subarray from the sum of the first? If so, we would be able to <em>derive</em> the sum of the second subarray rather than recounting every element again.</p><p>In the example above, we can get the sum of the <strong>second subarray by subtracting 1 and adding 5</strong> to the sum of the first.</p><p>This reduces the sum computation from <code>k</code> iterations to only one iteration! This is also where the sliding window namesake comes from—it's as if we have a window of 4 items that we <em>slide</em> to the next subarray.</p><p>Maybe adding a border around the items would make the window more clear:</p><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - an array of numbers <code>arr</code> and a size of subarray <code>k</code>.</p><ol><li>At the start, we <em>build</em> the window—iterate until our window contains <code>k</code> items—while keeping track of the sum.</li><li>Then, we <em>slide</em> the window one item over, updating the sum by subtracting the item no longer in the window and adding the item that was added to the window. By doing this we ensure that the sum stays in sync with the items that are in the window.</li><li>With this sum we can compute the average as before.</li></ol><p>And that's the find all averages problem using the sliding window pattern! Notice how this implementation only needs 7 steps to calculate the sum instead of 13 with the previous implementation. Now that doesn't seem to be too big of a difference, but look how blazing fast the optimal implementation is compared to our previous one:</p><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of k to equal to the size of the array—both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the naive algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>Of course we're not limited to only counting averages. The sliding window pattern can be generalized to any problem that involves computing <em>something</em> in the subarray. As long as the problem has some definition of a window size, the pattern essentially boils down to:</p><ol><li>Maintaining some <strong>state</strong> in that window, and</li><li>keeping that state in sync with the items in the window through <strong>constant-time operations</strong>.</li></ol><p>By "constant-time operations" I mean without using further iterations and only using the stuff that leaves/enters the window.</p><p>In the case of the averages problem, the state that we're maintaining is the <strong>sum of the items</strong>. We're keeping this sum in sync with the items in the window by subtracting the item that's leaving and adding the item that's entering.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Here's another problem that makes use of the same concept of maintaining state and synchronizing that state. The problem's pretty simple—given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any <em>permutation</em> of that pattern. For example, given the string <code>aaacb</code> and the pattern <code>abc</code>, the algorithm should return <code>true</code> because the substring <code>acb</code> is a permutation of <code>abc</code>.</p><p>This is not as obvious of a sliding window problem than the problem we just worked through, but if you think of a string as an array of characters and a substring as a subarray, then the similarities start to show.</p><p>I'm not going to walk through each logical step to get to the optimal solution (that would take a minute!), but here are the main ideas:</p><ol><li>A string can only be a permutation of another if it's the same length. <em>This gives us the size of the window = <code>pattern.length</code></em>.</li><li>A string is <strong>exactly</strong> a permutation of another if it contains the exact same number of letters. A way to keep track of this is through a map of character -&gt; count pairs. <em>This gives us the state that we have to maintain</em>.</li><li>We need a way to update <em>and compare</em> the map in constant time. <em>Through this we fulfill the second condition of synchronizing state through constant operations</em>.</li></ol><p>With those ideas, here's the final solution:</p><p>If you're interested in more details of the algorithm (particularly the constant-time updates and comparison), open the note below!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: RDSInstance
metadata:
  name: example-rds

    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.medium

<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

<p>If you understand the underlying concept of recursion but struggle to implement it like myself, or you don't even know what it is, then this post if for you.</p>
<p>Recursion is defined as solving a complex problem by breaking the problem into smaller versions of itself that can be solved. In programming, this is done by having a function call itself.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of recursion are these two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: this case defines the smallest instance of a problem. In certain recursive solutions, there can be multiple base cases but for the purpose of this post's explanation, my example will only incorporate one. When coding, the base case prevents an infinite loop of the function calling itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: this case manipulates the problem in order to approach the base case. In programming, this is the case in which the function calls itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the recursive case will breakdown the problem until it arrives at the base case, after which the the sub solutions build up to solve the original problem.</p>
<p>Do not worry if your understanding of recursion is hazy because the above definitions will make sense when implementing a recursive solution in Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The Call Stack</h2>
<p>In order to truly understand how recursion is implemented in Python, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the call stack. </p>
<p>The call stack uses the stack data structure to keep track of local variables and previous function calls. The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. This means that the last item to be placed in the stack will be the first to be removed. To help visualize, think of a stack of plates:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612217672194/K8ZCDamI8.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="brooke-lark-sG-PR0BNwb4-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>Whatever plate is placed last on the stack is the first one to be removed.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the stack has two simple operations: push and pop. Push adds an item onto the stack and pop removes an item from the stack, returning its value.</p>
<p>In python, the call stack consists of frames. The bottom most frame is the global or module frame. This consists of all the global variables. Every time a function is called a new frame is pushed onto the stack containing its local variables and function arguments. When a function call returns, the frame is popped off the stack and its value is passed to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<h2 id="a-famous-recursion-example-factorial">A Famous Recursion Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is defined as so:</p>
<p>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</p>
<p>If we were to define the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as a mathematical equation, it would be:</p>
<p><code>factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)</code></p>
<p>The right side of the equation will be the <em>recursive case</em> of our solution. Notice, how the recursive case takes the original problem,<code>factorial(n)</code>, and makes it a simpler problem of multiplying <code>n</code> by whatever <code>factorial(n-1)</code> is.</p>
<p>We can define a function <code>factorial</code> that takes a parameter <code>n</code>. However, if we only defined this function with the above equation, it would call itself infinitely leading to an error.</p>
<p>This is because we did not define a <em>base case</em>. The most basic factorial is the factorial of 1 which equals 1. So we can tell the program that once it reaches the factorial of 1, instead of calling <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>, to just <code>return 1</code>. After which, the Python call stack will handle multiplying out the numbers.</p>
<p>After defining both the recursive and base cases, we arrive at the Python program below:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> n * factorial(n<span>-1</span>)
</code></pre><h2 id="in-depth-recursive-function-implementation">In Depth Recursive Function Implementation</h2>
<p>Before calling the factorial function, the Python call stack would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222009642/RKv1SGozi.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 1 (3).png"></p>
<p>Then, we call the factorial function passing in an argument of 4. </p>
<pre><code><span>factorial</span>(<span>4</span>)
</code></pre><p>A frame for the factorial function would be pushed onto to the call stack, setting the argument <code>n</code> equal to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222128046/cNmno7-YI.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 2.png"></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will then process the function and since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, it will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. However before the function can return a value, it must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code>. This will cause another factorial frame to be pushed on the stack, with the argument <code>n</code> set to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222294743/zXgfi23TF.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 3.png"></p>
<p>Again, since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, the function will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. Likewise, the function must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code> before returning a value. </p>
<p>This pattern will continue until the factorial frame with the argument n equal to 1 is pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222730246/6jJduzt8q.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 5 (1).png"></p>
<p>When this occurs, the function reaches the base case, so it instead returns 1. As I mentioned early when explaining the call stack, when a function returns, it pops its frame off the stack, transferring its value to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222867866/Npx8dueYc.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 6.png"></p>
<p>Now since the value for <code>factorial(n-1)</code> has been evaluated, the factorial function can evaluate the product and return it to the previous frame, pushing the current frame off the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222963799/kJ7D_a-7I.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 7.png"></p>
<p>This pattern continues until we reach the original function call...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612223032269/rxZsqVaa8.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 8.png"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the factorial function with argument 4 returns a value of 24.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When writing a recursive solution in Python, think of the problem in terms of a base case and recursive case. Ask yourself: "How can I define a recursive case that will help me reduce the problem towards a base case?"</p>
<p>When trying to understand a recursive solution, I find it best to visualize the call stack in my head.  Every time a function is called an item is added onto the stack and any time you encounter the return keyword, it pops an item off the stack and returns its value to the previous function call.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>It’s very hard to get hired as an entry-level software developer today.</p><p>There are more than ten times as many senior web developer jobs for every junior web developer job on both VentureLoop.com (jobs at startups) and Indeed.com. Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.
