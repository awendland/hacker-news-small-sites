<b>Abstract.</b> 
In 2020, we celebrated the 
30-year anniversary of our papers on
planning &amp; reinforcement learning with artificial neural networks (NNs) </a><a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> <a href="#PLAN2">[PLAN2]</a>.
The <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf">technical report 
FKI-126-90</a>   introduced several concepts that are now widely used:
(1) planning with recurrent NNs (RNNs) as world models,
(2) high-dimensional reward signals (also as inputs for a neural controller),
(3) deterministic policy gradients for RNNs,
(4) artificial curiosity <a href="#AC90b">[AC90b]</a> and intrinsic motivation  through
NNs that are both <em>generative</em> and <em>adversarial</em>
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%205">GANs are a special case</a>
<a href="#AC20">[AC20]</a>).
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html">In the 2010s</a>, these concepts 
became popular as 
compute became cheaper. Our more recent extensions since 2015 <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4-6]</a> <a href="#OBJ2">[OBJ2-4]</a> address 
planning in abstract concept spaces and  <em>learning to think</em>. 
Agents with adaptive recurrent 
world models even suggest a simple explanation of  consciousness and self-awareness (dating back three decades <a href="#CON16">[CON16]</a>).
I drew the illustrations of <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> by hand—some of them are shown here.

<p><a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf"><img src="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/fki466.png" alt="Learning &amp; Planning with Recurrent World Models; Adversarial Generative Nets for Artificial Curiosity and related concepts (1990)"></a>
In February 1990, I published the <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90ocr.pdf">Technical Report FKI-126-90</a> <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> (revised in November)
which introduced several concepts that have become popular in the field of Machine Learning.

</p><p> The report described a system for <b>reinforcement learning (RL) and planning</b> based on a combination of two 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/rnn.html"><b>recurrent neural networks</b></a>  (RNNs) called the <b>controller</b> and the <b>world model</b> <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>. The controller tries to maximize cumulative expected reward in an initially unknown environment. The world model learns to predict the consequences of the controller's actions. The controller can use the world model to <b>plan ahead</b> for several time steps through what's now called a <b>rollout</b>, selecting action sequences that maximise predicted cumulative reward <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> <a href="#PLAN2">[PLAN2]</a>. 
This <b>integrated architecture for learning, planning, and reacting</b> was apparently published 
<a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> <a href="#PLAN2">[PLAN2]</a> 
before Rich Sutton's DYNA <a href="#DYNA90">[DYNA90]</a> <a href="#DYNA91">[DYNA91]</a>.
(<a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> also cites work on
system identification with feedforward 
NNs <a href="#WER87">[WER87-89]</a> <a href="#MUN87">[MUN87]</a> <a href="#NGU89">[NGU89]</a> <a href="#JOR90">[JOR90]</a> <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a>.)
The approach led to lots of follow-up publications, not only 
in 1990-91 <a href="#PLAN2">[PLAN2-3]</a> <a href="#PHD">[PHD]</a>, 
but also in recent years, e.g., <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4-6]</a>.

and our 1990 application of world models to the 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/neural-attention-1990-1993.html">learning of sequential attention</a>
<a href="#ATT">[ATT]</a> <a href="#ATT0">[ATT0-2]</a>.

<b>Another novelty of 1990 was the concept of
high-dimensional reward signals.</b>
Traditional RL has focused on <em>one-dimensional</em> reward signals.
Humans, however, have millions of informative sensors for different types of pain and pleasure etc. 
To my knowledge, reference <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> was the first paper on RL with 
<em>multi-dimensional, vector-valued</em> pain and reward signals coming in through
many different sensors,
where cumulative values are predicted for all those sensors,
not just for a single scalar overall reward. 
Compare what was later called a <em>general value function</em>
<a href="#GVF">[GVF]</a>. 
Unlike previous adaptive critics,  the one of 1990 <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>
was multi-dimensional and recurrent. 


</p><p>
Unlike in traditional RL,  
those reward signals were also used as informative <em>inputs</em> to the controller NN 
learning to execute actions that maximise cumulative reward.
This is also relevant for <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html">metalearning</a>.
Compare <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2013">Sec. 13</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a>
and <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html#Sec.%205">Sec. 5</a> of <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a> and
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html#secFAST">Sec. 3</a> &amp; <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html#secAC">Sec. 6</a>

</p><p> <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/learningrobots.html"><img src="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/robocup466x288+1.png" alt=""></a>
Are such techniques applicable in the real world? For example, 
can NNs successfully plan to steer <b>real robots</b>? Yes, they can.
For example, my former postdoc Alexander Gloye-Förster 
led FU Berlin's FU-Fighters team that became robocup world champion 2004 in the fastest league (robot speed up to 5m/s) <a href="#RES5">[RES5]</a>. 
Their robocup robots planned ahead with neural nets, in line with the ideas 
outlined in <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>. 



</p><p>In 2005, Alexander and his team 
also showed how such concepts can be used to build so-called 
<b>self-healing robots</b> <a href="#RES5">[RES5]</a> <a href="#RES7">[RES7]</a>.
They constructed the <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/resilientmachines.html">first resilient machines</a> using continuous self-modeling. Their robots could autonomously recover from certain types of unexpected damage, through adaptive self-models derived from actuation-sensation relationships, used to generate forward locomotion.



</p><p>
The 1990 FKI tech report <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> also described basics of 
<em>deterministic policy gradients</em> for RNNs. 
Its section <em>"Augmenting the Algorithm by Temporal Difference Methods"</em> 
combined the <em>Dynamic Programming</em>-based
 <em>Temporal Difference</em> method <a href="#TD">[TD]</a> for predicting cumulative (possibly multi-dimensional) rewards 
with a gradient-based predictive 
model of the world,
 to compute weight changes for the separate control network.
See also Sec. 2.4 of the 1991 follow-up paper <a href="#PLAN3">[PLAN3]</a>
(and compare <a href="#NAN1">[NAN1-5]</a>). 
Variants of this were used a
quarter century later by DeepMind 
<a href="#DPG">[DPG]</a>
<a href="#DDPG">[DDPG]</a>.

</p><p><a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/unsupervised-neural-nets-fight-minimax-game.html"><img src="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/pmfaust466x288.jpg" alt="Predictability Minimization: unsupervised minimax game where one neural network minimizes the objective function maximized by another"></a>
Finally, the 1990 paper also introduced 
<b><a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/interest.html">Artificial Curiosity</a> through Adversarial Generative NNs</b>.

As humans interact with the world, they learn to predict the consequences of their actions. They are also curious, designing experiments that lead to novel data from which they can learn more. 
To build curious <em>artificial</em> agents, the papers <a href="#AC90">[AC90, AC90b]</a> introduced
a new type of <em>active</em> unsupervised or self-supervised learning with <em>intrinsic motivation</em>. 
It is based on a 
minimax game where one neural net (NN) minimizes the objective function maximized 
by another NN <a href="#R2">[R2]</a>. 
Today, I refer to 
this duel between two unsupervised adversarial NNs as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04493">Adversarial Artificial Curiosity</a> <a href="#AC20">[AC20]</a>,
to distinguish it from our later types of  <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/interest.html">Artificial Curiosity</a> and intrinsic motivation since 1991
<a href="#AC91b">[AC91b-AC20]</a>
<a href="#PP">[PP-PP2]</a>.

 




</p><p>
How does Adversarial Artificial Curiosity work? 
The controller NN (probabilistically) generates outputs that may influence an environment. The world model NN predicts the environmental reactions to the controller's outputs. 
Using gradient descent, the world model minimizes its error, thus becoming a better predictor. But in a zero sum game, the controller tries to find outputs that maximize the error of the world model, whose loss is the gain of the controller.
Hence the controller is motivated to invent novel outputs or experiments that yield data that the world model still finds surprising, until the data becomes familiar and eventually boring. Compare more recent summaries and extensions of this 
now popular principle, e.g., <a href="#AC09">[AC09]</a>.


</p><p> 
That is, in 1990, we already had 
<em>self-supervised</em> neural nets that were both 
<em>generative</em> and <em>adversarial</em> 
(using much later terminology from 2014 <a href="#GAN1">[GAN1]</a> <a href="#R2">[R2]</a>),
generating experimental outputs yielding novel data, 
not only for stationary 
patterns but also for pattern sequences, and even for the general case of
RL. 
In fact, the popular  
<em>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) </em> 
<a href="#GAN0">[GAN0]</a>
<a href="#GAN1">[GAN1]</a>  
(2010-2014)
are an application  of Adversarial Curiosity <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> where  the 
environment simply returns 1 or 0 depending on whether the controller's current output is in a 
given set  <a href="#AC20">[AC20]</a> <a href="#R2">[R2]</a>.  
See also <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%205">Sec. 5</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> and
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/2010s-our-decade-of-deep-learning.html#Sec.%204">Sec. 4</a> of <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a> and
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-turing-award-bengio-hinton-lecun.html#XVII">Sec. XVII</a>  of <a href="#T20">[T20]</a>.
BTW, note that Adversarial Curiosity <a href="#AC90">[AC90, AC90b]</a> &amp; GANs <a href="#GAN0">[GAN0, GAN1]</a>
&amp; our Adversarial <em>Predictability
Minimization</em> (1991) <a href="#PM1">[PM1-2]</a>  are
very different from other 
early adversarial machine learning settings <a href="#S59">[S59]</a> <a href="#H90">[H90]</a>
 which 
neither involved unsupervised NNs  nor were about modeling data nor used gradient descent  <a href="#AC20">[AC20]</a>.





</p><p>
As I have frequently pointed out since 1990 <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>,
<b>the weights of an NN should be viewed as its program.</b>
Some argue that the goal of a deep NN is to learn useful <em>internal representations</em> of 
observed data—there is even an <em>International Conference on Learning Representations</em> called ICLR.
But actually
the NN is learning a <em>program</em>  (the weights or parameters of a mapping)  
that <em>computes</em> such representations in response to the input data. 
The outputs of typical  NNs are differentiable with respect to their programs. 
That is, a simple program generator  
can compute a direction in program space where one may find a better program <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>.
Much of my work since 1989 has exploited this fact. 
See also <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2018">Sec. 18</a> of <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a>.

<img src="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/rnnai754x466.png" alt="Learning to think "></a>

</p><p>
The original controller/model (C/M) planner of 1990  <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a> focused on naive <em>"millisecond by millisecond planning,"</em> trying to predict and plan every little detail of its possible futures. Even today, this is
still a standard approach in many RL applications, e.g., RL for board games such as Chess and Go.
My more recent work of 2015, however, has
focused on abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning  <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4-5]</a>. 
Guided by 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html">algorithmic information theory</a>, I described RNN-based AIs (RNNAIs) that can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike the system of 1990 <a href="#AC90">[AC90]</a>, the RNNAI <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4]</a> learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially <b>learning to think</b> <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4]</a>. 
Compare also our recent related work on learning (hierarchically) structured 
concept spaces based on abstract objects <a href="#OBJ2">[OBJ2-5]</a>.
The ideas of <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4-5]</a> can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They  also explain concepts such as <b>mirror neurons</b> <a href="#PLAN4">[PLAN4]</a>. 

</p><p><a href="https://worldmodels.github.io/"><img src="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/davidha466+2.png" alt="A world model extracts compressed spatio-temporal representations which are fed into compact and simple policies trained by evolution (David Ha)"></a>
In 
<a href="https://worldmodels.github.io/">recent work with David Ha</a> 
of Google (2018) <a href="#PLAN6">[PLAN6]</a>,
a world model extracts compressed spatio-temporal representations which are fed into compact and simple policies trained by evolution, achieving state of the art results in various environments.



</p><p>
Finally, what does all of this have to do with the seemingly elusive 
concepts of <b>consciousness</b> and <b>self-awareness</b>?  My
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">first deep learning machine</a>
of 1991
<a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a> emulates aspects of consciousness as follows.
It uses unsupervised learning and <em>predictive coding</em> <a href="#UN0">[UN0-UN3]</a>  <a href="#SNT">[SNT]</a> to compress observation sequences. 
A so-called <em>"conscious chunker RNN"</em>  attends to unexpected events …</p></span></div></center></div></div>

    <p>A design system for building faithful recreations of old UIs.</p>

    </p>

    <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
    <p>
      7.css is a CSS framework for building interface components that look like Windows 7.
      It is built on top of the GUI backbone of <a href="https://github.com/botoxparty/XP.css">XP.css</a>,
      which is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/jdan/98.css">98.css</a>.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      This framework relies on the usage of <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. To make a button, you'll need
      to use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. Input elements require labels. Icon buttons rely on
      <code>aria-label</code>. This page will guide you through that process, but accessibility is a primary
      goal of this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can override many of the styles of your elements while maintaining the appearance provided by
      this framework. Need more padding on your buttons? Go for it. Need to add some color to your input labels?
      Be our guest.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This framework does not contain any JavaScript</strong>, it merely styles your HTML with some CSS.
      This means 7.css is compatible with your frontend framework of choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fastest way to use 7.css is to import it from unpkg.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/7.css"&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      You can also install 7.css <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/7.css">from npm</a>.
    </p>
    <p><em>Installation</em></p>
    <pre>npm install 7.css</pre>

    <p><em>Usage</em></p>
    <pre>import "7.css/dist/7.css";</pre>

          that causes the application to perform some action when the user clicks it.

          
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          A standard button measures 75px wide and 23px tall with 12px of horizontal padding by default.
          They are styled with 2 shades of gray as a vertical gradient.

      </details>
    </div>

          <p>
            When buttons are clicked, the gray gradient is shifted to corresponding sky blues.
            The following button is simulated to be in the pressed (active) state.

      </details>
    </div>

              <p>
                Disabled buttons maintain the same style, but have a "washed out"
                appearance in their label.
              </p>

      </details>
    </div>

                <p>
                  Button focus is communicated with a dotted border, set 4px within the contents of the button.
                  The following example is simulated to be focused.

      <h3 id="checkbox">CheckBox</h3>
      <div>
        <blockquote>
          A <em>check box</em> represents an independent or non-exclusive choice.
          
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Checkboxes are represented with a sunken panel, populated with a "check" icon when
          selected, next to a label indicating the choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: You <strong>must</strong> include a corresponding label <strong>after</strong>
          your checkbox, using the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element with a <code>for</code> attribute
          pointed at the <code>id</code> of your input. This ensures the checkbox is easy to use with
          assistive technologies, on top of ensuring a good user experience for all (navigating with the tab key,
          being able to click the entire label to select the box).

          <p>
            Checkboxes can be selected and disabled with the standard <code>checked</code> and <code>disabled</code>
            attributes.
          </p>

          <p>
            When grouping inputs, wrap each input in a container with the <code>field-row</code> class. This ensures
            a consistent spacing between inputs.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">sparse matrix</a> is a matrix that has a value of 0 for most elements.
If the ratio of <b>N</b>umber of <b>N</b>on-<b>Z</b>ero (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.spmatrix.getnnz.html">NNZ</a>) elements to the size is less than 0.5, the matrix is sparse.
While this is the mathematical definition, I will be using the term sparse for matrices with only NNZ elements and dense for matrices with all elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://matteding.github.io/images/sparse_dense.gif" alt="Sparse vs Dense"></p>

<p>Storing information about all the 0 elements is inefficient, so we will assume unspecified elements to be 0.
Using this scheme, sparse matrices can perform faster operations and use less memory than its corresponding dense matrix representation, which is especially important when working with large data sets in data science.</p>

<p>Today we will investigate all of the different implementations provided by the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html">SciPy sparse package</a>.
This implementation is modeled after <code>np.matrix</code> opposed to <code>np.ndarray</code>, thus is restricted to 2-D arrays and having quirks like <code>A * B</code> doing matrix multiplication instead of element-wise multiplication.</p>

<h2 id="construction-matrices">Construction Matrices</h2>
<p>Different sparse formats have their strengths and weaknesses.
A good starting point is looking at formats that are efficient for constructing these matrices.
Typically you would start with one of these forms and then convert to another when ready to do calculations.</p>

<h3 id="coordinate-matrix">Coordinate Matrix</h3>
<p>Perhaps the simplest sparse format to understand is the <b>COO</b>rdinate (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.coo_matrix.html">COO</a>) format.
This variant uses three subarrays to store the element values and their coordinate positions.</p>

<p>The savings on memory consumption is quite substantial as the matrix size increases.
Managing data in a sparse structure is a fixed cost unlike the case for dense matrices.
The overhead incurred from needing to manage the subarrays is becomes negligible as data grows making it a great choice for some datasets.</p>

<p>A word of caution: only use sparse arrays if they are sufficiently sparse enough; it would be counterproductive storing a mostly nonzero array using several subarrays to keep track of position and data.</p>

<h3 id="linked-list-matrix">Linked List Matrix</h3>

<p>The most flexible format to insert data is through usage of <b>LI</b>nked <b>L</b>ist (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.lil_matrix.html">LIL</a>) matrices.
Data can be set via <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.indexing.html">indexing and slicing</a> syntax of NumPy to quickly populate the matrix.
In my opinion, LIL is the coolest sparse format for constructing sparse matrices from scratch.</p>

<p><img src="https://matteding.github.io/images/lil.gif" alt="LIL Matrix"></p>

<p>LIL stores information in <code>lil.rows</code> where each list represents a row index and the elements inside the list match columns.
In a parallel array, <code>lil.data</code>, the NNZ values are stored.
But unlike other sparse formats, these subarrays <em>cannot</em> be explicitly passed to the constructor; LIL matrices must be made from either an empty state or from existing matrices, dense or sparse.
Below is an illustration of various techniques used to build up a LIL matrix.</p>

<p>So what’s the drawback…? Well, it utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array">jagged arrays</a> under the hood which requires <code>np.dtype(object)</code>.
This costs a lot more memory than a rectangular array, so if the data is big enough, you may be forced to work with COO instead of LIL.
In short, LIL is mostly offered as a convenience, albeit an awesome one at that.</p>

<p>As an aside, Linked List Matrix is a misnomer since it does <em>not</em> use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked lists</a> behind the scenes!
LIL actually uses Python’s <code>list</code> which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">dynamic array</a>, so it should really be called a List of Lists Matrix, in spite of what the documentation says.
(A missed opportunity to christen it as LOL…)</p>

<p>Adjacent pairs of index pointers determine two things.
First, their position in the pointer array is the row number.
Second, these values represent the [start:stop] slice of the indices array, and their difference is the NNZ elements in each row.
Using the pointers, look up the indices to determine the column for each element in the data.</p>

<p>CSC works exactly the same as CSR but has column based index pointers and row indices instead.
Below is a diagram of the same data in this format.
Notice for this particular case, CSC is slightly more compact with two fewer index pointers.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Learn what you want to learn, while you want to learn it.
Exploit your interest while it lasts.</p>
<h4 id="i-want-to-learn-rust-but-should-i-learn-c-first">I want to

<hr>
<h2 id="being-interested-is-a-rare-gift">Being Interested is a Rare
Gift</h2>
<p>Being <strong>interested</strong> is a rare gift. It enhances
every physical and mental trait while studying that thing you are
interested in. It makes you happy. It makes you have fun while
doing <em>work</em>! That is a rare gift.</p>
<p>An old co-worker and friend taught me this. He was once
interested in machine-learning. He studied it for awhile, he
learned a lot about it, then he was done. He explained to me that
he was able to be many times more productive with his study time by
studying those things that he was interested in, while he was
interested.</p>
<p>Why do we ask these questions? Why don’t we just get to work?
Because we’re scared. We think we are not ready, and we’re right,
we are not ready. We haven’t fulfilled the prerequisites.</p>
<p>While thinking about this post a phrase from <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/books/the-war-of-art/">The War of
Art</a> kept coming to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up
pain-free. He has to play hurt.”</p>
<p>– Steven Pressfield</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve managed to find a genuine interest in something new
and worth while, then today is your game day. You’re not ready?
Then you’ll have to play hurt. Your interest will not last forever.
The extra productivity and joy you can only gain through genuine
interest must be exploited now. Time is running out. If you wait
too long you wont get to play. You’ve seen this before; you’ve had
goals you were excited about, but you waited, and the excitement
left you.</p>
<h2 id="no-really-i-am-not-ready">No Really, I Am Not Ready!</h2>
<p>Maybe you really are not ready. You simply lack the
prerequisites for success. – Wait, who said anything about success?
– Do not try to <em>succeed</em>, try to <em>exploit your
interest</em>. You will succeed as a side effect, although your
success probably wont look like what you have imagined success to
look like. You will learn, you will be engaged and efficient, that
is success. Perhaps your interest will only last an hour before you
become overwhelmed and frustrated? So be it, that is an hour well
spent, and you will be better off for it.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, your interest will fade, and then you have my
permission to do something else. At the very least you will have
learned why some things are hard. Maybe you’ll get stuck on some
piece math or something and save yourself from becoming another
student who asks “why would I ever need this?” You’ll know why.</p>
<p>Speaking of math. In the real world tricks are good and there is
no cheating. Just solve the problem. Use a calculator or a computer
algebra system. Let the computer do your derivatives for you. It
wont matter in the real world. – Well, it might matter eventually.
Having a deeper understanding cannot be a bad thing, but you don’t
need it right now. Make a mental note of those things you’d like to
learn more deeply, and maybe you’ll find an interest in them one
day.</p>
<p>The same goes for other areas of study. The internet is big,
people can help you. You can copy and paste, don’t feel bad about
it. It’s OK if your program <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/">
only works on your computer</a>. It’s OK if your first drawings are
on scratch paper. Just don’t let your interest go to waste.</p>

			<p>Many people—including ones who comment at this website—have difficulty believing that we have been manipulated for centuries, and that both society and ourselves are the end result of those manipulations. I have said that this resistance is itself the result of those manipulations and, in a complementary fashion, of a privileged and sheltered life in which we never had to see, or be on the receiving end of, the raw power of these forces when they assume a less soft form of totalitarian control.</p>
<p>I think we are largely clueless how absurdly easy to manipulate we are. And while I can agree that “conspiratainment” is part of the problem and not the solution, the evidence it incorporates into its controlled counter-narrative is nonetheless compelling and finally irrefutable (which is perhaps why it mostly gets refuted with vague blanket statements, spiritual platitudes, or Marxist arguments about systemic problems).</p>
<p>I recently watched a Mexican TV show called <em>An Unknown Enemy</em>&nbsp;that shows how the CIA and the DFS (Mexican secret police) brought about a <em>coup</em> that was partially dependent on coopting the student protests and the international Olympics to oust one president and get their own man in place. It’s very well-done and seems historically responsible (I haven’t read up on it). Bear in mind that this was forty years ago, in an under-developed country, and yet the level of malevolence combined with ruthless efficiency—and <em>success</em>—is chilling.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/unknownenemy.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="608" srcset="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/unknownenemy.jpg 1080w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/unknownenemy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/unknownenemy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/unknownenemy-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></p>
<p>What occurred to me while watching it was that most “privileged” folk look at these dark slices of history and they think they are evidence of how undemocratic certain countries are, or were, how brutal and unjust the government systems, and how much better our own are. My own perspective is that this is only because our own societies have been so effectively managed, shaped, and controlled that these coarser methods are no longer required. We have the luxury of <em>believing</em> we are free, which is akin to the comfortable stupor of livestock ignorant that they are raised in an abattoir.</p>
<p>It is possible that, since I was raised to be an abattoir manager, I was never deceived.</p>
<p>There is another end of the social scale on which a person is less likely to believe in the benevolence of our “democratic” societies, and knows all too well how subject to manipulation we are. Someone who grew up in Serbia, for example, after generations of being on the blunt end of that instrument, has less difficulty with the idea that the empire has terraformed the landscape of the human organism, both inner and outer, since time began. They don’t need “conspiratainment” to make them paranoid-aware; they have first-hand encounter with the forces that shape history.</p>
<p>With this in mind I asked Cedomir to share some of his experiences. (In bold below and throughout the remainder of this piece.)</p>

<h2><strong>Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) &amp; Hollywood</strong></h2>
<p><strong>To give a satisfactory explanation of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and Hollywood’s role in it requires an understanding of its creation. To do that, I’ll have to oversimplify.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yugoslavia was created after the Treaty of Versailles in 1918. Its creation had some support from the local population, including bizarre bedfellows such as the Serbian Masonic Lodge and the Yugoslav Communist Party. The support was mainly to be found among the intelligentsia (groomed by the Illyrian movement) and some patriots who recognized that a unitary state of kindred peoples was preferable to small nation-states which had little to no chance of actual independence. Of the Great Powers, France and the US were principal supporters in the establishment of Yugoslavia. Great Britain, as always, wanted to ensure a balance of power, which is to say that no one got too big for their boots. The US even sent two battleships to Rijeka (in modern-day Croatia) to dissuade the Italian army from trying to claim the northern Adriatic. France’s “support” was so significant that the Nazis considered Yugoslavia to be a French satellite state.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The above is just the tip of the surface of the water settling over an iceberg.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There’s no racial hatred in the Balkans, we’re all the same race. The language spoken is categorized by linguists as “polycentric.” The fact is that the languages spoken in Italy or Germany have greater diversity than seven separate Balkan countries, but they’ve resolved it by creating unitary states at the right historical moment and imposing a “common language.” We’re essentially one people divided by religious identity and dialects masquerading as separate languages. SFR Yugoslavia was a centralized one-party state. Officially atheist and materialist, it didn’t suppress religious feelings but it did treat believers as backwards and retrograde. If one wasn’t a member of the League of Yugoslav Socialists, the ladder one could climb was relatively short. When the war kicked off and blood was spilt, people (as people do) converged instinctively behind their local (religious) banners looking for safety. It proved to be a disaster for many as it was “their own” who betrayed them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was born in the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, lived in London for 20 years between the age of and 11 and 31 and then moved to rump Serbia eleven years ago (The Autonomous Province of Kosovo is, according to the UN Security Council Resolution 1244, under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and a NATO-led peacekeeping force). While growing up in the UK, I used to go home regularly throughout the war years. Because of the events in Yugoslavia, it became clear to me that the real story is very different than the news reports. I’d watch BBC and Channel 4 one day and then watch RTS (Serbian PBS) a day later. Brainwashing and mind programming, overt and covert. </strong></p>

<h2>Malevolent Design</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/digitalplanet.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/digitalplanet.jpg 512w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/digitalplanet-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></p>
<p>While (as my readers and listeners ought to know by now), I fully allow that the conspiring of human elites is a symptom of something much deeper, I also inquire into whether that deeper something might also be by design. We know about intelligent design, because the evidence of it is everywhere. What about malevolent design? Are intelligence and malevolence mutually exclusive—or is there a form in intelligence that <em>in its very nature</em> is anti-natural?</p>
<p>Part of my strategy with <em>16 Maps of Hell</em> and previous books is to surround the reader’s attention and create a sustained exposure to unpalatable evidence of how we have been unfavorably shaped by malevolent design. My hope is that the evidence will neutralize a <em>continuous internal broadcast</em> (a propagandized and traumatized nervous system) designed to maintain the crucial fiction that “this couldn’t possibly be happening, not here, now, not to me and my loved ones!”</p>
<p>Of course, this approach is limited and can backfire. Can one fight fire with fire? Can one use words to dissolve the spell that words have cast over our consciousness? Information is always finite, and when it’s especially unappealing it will be met with counter-narratives that reframe the evidence in a way that is less conclusive or disturbing, and easier to dismiss and forget. I suspect university training has a lot to do with it; less well-educated people, or self-educated ones, tend to be more open to my work.</p>
<p>But there’s also a lack of critical discernment (as compared to an over-developed intellect) that is just as crippling—witness David Icke and Alex Jones, hardly anyone’s idea of a nuanced or complex reading of social reality.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who don’t learn from history, become the unwitting instruments of it—either its agents or its sacrifices, or both.</p>

<h2>Sending Bosnia Back to the Bronze Age</h2>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/croatia-after-war.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="398" srcset="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/croatia-after-war.jpg 512w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/croatia-after-war-300x233.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Southeast Europe (the Balkans is a bit loaded and of dubious origin) has been a battleground since the Bronze Age. It’s an interesting case study for world events.</strong></p>
<p><strong>During the war in Bosnia, from 1992 to 1995, Serbs were presented in the Western media as medieval central Asian marauders from illustrated history books. While the rape of civilian women did occur, and the perpetrators can be found on all three warring sides, the stories took on fantastic dimensions. The Serb army in Bosnia, made up of locals, was made to seem like barbarians storming the gates of western civilization. The accusations of rape became so ridiculous that one could reasonably assume that they had no military strategy or goal in sight other than to rape Bosnian Muslim women. The figures were exaggerated so as to present the Serbs as alien and menacing, if not pure evil. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Joe Biden made some memorable anti-Serb remarks, my favorite being that “Serbs were genetically predisposed to genocide.” Flash-forward four years when the most powerful military alliance in history (NATO) bombed Serbia against international law. This time, Serb soldiers were raping countless Kosovo Albanian women. Again, the numbers were ridiculous, and the implication was that the desire for rape was the primary drive of the Serb army. What made this particular piece of propaganda especially disgusting was that the NATO air force was dropping depleted uranium on the population it claimed to be saving. More bombs were dropped on Kosovo per square kilometer than on any other part of Serbia, and the last remnant of a system striving to be self-sufficient was destroyed. </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2011/06/08/libya-gaddafi-used-r.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/viagra-rape.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="603" srcset="https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/viagra-rape.jpg 696w, https://media.auticulture.com/wp-content/uploads/viagra-rape-300x260.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></a></p>
<p><strong>Fast forward again, this time to 2011 and Libya: the media claimed that Gadhafi’s army was raping women in rebel areas from its very first reports. No superficial bullshit introduction to the conflict. It was immediate. However, this time the journalists came up with an even more bizarre story: Gadhafi’s army was using Viagra! For some reason, people think that wholesale rape of women is something that a retreating army, poorly equipped and fighting an immeasurably more powerful adversary, is especially interested in raping the women. The anchor just accepted that account as fact and moved on to further vilify Muammar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The narrative …</strong></p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>oh boy oh boy........I have been using the AirPods Max for hours daily for the last 7 days.</p><h5 id="airpods-max-s-largest-competitor-is-the-apple-airpods">AirPods Max’s largest competitor is the Apple AirPods</h5><h2 id="context">Context</h2><p>Firstly, these are my thoughts based on my use case. I am not an audiophile (although most reviewers are saying this lol) and I certainly do not have the ears to identify the nuance in sound. For example, both the AirPods 2 and AirPods Pro almost sound the same to my ears. I must say, I find the AirPods 2 more comfortable than my AirPods Pro because the AirPods seat in the ear as opposed to the AirPods Pro are inside the ear.</p><h2 id="experience">Experience</h2><p>The only reason, I purchased the AirPods Max is because, before these headphones, I had yet to find a pair where my ears do not get hot within 30 minutes of use. I was hoping, these would be the same and as such, I do not have to consider whether I would pay $550 for these. Well, both fortunately and unfortunately, <strong>my ears did not get hot even after hours of use</strong>. This was a Christmas miracle. Finally, headphones exist that are made for my ears. Prior to these, I had tested all the Bose and Beats noise-cancelling headphones without success. The Sony headphones do not come with a customer friendly returns policy, so I haven't tested them. I think, AirPods Max are different <strong>because unlike all the other headphones, the cups are NOT made of leather.</strong></p><p>For me, comfort is most important and as my wallet takes a sigh of relief, my AirPods are still the most comfortable means of personal music/podcast listening. Even though, the AirPods Max is the most comfortable headphones I have tried, they are distant second to my AirPods in terms of comfort and the sound quality on the AirPods is acceptable to me.</p><p>AirPods Max are the best in class:</p><ul><li>Noise Cancellation</li><li>Music listening</li><li>Transparency</li><li>Design and build quality</li><li>Only headphones I know that stand on their own two cups. Now that's cool.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/Image-28-12-20--7-50-am-1.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>The following are where the AirPods Max fall short:</p><ul><li>comfort is not as good as AirPods</li><li>Noise cancellation is so good that I struggle to hear my wife calling within my home. I find the noise cancelling is so good that I am lost in silence and am completely unaware of things happening in the house. My home is already quiet so there is no need for noise cancelling. Turning it off was the only option and that works well enough.</li><li>Pronounced pressurization effect</li><li>Portability </li><li>Lighting charging (and no wireless charging)</li><li>The joke of a case. My AirPods case charges my AirPods as well.</li><li>Because of the cost and the canopy headband, I cannot help but baby this thing all the time - it's like a big baby</li></ul><h5 id="i-am-so-accustomed-to-the-convenience-the-airpods-provide-that-the-airpods-max-seem-cumbersome-for-my-use-case-">I am so accustomed to the convenience the AirPods provide that the AirPods Max seem cumbersome for my use case.</h5><p><strong>Spatial audio</strong> : this is a pointless feature. There is no way I am watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a> on my iPhone or iPad to use this feature. Bring it on the Apple TV than I will reconsider.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality</strong>: regardless of the hype, these are Bluetooth headphones and as such the same Bluetooth limitations are applicable here. Nonetheless, these are the best sounding Bluetooth headphones I have heard. The credit for this goes to the two H1 chips and Apple’s sound processing. Your ears may hear things that I do not, so my view is just as subjective as any other reviewer’s view on this.</p><p>To summarise, all this year, I worked from home and I do not see this changing in 2021. Therefore, I do not need noise cancelling and frankly prefer my AirPods because they are more comfortable. Would I prefer these for when I sit down for quality music listening - You bet I would. Well, in practice, when this is the case, I usually listen to music on my 5.1 Sonos surround sound with my wife and family.</p><h5 id="i-do-not-have-space-for-the-airpods-max-in-my-life-and-as-such-these-are-going-back-airpods-were-life-changing-for-me-these-are-not-">I do not have space for the AirPods Max in my life and as such, these are going back. &nbsp;AirPods were life changing for me, these are not.</h5><h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>If I were using it all day like my AirPods, I would have kept them but it would still bug me that they are priced almost 50% above their closest competition and more than 100% above the AirPods Pro. Regardless of what anyone says, I refuse to believe that these are 50% better than the Bose. But that's the Apple premium tax. However, I sense these are priced like the HomePods and will also be significantly discounted in the coming 12 to 18 months.</p><p>I understand folks supporting Apple and providing an argument as to why shouldn't Apple charge a premium if they're providing a premium product. And I agree, Why shouldn't they? Apple can charge whatever they want, but if I find that it's not premium enough for me, than it's ultimately my decision to make. Furthermore, Apple at times has incorrectly priced their products. HomePod is a perfect example, as evident by the significant discounts regularly available on the HomePod. These significant discounts of RRP is not seen in other Apple products.</p><h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation</h2><p><strong>Sound is subjective and listening to sound is also subjective</strong>. Therefore, what sounds amazing to you, may sound <em>meh</em> to me. I suggest taking advantage of Apple's excellent returns policy and<strong> give it a try to DECIDE for YOURSELF</strong>. Then, when these are on sale, you can grab them from any retailer if these fit your use case.</p><p>I am human after all and very sensitive to a good bargain so this may end up as an impulse buy in the future. Very unlikely but stranger things have occurred.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/osnr/TabFS">TabFS</a> is a browser extension that
mounts your browser tabs as a filesystem on your computer.</p>

<p>Out of the box, it supports Chrome and (to a lesser extent<sup id="fnref:firefox"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:firefox">1</a></sup>)
Firefox, on macOS and Linux.<sup id="fnref:otherbrowsers"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:otherbrowsers">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Each of your open tabs is mapped to a folder.</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://omar.website/tabfs/doc/00-browser.png">
<img src="https://omar.website/tabfs/doc/00-finder.png"></p><p>I have 3 tabs open, and
they map to 3 folders in TabFS</p>
</div>

<p>The files inside a tab's folder directly reflect (and can control) the
state of that tab in your browser. (TODO: update as I add more)</p>

<div>

</video>
<p>Example: the url.txt, text.txt, and title.txt
files inside a tab's folder, which tell me those live properties
for that tab</p>
</div>

<p>This gives you a <em>ton</em> of power, because now you can apply <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1018570020324962305">all the
existing tools</a>
on your computer that already know how to deal with files -- terminal
commands, scripting languages, etc -- and use them to control and
communicate with your browser.</p>

<p>Now you don't need to <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1261392522485526528">code up a browser extension from
scratch</a> every
time you want to do anything. You can write a script that talks to
your browser in, like, a melange of Python and bash, and you can save
it as <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1308588645872435202">a single ordinary
file</a> that you
can run whenever, and it's no different from scripting any other part
of your computer.</p>

<h3 id="close-all-stack-overflow-tabs">Close all Stack Overflow tabs</h3>

<pre><code>$ rm mnt/tabs/by-title/*Stack_Overflow*

<p>or (older / more explicit)</p>

<pre><code>$ echo remove | tee -a mnt/tabs/by-title/*Stack_Overflow*/control
</code></pre>

<h4 id="btw">btw</h4>

<p>(this task, removing all tabs whose titles contain some string, is a
little contrived, but it's not that unrealistic, right?)</p>

<p>(now... how would you do this <em>without</em> TabFS?  I honestly have no
idea, off the top of my head. like, how do you even get the titles of
tabs? how do you tell the browser to close them?)</p>

<p>(I looked up the APIs, and, OK, if you're already in a browser
extension, in a 'background script' inside the extension, <em>and</em> your
extension has the <code>tabs</code> permission -- this already requires you to
make 2 separate files and hop between your browser and your text
editor to set it all up! -- you can do
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabs/#method-query">this</a>:
<code>chrome.tabs.query({}, tabs =&gt; chrome.tabs.remove(tabs.filter(tab =&gt;
tab.title.includes('Stack Overflow')).map(tab =&gt; tab.id)))</code>)</p>

<p>(not <em>terrible</em>, but look at all that upfront overhead to get it set
up. and it's not all that discoverable. and what if you want to reuse
this later, or plug it into some larger pipeline of tools on your
computer, or give it a visual interface? the jump in complexity once
you need to communicate with anything -- possibly setting up a
WebSocket, setting up handlers and a state machine -- is pretty
horrifying)</p>

<p>(but to be honest, I wouldn't even have conceived of this as a thing I
could do in the first place)</p>

<h3 id="save-text-of-all-tabs-to-a-file">Save text of all tabs to a file</h3>

<pre><code>$ cat mnt/tabs/by-id/*/text.txt &gt; text-of-all-tabs.txt
</code></pre>

<h3 id="run-script">Run script</h3>

<pre><code>$ echo 'document.body.style.background = "green"' &gt; mnt/tabs/last-focused/execute-script
$ echo 'alert("hi!")' &gt; mnt/tabs/last-focused/execute-script
</code></pre>

<h3 id="reload-an-extension-when-you-edit-its-source-code">Reload an extension when you edit its source code</h3>

<p>Suppose you're working on a Chrome extension (apart from this
one). It's a pain to reload the extension (and possibly affected Web
pages) every time you change its code. There's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2963260/how-do-i-auto-reload-a-chrome-extension-im-developing">Stack Overflow
post</a>
with ways to automate this, but they're all sort of hacky. You need
yet another extension, or you need to tack weird permissions onto your
work-in-progress extension, and you don't just get a command you can
trigger from your editor or shell to refresh the extension.</p>

<p>TabFS lets you do all this in <a href="https://github.com/osnr/playgroundize-devtools-protocol/blob/main/go.sh">an ordinary shell
script</a>.
You don't have to write any browser-side code at all.</p>

<p>This script turns an extension (this one's title is "Playgroundize
DevTools Protocol") off, then turns it back on, then reloads any tabs
that have the relevant pages open (in this case, I decided it's tabs
whose titles start with "Chrome Dev"):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -eux
echo false &gt; mnt/extensions/Playg*/enabled
echo true &gt; mnt/extensions/Playg*/enabled
echo reload | tee mnt/tabs/by-title/Chrome_Dev*/control
</code></pre>

<p>I mapped this script to Ctrl-. in my text editor, and now I just hit
that every time I want to reload my extension code.</p>

<h3 id="todo-live-edit-a-running-web-page">TODO: Live edit a running Web page</h3>

<p>edit <code>page.html</code> in the tab folder. I guess it could just stomp
outerHTML at first, eventually could do something more sophisticated</p>

<p>(it would be cool to have a persistent storage story here
also. I like the idea of being able to put arbitrary files anywhere in
the subtree, actually, because then you could use git and emacs
autosave and stuff for free... hmm)</p>

<h3 id="todo-watch-expressions">TODO: Watch expressions</h3>

<pre><code>$ touch mnt/tabs/last-focused/watches/window.scrollY
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can <code>cat window.scrollY</code> and see where you are scrolled on the
page at any time.</p>

<p>Could make an <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1080878682275803137">ad-hoc
dashboard</a>
around a Web page: a bunch of terminal windows floating around your
screen, each sitting in a loop and using <code>cat</code> to monitor a different
variable.</p>

<h3 id="todo-import-data-json-xls-js">TODO: Import data (JSON? XLS? JS?)</h3>

<p>drag a JSON file <code>foo.json</code> into the <code>imports</code> subfolder of the tab
and it shows up as the object <code>imports.foo</code> in JS. (modify
<code>imports.foo</code> in JS and then read <code>imports/foo.json</code> and you read the
changes back?)</p>

<p>import a plotting library or whatever the same way? dragging
<code>plotlib.js</code> into <code>imports/plotlib.js</code> and then calling
<code>imports.plotlib()</code> to invoke that JS file</p>

<p>the browser has a lot of potential power as an interactive programming
environment, one where graphics come <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1295828978477932544">as
naturally</a> as
console I/O do in most programming languages. i think something that
holds it back that is underexplored is lack of ability to just... drag
files in and manage them with decent tools. many Web-based 'IDEs' have
to reinvent file management, etc from scratch, and it's like a
separate universe from the rest of your computer, and migrating
between one and the other is a real pain (if you want to use some
Python library to munge some data and then have a Web-based
visualization of it, for instance, or if you want to version files
inside it, or make snapshots so you <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1288725175895068673">feel
comfortable</a>
trying stuff, etc).</p>

<p>(what would the persistent storage story here be? localStorage? it's
interesting because I almost want each tab to be <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1344753559007420416">less of a
commodity</a>,
less
<a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1270192308772691968">disposable</a>,
since now it's the site I'm dragging stuff to and it might have some
persistent state attached. like, if I'm programming and editing stuff
and saving inside a tab's folder, that tab suddenly really
<a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1251863115022491653">matters</a>; I
want it to survive as long as a normal file would, unlike most browser
tabs today)</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p><strong>disclaimer</strong>: this extension is an experiment. I think it's cool and
useful and provocative, and I usually leave it on, but I make no
promises about functionality or, especially, security. applications
may freeze, your browser may freeze, there may be ways for Web pages
to use the extension to escape and hurt your computer ... In some
sense, the <a href="https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1338932056743546880">whole
point</a> of this
extension is to create a gigantic new surface area of communication
between stuff inside your browser and software on the rest of your
computer.</p>

<p>Before doing anything, clone <a href="https://github.com/osnr/TabFS">this repository</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/osnr/TabFS.git
</code></pre>

<p>First, install the browser extension.</p>

<p>Then, install the C filesystem.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-browser-extension">1. Install the browser extension</h3>

<p>(I think for Opera or whatever other Chromium-based browser, you could
get it to work, but you'd need to change the native messaging path in
install.sh. Not sure about Safari. maybe Edge too? if you also got
everything to compile for Windows)</p>

<h4 id="in-chrome">in Chrome</h4>

<p>Go to the <a href="chrome://extensions">Chrome extensions page</a>. Enable
Developer mode (top-right corner).</p>

<p>Load-unpacked the <code>extension/</code> folder in this repo.</p>

<p><strong>Make a note of the extension ID Chrome assigns.</strong> Mine is
<code>jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj</code>. We'll use this later.</p>

<h4 id="in-firefox">in Firefox</h4>

<p>You'll need to install as a "temporary extension", so it'll only last
in your current FF session. (TODO: is this fixable? signature stuff?)</p>

<p>Go to <a href="about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox">about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</a>.</p>

<p>Load Temporary Add-on...</p>

<p>Choose manifest.json in the extension subfolder of this repo.</p>

<h3 id="2-install-the-c-filesystem">2. Install the C filesystem</h3>

<p>First, make sure you have FUSE and FUSE headers. On Linux, for example,
<code>sudo apt install libfuse-dev</code> or equivalent. On macOS, get <a href="https://osxfuse.github.io/">FUSE for
macOS</a>.</p>

<p>Then compile the C filesystem:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd fs
$ mkdir mnt
$ make
</code></pre>

<p>Now install the native messaging host into your browser, so the
extension can launch and talk to the filesystem:</p>

<h4 id="chrome-and-chromium">Chrome and Chromium</h4>

<p>Substitute the extension ID you copied earlier for
<code>jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj</code> in the command below.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh chrome jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh chromium jimpolemfaeckpjijgapgkmolankohgj
</code></pre>

<h4 id="firefox">Firefox</h4>

<pre><code>$ ./install.sh firefox
</code></pre>

<h3 id="3-ready">3. Ready!</h3>

<p>Go back to <code>chrome://extensions</code> or
<code>about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</code> and reload the extension.</p>

<p>Now your browser tabs should be mounted in <code>fs/mnt</code>!</p>

<p>Open the background page inspector to see the filesystem operations
stream in. (in Chrome, click "background page" next to "Inspect views"
in the extension's entry in the Chrome extensions page; in Firefox,
click "Inspect")</p>

<p><img src="https://omar.website/tabfs/doc/inspector.png">
</p>

<p>This console is also incredibly helpful for debugging anything that
goes wrong, which probably will happen. (If you get a generic I/O
error at the shell when running a command on TabFS, that probably
means that an exception happened which you can check here.)</p>

<p>(My OS and applications are pretty chatty. They do a lot of
operations, even when I don't feel like I'm actually doing
anything. My sense is that macOS is generally chattier than Linux.)</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

December 31, 2020 | https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Having spent the summer of 2020 testing out various note-taking tools / apps for <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">personal knowledge management (PKM)</a> purposes, there are a few, in my opinion, which really stand out from the rest. One of these is Logseq (<a data-type="URL" data-id="https://logseq.com/" href="https://logseq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link</a>).</p>



<p>Before going into why I believe Logseq is one of the best note-taking apps out there, it might be worth remembering that instinctively when we need to write something down, the first thing we look for is a pen and some paper. When on the phone and we need to take a number down, the other person instinctively says “do you have a pen ready”. I believe this is because pen and paper:</p>



<ul><li>Feels natural,</li><li>Efficient,</li><li>Easy to use,</li><li>Free (minimal cost to owning a piece of paper and a pen),</li><li>Liberal (only the paper edges define the space you have available),</li><li>Ownership (you own it and can do what you want with it).</li></ul>



<p>In essence, you can pick up a pen and some paper and write at your heart’s content.</p>



<p>With that out of the way, let’s get into why Logseq, and why I found it (and think you will too) just as easy to use as pen and paper.</p>



<h2>Why Logseq?</h2>



<p>What makes Logseq what it is, is how the tool came to be, the founder and the team of developers he has with him, in addition to Logseq being a fantastic note-taking tool. The app is still in its early beta days, and there is a lot of development going on, but it is a breeze to use and with each update comes further stability and new features.</p>



<p>The tool came to life as a side project of an immensely friendly chap called Tienson Qin <a href="https://twitter.com/tiensonqin">Twitter</a>. Having notes but nowhere convenient to put them, he developed Logseq. His passion for the tool and the time he takes to answer questions and grow the community are incredible. This passion, time and care are directly transferred to the Logseq tool. It is a true joy to use, and when things don’t go according to plan, you can sense he feels the pain and will look to put things right as soon as possible. The Devs also listen to their users’ comments and feedback and shape the future of the app with these in mind.</p>



<p>Logseq is local first (you are in control of your notes) with notes being saved in plain text files in both Markdown and Org Mode formats means that you are not tied into proprietary software – you can easily transfer your notes somewhere else or even open them with Notepad.</p>



<blockquote><p>The server will never store or analyse your private notes. Even if the website is down or can’t be maintained, your data is always yours.

<p>When visiting Logseq.com we are greeted with a welcome page which highlights what is possible, as shown in the following example:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="660" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?w=1277&amp;ssl=1 1277w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?w=1277&amp;ssl=1 1277w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/logseq-front.png?resize=1024%2C660&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Although the tool by default opens up on the daily journal page (with a new page being created for each day automatically) it is possible to change this by adding “:default-home {:page “WhateverFile”}” before the last “}” to the config file (under settings). This way you can direct the home page to be whatever note page you want.</p>



<h3>Features:</h3>



<p>There are many, many features available in Logseq and I have listed below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Ease of writing notes<em> – open up and off you go</em></li><li>Outliner – <em>Can structure your notes how you wish</em></li><li>Focus mode –<em> click on a bullet point to focus on that text</em></li><li>Collapse / expand –<em> easily expand and collapse blocks of notes to see what is of interest to you in a given moment</em></li><li>Note linking – <em>create links between notes at both a page and block-level</em></li><li>Backlinking –<em> easily see which pages and block link to the page</em></li><li>Sidebar actions – <em>see recent notes or open a note in the sidebar allowing you to work on two notes (or more) at once</em></li><li>Embed block – <em>include an embed of a block in another page where you can edit the contents which will be reflected in the original note</em></li><li>To-do list –<em> easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Graph View – <em>Visualise a page or your notes collection in a graph</em></li><li>Favourites – <em>editable list of favourite notes in an easy to reach location</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video of the things that it can do (<strong>please note that there have been a few changes to Logseq since the video was posted – a new and updated video is being prepared</strong>)</p>

<h3>How I Use Logseq:</h3>



<p>You can use Logseq to take and organise your notes and personal knowledge in a non-linear manner. Use it to manage your to-do list, write your journals or, record the unique moments in your life. A brief overview of how I use it daily is included below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="How I use Logseq Daily - A Roam Research Alternative for Notes / PKM / To Do / Journal" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCIdJBZGQLQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3>True Local Only Experience:</h3>



<p>The introduction of the stable Local Storage option means that it is now possible to store files locally (or Google Drive, OneDrive or DropBox, etc.) instead of having to save the notes in Github. This addition has truly made Logseq local only. I did a quick video overview of this in the following video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Logseq Update for Local File Storage - The Roam Research Alternative for Notes / PKM / To Do" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Afmqowr0qEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If you were one of the early users of Logseq and want to take your notes from your GitHub repo to the local storage, I found the following manner works best:</p>



<ol><li>Go to your Github repo where you save your Logseq notes and on the right-hand side you should see a green “Code” button</li><li>Click this button and then click the last option “Download Zip” (This downloads your notes as a zip file)</li><li>Open the Zip folder you downloaded and copy / extract the contents to the location where your local Logseq directory is set. Copy the Journals from the zip to the journals on your machine and same for pages.</li><li>Go to Logseq.com and click on the refresh icon beside your avatar (top right hand side)</li></ol>



<h3>Pros and Areas of Improvement:</h3>



<p>The things I like about Logseq:</p>



<ol><li>Ease of using the tool and getting started,</li><li>Saves files locally so you are in total control,</li><li>Efficient to jot down something,</li><li>Liberal – can indent at your hearts content and chop and change text / reorder as you wish,</li><li>Easily search for anything you have written,</li><li>Speed of development and a great team behind it,</li><li>Free (donations are possible, see OpenCollective link below for more info).</li></ol>



<p>Do you see the resemblance of the advantages of using Logseq to those described why we typically go for pen and paper?</p>



<p>The things I hope to see in the near future:</p>



<ol><li>Better markdown format so that it is easier to copy and paste text between different applications. It feels a little cumbersome at the moment.</li><li>Desktop / mobile app for even quicker note-taking – this is more a wish rather than an improvement as working via a web browser is ok.</li></ol>

                  <div>
                      <p>One year ago, I was here.</p>
<p>Surrounded by sun, sea, and an endless supply of Mai Tais.</p>
<p>Hanging out on the Big Island of Hawai’i, I had all the trappings of your stereotypical tech worker on the beach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptop that cost as much as my first car? Check.</li>
<li>Dreams of traveling the world? You betcha.</li>
<li>Passive income side hustle? My villa won’t pay for itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize it sounds cliché. But at that moment the only thought going through my mind was, “This is totally going to work”.</p>
<p>It’d been just over a month since I quit my job to become a full-time founder. My partner and I hit our first month of $2K revenue for our software product, landed our biggest customer, and shipped a massive feature users <em>loved</em>.</p>
<p>Then my travel blog had its first $5K month, filling in the financial gaps while I acquired customers for our product.</p>
<p>There we were. On the path to the Promised Land of glory, fame, and monthly recurring revenue.</p>
<p>Yet, in the world’s most obvious plot twist…</p>
<p>None of those things happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/blog/chain-of-craters-road.jpg" alt="Chain of Craters Road"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Narrator: It went downhill from here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="lets-start-with-how-we-got-here">Let’s start with how we got here</h2>
<p>In February 2019, we started building <a href="https://affilimate.com/" target="_blank">Affilimate</a>.</p>
<p>It’s an analytics Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tool for people running blogs and websites that are monetized through
affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Basically, our users link from their websites to recommended products and services, and earn a commission for
any referred sales.</p>
<p>The problem is, those sales happen in dozens of places and have huges holes in the data
that would help people understand what’s actually converting on their site and how to improve it. Our tool solves both those issues.</p>
<p>But as luck would have it in a year like this, our first 70 users on the platform were all running travel blogs. Just like me.</p>
<p>You can probably guess where this is going.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/blog-crash.png" alt="Blog crash"></p>
<p>No travel, no traffic, no money.</p>
<p>When the tourism industry collapsed in March, my blog as my main income source
– and the blogs of all our customers – collapsed, too.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was making less than $500 in profit per month.</p>
<p>No surprise, customers of our SaaS product started asking to pause their subscriptions. Which made total sense – an analytics tool is useless when all the numbers are <em>zero</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sad milestone: <a href="https://twitter.com/affilimateio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@affilimateio</a>'s members' sites are so affected by the change in consumer behavior owing to coronavirus, that it just triggered our monitoring system's alert for low activity 😭</p>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1240603897359675393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>To combat the shock, we gave all our customers 3 months for free. Meanwhile, our costs of running
the platform remained the same.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/affilimate-crash.png" alt="Affilimate crash"></p>
<p>This gave people time to process what was happening psychologically – but also helped us prevent over 90% of our monthly subscribers from churning right away.</p>
<p>We were buying time to figure something out.</p>
<h2 id="no-boss-to-get-you-out-of-bed">No boss to get you out of bed</h2>
<p>By the end of March, I could barely get myself out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>It felt like I’d been pushing a boulder up a hill for a year, only to have it
flatten me like a pancake.</p>
<p>But instead of starting back at the bottom of the hill, I’d rolled further. Into a
syrup-y swamp of stagnation.</p>
<p>No new signups were coming in. My blog income had evaporated. And to top it off, I didn’t have a “normal job” to fall back on.</p>
<p>So I did what any rational person would do in this situation.</p>
<p>I ordered a Nintendo Switch and played <em>Animal Crossing</em> for like 200 hours.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/animal-crossing.png" alt="Animal Crossing vs Motivation"></p>
<p>This went on for several weeks.</p>
<p>After playing through the main game in record time (and watching the first and last video game streams of my life), I knew I couldn’t continue this way.</p>
<p>I had to resurrect our SaaS: find customers in new verticals and people we could help with Affilimate. Get out of this rut and rally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of things sound smart on paper until you actually do them.</p>
<p>Automation and scraping. Content. Cold email. Paid ads. Sponsorships. I tried a lot of things, and none of them really panned out.</p>
<p><strong>I had no scalable, repeatable way to reach new customers in a short amount of time.</strong></p>
<p>By the end of this exercise, I was even more demoralized than before. At that point, I considered consulting work, freelancing, or even getting a remote job.</p>
<p>But the idea of going back to working for a startup felt worse than looking at my bank account.</p>
<p>I had to figure out how to make progress in a way I could <em>control</em>.</p>
<p>Enter my first pandemic side project.</p>
<h2 id="an-article-that-probably-changed-my-life">An article that probably changed my life</h2>
<p>In April, I read an article Amy Hoy wrote about <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/5-rules-content-that-sells/" target="_blank">content marketing</a>.</p>
<p>The upshot is, the most effective content marketing often isn’t blog posts. It’s standalone, mini products. They’re usually free, valuable on their own, and somehow related to your main offering.</p>
<p>This technique is commonly called <em>side project marketing</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/side-project-marketing.png" alt="Side project marketing"></p>
<p>And it’s weird to say this, but Amy’s article kind of changed my life.</p>
<p>Most business advice says you need to do one thing and make it succeed by willpower, determination, and unrelenting focus.</p>
<p><strong>It felt like permission to try something different.</strong></p>
<p>Admittedly, the project I was about to build was only tangentially related to Affilimate. But I saw it as opportunity to start fresh, and apply what I’d been learning for the last 18 months.</p>
<p>So I took this advice and launched a new side project.</p>
<p>It went better than I ever expected.</p>
<h2 id="whats-different-when-you-try-a-second-time">What’s different when you try a second time</h2>
<p>Unlike with my SaaS, I had a distribution plan from the outset.</p>
<p>About 9,000 developers followed me on Twitter, built up from years of blogging and some speaking at tech conferences.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’d never really wanted to build a product for developers before. But that didn’t matter. The goal was to test and learn as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Leveraging the audience I already had was the fastest way to make it happen.</p>
<p>So I created <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank">Blogging for Devs</a> as an email course. It teaches developers about blogging and SEO by helping them create an optimized blog post in 7 days.</p>
<p>Keeping it lean, I launched with a single-page site: a couple paragraphs, a screenshot from my Google Analytics, an opt-in form, and a few words about myself. It was a Friday in the middle of May.</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey y'all! If you didn't catch it last week, I'm starting a free newsletter to teach devs about blogging, SEO, and writing content.</p><p>The 7-day kick-off challenge starts THIS WEEKEND, so join in if you're looking for a kick in the keister 😁 Happy Friday! <a href="https://t.co/PNlwM428R4">https://t.co/PNlwM428R4</a></p></div>— Monica Lent (@monicalent) <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1261311666303705090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a>
</blockquote>

<p>The email list grew to 1,200 subscribers before the end of the month. I kept it going as a newsletter, and from there it grew mostly by word of mouth. It’s just hit 5,000 active subscribers.</p>
<p>The newsletter went on to become #1 Product of the Day when I <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/product-hunt-launch/" target="_blank">launched on Product Hunt</a> in August, thanks to kind comments and support from people who liked the email course.</p>
<p>Finally, I created a <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/pro/" target="_blank">paid community</a> for subscribers. It’s made over $10K in 6 weeks since the public launch in November.</p>
<p>We just reached $1K in monthly recurring revenue (MRR).</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/bfd-launch.png" alt="Blogging for Devs"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: It still took me 6 months to go from newsletter launch to meaningful revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twice the MRR, twice the revenue, half the time of my SaaS.</p>
<p>Even though I never planned a crossover between these two products, I do plan to take my learnings and apply them to Affilimate in 2021.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good, right?</p>
<p>From the borderline broke to a successful launch and meaningful revenue, just in time for my 2020 retrospective!</p>
<p>Hold that thought.</p>
<h2 id="a-reality-check-for-aspiring-bootstrappers">A reality check for aspiring bootstrappers</h2>
<p>Since launching my community this year (in particular since my <a href="https://twitter.com/monicalent/status/1331962236680736768" target="_blank">accidental Hacker News launch</a>),
I’ve received a lot of tweets and emails from people who aspire to “do what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>But I’m afraid people get the wrong
idea of both my personal situation, and the financial reality for many bootstrappers.</p>
<p>$10K in 6 weeks sounds pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>But it’s the only “real money” I’ve made all year.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/income-summary-cumulative.png" alt="Bootstrapping income summary"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you turn 30 and only make $538 for the entire month. You start to question a hell of a lot of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also can’t forget how much someone with a background like mine could make at an established company.</p>
<p>Before having the bright idea to build my own products, I was the frontend engineering lead and manager
at a unicorn fintech company in Berlin. Which brings me to my next point:</p>
<p><strong>The only reason I can afford to do any of this is because I have savings.</strong></p>
<p>It also helps that my blog was still profitable.
The 4 years of work I invested in growing my travel blog ended up covering a lot of my business expenses, even during a pandemic.</p>
<p><img src="https://monicalent.com/images/retro/income-summary.png" alt="Bootstrapping income summary"></p>
<p>But then there’s rent, food, health insurance, and shit
you’ve just got to buy.</p>
<p>That means the entire year will be a financial net negative for me, even if my businesses technically made money.
As it turns out, things don’t magically pay for themselves once you’re bootstrapping. Who knew?</p>
<p>The point I want to make is this:</p>
<p>Launching new projects, sharing how it went, and making <em>any</em> kind of money looks great on Twitter. It feels great, too.</p>
<p>Just don’t forget to zoom out for the full story.</p>
<p>$5,000 in revenue from “people on the internet” might seem totally different than $5,000 from “a normal job”.</p>
<p>But both of those buy exactly the same amount of ramen.</p>
<h2 id="theres-no-prize-for-doing-it-the-hard-way">There’s no prize for doing it the hard way</h2>
<p>If I had to sum up my biggest lesson from 2020, it’s this:</p>
<p><strong>Distribution is everything.</strong></p>
<p>You can have an amazing product that solves a ton of problems. But if you can’t find a
scalable, repeatable way to help people find it, you’re toast.</p>
<p>It gets harder when you enter a totally new industry with no network, no reputation, and no unfair advantages.
Which is basically what I was doing with Affilimate.</p>
<p>I don’t have an audience for that product: bloggers and affiliate marketers.</p>
<p>My audience is developers. This time, I made something for them.</p>
<p>An existing audience is just one of many potential distribution channels. But I’ve seen what a huge advantage it can be to start with one, <em>as long as that audience is also your target customer</em>.</p>
<p>There will be people who think any sort of success doesn’t count unless you begin as a “nobody”, with no …</p></div></section></div>

        <p>How the 911 system operates, at least in the US</p>
<p>Also, apologies on the formatting, was doing this on mobile while waiting for a car detail</p>
<p>I’m a 911 dispatcher for a smallish Texas suburb in the DFW metroplex. Be 4 years in June.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there’s a lot of misinformation on how 911 works. Here’s some things I think people should know</p>
<ol>
<li>Contrary to movies and TV, we don’t always magically know where you are. In many cases, we don’t have a clue. I’ve had countless callers that simply say “I need the police” or “I need an ambulance” and then hang up. And then they refuse to answer my callbacks. So now, I have a 911 request and have to do a bunch of guesswork to figure out where 911 is needed which can greatly delay the response. How do I do that?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the ping info. All 911 calls that come into my agency have varying degrees of location information. Varying is the key word. It can be as accurate as 5 meters to a specific house or 2000 meters off a cell tower. And this only works from the time the phone dials into 911 to the time the phone hangs up. The longer we have someone on the line, the more likely we get accurate location information but it’s not a certainty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the number for prior history. We have frequent flyers that we know. I’ve got callers I’ve dealt with enough that I often have an idea of what’s going on the second I see the number pop up on my Callworks. But this is no guarantee. Someone visiting from out of town isn’t likely going to have history in my city</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If those two steps don’t yield the results I’m looking for, I move on to checking with the phone carriers. T-Mobile, Verizon, and ATT all have numbers I can call to get subscriber information(name, address on the account) and can get them to ping the phone so we can try to get location information. This location info is given via map coordinates(latitude/longitude), not exact locations. From here, I plug the coordinates into Google Maps and hope for the best. Problem here is that many phones that dial 911 aren’t owned by the same people who initially registered the account. For example, a parent who gives their son or daughter a phone. The subscriber information may show an address in a completely different city. And the ping information we get can be unreliable as well. Just last night, I had T-Mobile ping a phone of an elderly who went missing. The ping location had an accuracy radius of 1500 meters and the ping coordinates where in the middle of a nearby lake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninitialized phones are a death trap. These phones are phones that aren’t technically active. They don’t have a SIM card or an active account with a carrier. Think something like a prepaid phone or a random old cell phone in a drawer. By law, any cell phone must be capable of dialing 911. However, these numbers cannot be called back. If you call from one of these phones, you can be in the process of being murdered and there’s little I can do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can be in a completely different city and get my agency. Due to the layout of cell towers, I get 911 requests from 5 or 6 cities around me. This is usually rectified by simply transferring the caller to the appropriate agency. However, it does happen that my city might share similar street addresses. Meaning you might rattle off an address that comes up in my CAD but is in another city entirely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone takes anything from this post, take this......</p>
<p>Know your location. The city you’re in. Look for street signs, businesses....anything that can help me find you faster.</p>
<p>If you’re in someone’s house, look for mail. Check the fridge. Check someone’s wallet even. Pull it up on Google Maps if you can.</p>
<p>The most important thing you can do in an emergency is give me accurate location information. Knowing exactly where you are means I can get help to you a lot faster than if I’m going through the above steps to find you.</p>
<p>People have died because they didn’t know where they were and the 911 system couldn’t find them in time. Things have gotten a lot better in just the 3.5 years I’ve been working as a dispatcher but there still isn’t 100% certainty I can find someone in a crisis</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Text to 911 is a thing. This can be especially useful for women in dangerous situations but anyone can utilize it. The short of it is you, quite literally, text 911. We’re gonna ask all the same questions we would of a regular voice call and treat it exactly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>911 operators experience PTSD at similar rates as police officers and firefighters. Even though we don’t see the emergencies, we don’t see the dead bodies, 911 operators experience PTSD the same way police and fire fighters do. Turns out just hearing these tragedies can do a number on your psyche. Despite this, 911 operators are classified by the Federal government as “Clerical” workers, not “first responders” and even some of our police and fire coworkers treat us a little more than secretaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My agency has done some work to rectify the latter by making police officers sit in Dispatch and work a shift with us, taking calls, working the radio etc.....95% of the officers will tell us “I don’t know you do that every day, I’m sorry I was asshole on the radio”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My manager and the relatively new police chief are both fairly progressive, by law enforcement standards anyway, in that they take mental health seriously and they are more than willing to help someone who is struggling. Whether it’s time off or getting someone into contact with the right people, they’ll what they can.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>No dispatch operates the same way. For my city, of about 70k people, we typically have anywhere from 2-4 dispatchers on a 12 hour shift. A typical breakdown for a day shift would be 4 dispatchers. 1 works PD radio, one works FD radio, one works the Traffic channel, and one is first up for 911 and admin phones. However, the PD and FD dispatchers are still required to answer 911 if the need arises. Meaning you can be working an active incident like a police chase or structure fire and still have to answer 911 and give CPR instructions while somehow managing to give both situations your undivided attention.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other cities, though, especially the larger ones, have dedicated call takers, dedicated dispatchers, dedicated NCIC(warrants, stolen vehicles etc) operators that focus solely on their responsibilities and aren’t required to multi task like I am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I work nights meaning that 11 or 12 midnight, we’re down to 3 dispatchers. Sometimes just 2. But by 2am, we’re down to 2 all the time. The vast majority of the time, for that late, 2 is enough. But a single major incident like a structure fire can make things pretty tense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So if you call 911, and your call taker sounds a bit distracted, chances are he or she isn’t actually distracted or bad at their job but is trying to balance your call with radio traffic. It ain’t easy listening to and processing two sources of audio simultaneously, being able to create and call for service and put call notes in, and do whatever an officer or firefighter might need at a moments notice</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all I can think of for now. If anyone has any specific questions about anything, feel free to drop them here or in a DM.</p>

        <p>This is an absolutely incredible response. Thank you so much for taking the time to type it all out and share it, and thank you again for doing a very difficult and very under-appreciated job. I used to know a dispatcher who would share some of her experiences with us, and some of the stories she told shook me to my core. What you do requires incredible fortitude and resolve.</p>
<p>One thing to add that has come in handy for me, as someone from the other side of the call: being aware of mile-markers while highway driving. When I first started learning to drive, knowing where I was on any given road was drilled into me as a part of my situational awareness. I no longer keep track of them like I used to (nearly every second I was behind the wheel), but the moment anything out of the ordinary happens, I immediately check the nearest mile marker in the event that there's an emergency. Most times nothing comes of it, but the few times I've had to call 911 while driving (due to witnessing cars going off the road, accidents, or outright hazardous drivers), I'm able to immediately identify the exact location to the dispatcher, which they seem to appreciate.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This article is a comprehensive guide to the <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno106.php">Roland Juno</a>'s <strong>digitally-controlled analog oscillators</strong> (<em>DCOs</em>). I fell in love with the Juno early in my synthesizer journey and I've spent the last year or so doing research on its design so that I could create my own Juno-inspired DCO, <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-castor-and-pollux">Winterbloom's <em>Castor &amp; Pollux</em></a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Juno logo" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-logo.png"></p>
<p>This article will cover a little history of the Juno, discuss the theory of operation behind digital-controlled oscillators, analyze the circuit designs for the Juno 6/60 &amp; the Juno 106, and discuss practical aspects of using DCOs. This article is somewhat lengthy and there is a <em>lot</em> of information here. I've tried my best to make this approachable for anyone with <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/engineering_essentials">basic electronics knowledge</a>, so if you feel confused or overwhelmed please <a href="mailto:me@thea.codes">reach out</a> and I'll be more than happy to include more details or change something so that it's easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-history">A little history</h2>
<p>Roland introduced the incredible <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno6.php">Juno-6</a> and nearly identical <a href="http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno60.php">Juno-60</a> in 1982. The Juno was a 6-voice polyphonic synthesizer that was an incredible value considering its array of features.</p>
<p><img alt="A photo of the Juno-60" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-60.jpg"></p>
<p>The Juno notably featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitally_controlled_oscillator"><em>digitally-controlled analog oscillators</em></a>. The DCO was designed to overcome the tuning instability of the usual <strong>voltage-controlled oscillators</strong> (<em>VCOs</em>) in contemporary polyphonic synthesizers. The DCOs operate with the same fundamental analog circuitry but differ in that they are controlled by a microcontroller. This imparted a unique sound to the Juno series and one that's become a favorite of many musicians.</p>
<p><img alt="A photo of the Juno 106" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/juno-106.jpg"></p>
<p>Roland followed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-106">Juno-106</a> in 1984. It offered some feature upgrades over its predecessor such as pitch bend, modulation, and support for a new thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>. It still used the same digitally-controlled oscillator concept from the 6 &amp; 60, but its implementation is a little bit different.</p>
<p>This article will discuss and analyze both designs, but before getting into the nitty-gritty details let's take a look at the overall sound generation design of the Juno. Also, this article will refer to these three synthesizers - the 6, 60, and 106 - as <strong>the Juno</strong>, but note that this isn't necessarily applicable to later models.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview-of-the-junos-sound-generation">An overview of the Juno's sound generation</h2>
<p>The Juno has six voices. Each voice has a single oscillator that can generate three different <em>waveforms</em>. These oscillators are controlled by the microcontroller. Here's a block diagram that should help visualize the different parts at play:</p>
<p><img alt="A block diagram of a DCO-based synth" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/dco-block.png"></p>
<p>Sound generation starts with a <em>square</em> wave controlled by the microntroller and then goes through a series of <em>waveshapers</em> which generates a <em>ramp/sawtooth</em> waveform, a <em>sub</em> waveform (which is a square wave at half the frequency), and a <em>pulse</em> waveform. The frequency of the clock determines the frequency/note that the oscillator plays.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to a common design for a voltage-controlled oscillator (<em>VCO</em>) where a CPU isn't required. Instead, it uses analog circuitry to create a <em>control voltage</em> which determines the oscillator's frequency:</p>
<p><img alt="A block diagram of a VCO-based synth" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/vco-block.png"></p>
<p>Now that you've got a high-level overview of the sound generation inside of these synthesizers, let's take a deeper look at the components involved in sound generation.</p>
<h2 id="the-ramp-generator">The ramp generator</h2>
<p>Before jumping into the difference between DCOs and VCOs it's useful to discuss the similarities. As shown in the block diagrams above several designs for VCOs <strong>and</strong> the Juno DCOs are designed around a <strong>ramp generator</strong> (sometimes referred to as a <em>ramp core</em>) which creates a <em>sawtooth</em> (ramp) waveform:</p>
<p><img alt="A sawtooth waveform" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/ramp.png"></p>
<p>The ramp generator is the beginning of how an oscillator turns a <em>frequency input signal</em> into the various useful waveforms that are used to make musical sounds. For a VCO, the frequency input signal is a <strong>control voltage</strong>, hence "voltage-controlled". For a DCO, the frequency input signal is a <strong>digital clock</strong>, hence "digitally-controlled".</p>
<p>The difference in the type of input signal has a significant impact on the circuit design. Before getting into those differences, let's look at the heart of the ramp generator that's shared between both designs: the <strong>integrator</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="the-integrator">The integrator</h2>
<p>An integrator is a electronic circuit that performs the mathematical operation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"><em>Integration</em></a>. This is a fancy word from calculus but don't be afraid- it's actually pretty straightforward in practice.</p>
<p>The purpose of an integrator is to produce an output signal that changes (increase or decreases) at a rate that corresponds to the magnitude and duration of the input signal. In this case the input and output signals are both voltage. If you apply a <strong>constant</strong> voltage to an integrator, it will create a consistent increase or decrease in the output voltage over time (a <em>ramp</em>):</p>
<p><img alt="An ideal integrator" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-ramp.png"></p>
<p>More voltage means that the ramp will have a steeper slope. This is going to be helpful in generating a sawtooth waveform- the integrator ramp produces exactly one cycle of a sawtooth waveform. The trick is getting it to restart so that it creates a repeating (or <em>periodic</em>) sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>You can create an integrator using an <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/opamp/opamp_6.html">op-amp integrator circuit</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="A basic op-amp integrator circuit" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/op-amp-integrator.png"></p>
<p>The op-amp integrator is based on the idea that if you apply a voltage to a capacitor it <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capchg.html">takes some time to charge</a>, in fact, it will charge at a rate that is proportional to the input voltage which sounds a <em>lot</em> like integration! Without going into too much op-amp theory, you can just assume that the integrator circuit will produce a voltage that increases or decreases at a rate determined by the input voltage and the values of <code>R</code> and <code>C</code>. The values of <code>R</code> and <code>C</code> determine the <a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/rc/rc_1.html"><strong>RC constant</strong></a> of the integrator - or put more simply, <em>how long it takes the circuit to charge up</em>. Remember this concept because it comes into play a <em>lot</em> in this article.</p>
<p>You can play around this with interactive illustration to see how changing the voltage, resistance, or capacitance changes the output of the integrator:</p>
<canvas id="integrator" width="1000" height="600"></canvas>


<p>The formula used to determine the output voltage of an integrator with a constant input voltage at a given time is:</p>
<pre><span>Vout</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>(</span><span>Vin</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>R</span> <span>*</span> <span>C</span><span>))</span> <span>*</span> <span>time</span>
</pre>
<p>Before going further, there are some interesting and noteworthy properties of the integrator's behavior to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, notice that there are three ways of changing the steepness of the output's slope: changing the capacitance, changing the resistance, or changing the voltage. Making the voltage higher will charge the capacitor more quickly and increase the steepness of the slope. Making the resistance or capacitance lower will also cause the capacitor to charge more quickly and will increase the steepness of the slope.</li>
<li>Second, the output is <strong>inverted</strong> - a positive input voltage creates a downward slope and a negative input voltage creates an upward slope. This will come into play when we look at the difference between the Juno-6/60 design and the Juno-106 design.</li>
<li>Third, notice that with steeper slopes the output will <em>saturate</em> (stop increasing or decreasing). This is because a real op amp doesn't have an infinite amount of voltage to output and the capacitor can't hold an infinite amount of charge, so when either the output voltage is beyond the op amp's power supply or the capacitor can't hold any more charge the output voltage will saturate.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you should hopefully have a good grasp on how an op-amp integrator forms a ramp from a constant input voltage. So now we'll see how to change the circuit so that instead of a single slope it generates a repeating (periodic) sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>A straightforward solution is to just start the circuit over - <strong>reset</strong> it. That'll start the ramp back at zero and let it start rising (or falling) again. If you keep resetting at regular intervals the circuit will keep generating ramps and which form cycles of the sawtooth waveform.</p>
<p>But what does it mean to reset a circuit? Well, it means to put it back into its initial state. Think about what <em>changes</em> in the integrator circuit over time: the <strong>charge</strong> of the capacitor. When the circuit first starts the capacitor has no charge and the output voltage is zero, but, as time goes on the capacitor charges more and more. So resetting the circuit means <em>discharging</em> the capacitor.</p>
<p>The easiest way to discharge a capacitor is to <em>short</em> it: connect its two leads together so there's nothing blocking it from discharging. You can do that by putting a little switch in the circuit:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a switch to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-switch.png"></p>
<p>When the switch is open the integrator behaves the same as before - its output goes up or down depending on the input voltage. When the switch is closed, it creates a circuit that connects the capacitor's leads and allows it to discharge:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a switch to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-switch-closed.png"></p>
<p>Once the switch is opened again the integrator starts over and begins ramping its output again.</p>
<p>Try out the little simulation below - press <code>start</code> to let the capacitor charge for a little bit and then press <code>close switch</code> to reset it:</p>
<canvas id="discharge" width="1000" height="600"></canvas>


<p>Take notice that when you press the button at consistent intervals the output is a sawtooth waveform and its frequency is determined by how often you press the button and reset the capacitor.</p>
<p>Obviously there aren't any synthesizers out there that require you to manually tap a switch at the desired note's frequency!<sup id="fnref:fast"><a href="#fn:fast">1</a></sup> So instead of requiring a person to press a switch this circuit should take some form of <strong>frequency input signal</strong> and use it to electronically close the switch.</p>
<p>The switch is the easy part - there's a well-known component that can act as an <em>electronically-controlled switch</em>: the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors/all">transistor</a>. So, the ramp generator will use a transistor in place of the switch:</p>
<p><img alt="An op-amp integrator with a transistor to discharge the capacitor" src="https://blog.thea.codes/static/juno/integrator-with-transistor.png"></p>
<p>Note that I am explicitly not specifying which kind of transistor (PNP, NPN etc)- which one you choose depends on a few other factors so for now I'll keep it abstract. Notice that there's also a new resistor there between the capacitor and the transistor. This is generally a low-value resistor and it's just there to limit the current that goes through the transistor when the capacitor discharges as too much current could damage the transistor.</p>
<p>So now the circuit has a means of electronically resetting the capacitor. The next step is to create a circuit that takes a frequency input signal …</p></div></div>

<p>The United Kingdom's Brexit transition period expired at 11pm last night, ending a 48-year history with the European project.</p>
<p>New <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/1228/1186705-brexit-eu/" target="_blank">trading rules now apply</a> between Britain and the EU.</p>
<p>Speaking on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the destiny of the UK now lies firmly in its people's hands.</p>
<p>He said his government would take on the duty "with a sense of purpose and with the interests of the British public at the heart of everything" it&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson spoke of wanting a new relationship with the EU as its biggest ally, after <a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/1230/1186933-brexit/" target="_blank">MPs approved the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement yesterday with an overwhelming majority in a House of Commons vote</a>.</p>
<p>17.4 million voters, or 52%&nbsp;opted to leave the EU in a referendum on 23 June 2016.&nbsp;16.1 million, or 48%, voted to remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of that referendum has dominated British politics ever since and seen the departure of two Prime Ministers,&nbsp;David Cameron and Theresa May,&nbsp;as debate raged about whether another referendum should be called, and how the result of the 2016 vote should be implemented.</p>
<p>The referendum showed a United Kingdom divided about much more than the European Union, and has fuelled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism, empire and modern Britishness.</p>
<p>After the United Kingdom leaves the Single Market and&nbsp;the Customs Union tonight, there is almost certain to be some disruption at borders. More red tape means more cost for those importing and exporting goods across the EU-UK border.</p>
<p>The English Port of Dover expects volumes to drop off in early January. The most worrisome period, it says, will be in mid&nbsp;to late January when volumes pick up again.</p>
<p>Walking away from almost half a century of membership means change to everything from pet passports and driving licence rules for the British in Europe to data rules.</p><hr>
<p><b><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/brexit/" target="_blank">Latest Brexit stories</a></b></p>
<hr>
<p>After clinching a Christmas Eve trade deal intended to smooth out the worst disruption, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted both William Shakespeare and TS&nbsp;Eliot.</p>
<p>"Parting is such sweet sorrow," she said. "What we call the beginning is often the end. And to make an end is to make a beginning."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/00110cec-614.jpg?ratio=1.78"></p>
<p><b>Deal reached to keep Gibraltar border open</b></p>
<p>Gibraltar's border with Spain will remain open following the end of the Brexit transition period,&nbsp;after the UK and European Union agreed a draft deal.</p>
<p>The Rock's status was not covered in the trade agreement reached by Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve, prompting concerns about what would happen when the transition period ends at 11pm tonight.</p>
<p>Gibraltar, whose sovereignty is disputed by Spain and Britain, will remain subject to the rule of the free-travel Schengen area, Spain's foreign minister said.</p>
<p>Arancha Gonzalez Laya announced that the "agreement in principle" means people in Gibraltar "can breathe a sigh of relief".</p>
<p>She said that further details on the agreement would be published in the New Year.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "Today, working side by side with the chief minister of Gibraltar, and following intensive discussions with the Spanish government, we reached agreement on a political framework to form the basis of a separate treaty between the UK and the EU regarding Gibraltar.</p>
<p>"We will now send this to the European Commission, in order to initiate negotiations on the formal treaty.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, all sides are committed to mitigating the effects of the end of the transition period on Gibraltar, and in particular ensure border fluidity, which is clearly in the best interests of the people living on both sides.</p>
<p>"We remain steadfast in our support for Gibraltar and its sovereignty. I am grateful to foreign minister Laya and her team for their positive and constructive approach.</p>
<p>"We have a warm and strong relationship with Spain, and we look forward to building on it in 2021."&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minister updates Cabinet of impact on fishing</b></p>
<p>The Minister for Agriculture has&nbsp;said that&nbsp;while trade can continue tariff-free, he updated the cabinet on the potential impacts on the agri-food and fishing sectors earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The main impacts in relation to administrative costs in doing trade with Britain and also health certification and SPS checks which agri-food products have to undergo," Charlie McConalogue said.</p>
<p>"There is differing assessments in what that might mean," he added.</p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ's Today with Philip Boucher Hayes, he said there has been significant support assured already in advance of Brexit for the agri-food sector in terms of grant aid and financial support.</p>
<p>He also said post-Brexit he will be going to Brussels to fight the Irish case as strongly as possible for the fisheries sector.</p>
<p>"The Brexit adjustment reserve, we will be looking for our significant share of that in terms of the compensation.</p>
<p>"Also, in terms of working with my European colleagues to ensure we have a strong allocation of quota as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Revenue has confirmed that its specialised Customs Service is already operating in advance of the Brexit transition period ending tonight</p>
<p>From 11pm a valid Pre-Boarding Notification (PBN) is required for all goods carried by commercial vehicles to and from Britain by ferry.</p>
<p>Revenue says its Customs Roll on-Roll off (RoRo) Service is up and running and a transport company, haulier, importer, exporter or customs agent can create a PBN for any ferry due to sail after 11pm.</p>
<p>The Customs RoRo Service was designed to help efficiently move goods and vehicles between Ireland and Great Britain.</p>
<p>The service also allows truck drivers to check, prior to disembarking a ferry in Ireland, if a vehicle can exit the port or if it is required to call to Customs.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Squeakin' in at the finish line of 2020, Perfect Media Server is back! </p><p>The 5th anniversary of the series is in February and to celebrate I have prepared a complete overhaul of the material and would like to present a brand new home both for the blog posts (this blog) and <a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/">perfectmediaserver.com</a>.</p><blockquote><a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/">perfectmediaserver.com</a> is the new home of the series.</blockquote><p>The new site is a wiki and will guide new and experienced users through the process of selecting the software and hardware to build a Perfect Media Server of their own. </p><p>It represents 100's of hours worth of work and aims to lower the barrier of entry for some of you to building your own PMS and to help spread the good word about Free and Open-Source Software. The site has a lot of the fundamentals completed but expect to see some work in progress labels here and there - they'll disappear over the next few weeks.</p><p>So what does this mean for the annual blog posts? Great question!</p><p>These blogs posts will now serve as an annual opinion piece on the state of the Perfect Media Server solution and chronicle any major changes that occurred throughout the year. Also on the agenda will be discussing the general state of Self-Hosting too. I do this regularly on the <a href="https://selfhosted.show/">Self-Hosted</a> podcast anyway so why not bring the highlights to the fore each year.</p><p>And now, on with the blog post...</p><h2 id="the-2020-edition">The 2020 edition</h2><p>Phewf, what a year. I don't know about you but the stay home orders have meant I've had more time to tinker and perfect things than ever before. However, I find that this entire system is so reliable that each year when it comes to write the post I find myself thinking "OK, it still just works. But that doesn't make for such great content. So... What do I even write about?".</p><p>I know that things are very stable and reliable for many of you too because you find me and tell me via <a href="https://selfhosted.show/discord">Discord</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/IronicBadger">Twitter</a>. Several times a month I get contacted asking if <a href="https://perfectmediaserver.com/">PMS</a> is still relevant in 2020 and the answer is yes! Absolutely, yes.</p><p>You can find the previous incarnations of PMS below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://blog.linuxserver.io/2016/02/02/the-perfect-media-server-2016/">Perfect Media Server (2016 Edition) - The Original Solution</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.linuxserver.io/2017/06/24/the-perfect-media-server-2017/">Perfect Media Server (2017 Edition) - From scratch installation with extensive video guides</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/07/16/perfect-media-server-2019/">Perfect Media Server (2019 Edition) - Boring is reliable and adding ZFS to the mix</a></li></ul><p>This year though it occurred to me that yet another blog post on it's own might not be that useful. However, a properly curated, open-source site with first class search and some kind of structure was the way forward.</p><h2 id="the-great-debate">The Great Debate</h2><p>Xbox vs Playstation. Gas vs Electric. Pragmatism vs Idealism. Build vs Buy. Emacs vs Vim. Unraid vs PMS. These are truly the great debates of our time. </p><p>In the end, there is no right or wrong answer and the only person who can decide which works best for you, is you. That said, there are plenty of reasons why rolling your solution might just be a better idea.</p><h2 id="cost-and-flexibility">Cost and Flexibility</h2><p>One might be forgiven for valuing the overall cost of a solution as the pain inflicted upon their wallet. But there is much more to it than that. </p><p>Of course, cost can be quantified financially but also consider the world altering power of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Every piece of software used to bring this text to your eyeballs is an open source project (Linux, Ghost, docker, docker-compose, nginx, rsync, mkdocs, Joplin, emacs + org-mode, QEMU, Proxmox etc).</p><p>Open Source is a gift and as such, supporting it wherever possible will lead to the betterment of humanity. Formula 1 even announced an open-source <a href="https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/teams-open-source-designs-proposal/4552509/">design initiative</a>, wow!</p><p>By rolling your own solution you are investing in yourself. You are learning skills that will make you more likely to interview well if you'd like to get a job working with Linux. In my opinion, this angle is all too often completely overlooked when picking a solution. The skills I learned building the original Perfect Media Server lead to several wonderful, life-changing situations and it is my hope that comparable opportunities are afforded to my readers and others undertaking a similar path.</p><p>Let us next consider money. A license for UnRaid costs $59-129 depending on how many hard drives you connect to it. A Synology or QNAP box will have an associated "tax" to cover the R&amp;D costs of their Operating System maintenance and development. Here's an awkward question though, what happens when these companies stop supporting these products or are acquired?</p><blockquote>"That'll never happen!"<br> - You at some moment in time</blockquote><p>Sadly though, these types of scenarios are much more likely to occur than we like to admit and there are countless examples in just the last 10 years. You must also consider what happens if the new owners decide to kill off your favourite product (Google are <em>the worst</em> for this). Perhaps they aren't making enough money because one-off license or hardware purchases are just that, one-offs.</p><p>It's a lottery in this scenario as to what happens next. Maybe the source code will be released and the open source community will take it over, maybe it won't. Why take the risk? It might make sense if there weren't viable alternatives but lucky for you, you're reading this article.</p><p>My final argument in relation to cost is a lack of flexibility. By using a specific vendors product you are deferring many important decisions to them. Sometimes this is good, sometimes not.</p><p>In 2016 PMS was running ‘bare metal’. In other words, it was the primary OS installed on the system. Fast forward to today and I’ve moved the installation from bare metal to a VM in Proxmox and last Autumn to VM under VMware ESXi. More on this later.</p><p>In the <a href="https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/07/16/perfect-media-server-2019/">2019 edition</a> I decided that whilst JBOD + SnapRAID parity was good enough for my ephemeral media collection, I wanted to enjoy some of the benefits of ZFS for my irreplaceable bits and bytes. Because PMS is 'just regular Linux', ZFS was just a single package install away. No waiting for a plug-in to be developed or for the vendor "officially" support it.</p><p>Technically Unraid can run ZFS, but it literally required a <a href="https://forum.level1techs.com/t/zfs-on-unraid-lets-do-it-bonus-shadowcopy-setup-guide-project/148764">Wendell</a> to figure it out -it is just Linux under the hood after all. Some of this lack of flexibility comes from the unique USB boot method employed by Lime Technology. They ship Unraid this way to make it more n00b friendly and easier to troubleshoot but paradoxically have created a unicorn that only they and their (honestly pretty great) community are intimately familiar with.</p><p>This is in contrast to using Ubuntu where almost any issue you encounter is not unique. You are probably able to Google yourself to an answer relatively quickly. Plus LTS releases, like 20.04, are guaranteed 5 years of maintenance updates from Canonical. I know of no such <em>guarantee</em> from Lime Technology, Synology, Q-NAP or other NAS vendor.</p><blockquote>Under the guise of simplicity we create elegant abstractions whilst inadvertently often making things harder to fix. Remember that cost is not just financial.</blockquote><p>The flexibility afforded to you by using full-blown Linux is vast. It is that flexibility which has enabled PMS to last me for 4 years and counting. The PMS system changes and adapts as I do.</p><h3 id="infrastructure-as-code-and-docker-compose">Infrastructure as Code and docker-compose</h3><p>A few years ago, I read a book called <a href="https://amzn.to/2WjBb5c">Infrastructure as Code</a> by Kief Moris. In this book, Kief lays out a framework for defining every part of your infrastructure in text files - or as we sometimes call it, code. This simple philosophy of managing configuration in the same manner as source code revolutionized the way I approach building systems. Tools like Ansible and Terraform may seem overkill for your average media server administrator but I firmly believe they have their place. An afternoon or two learning Ansible, and that is all it takes, will save you dozens of future afternoons scratching your head wondering how you accomplished something 3 weeks, 3 months or 3 years ago. We already covered improved job prospects but these skills are in demand, just do a quick Google search for "DevOps Engineer" jobs.</p><p>Readers frequently ask me "Which GUI do you recommend for docker?" and my answer is always <code>docker-compose</code>, which understandbly confuses folks as this isn't a GUI at all. This opinion is born out of countless times rebuilding boxes of my own and of others. If you've used a GUI you'll be able to relate to the tedium of clicking and typing over and over again, often guessing at the required input and having no way other than screenshots! to remember what you did. GUIs might feel as if they make the initial set up of a system easier but in the long run, they will bite you and be more difficult to maintain.</p><p>Let's now examine the supportability angle for a moment. Put yourself in the shoes of a friendly internet stranger helping you with something via a Discord chat or forum post to fix a problem with a container. It's likely they'll have to ask you to share the parameters used when creating that container. At some point, they're likely to ask you for a screenshot of the web interface of your NAS software or to paste a <code>docker-compose</code> yaml snippet. The yaml snippet is easier for you to share, easier for others to read and debug and also means you can't forget the variables used when creating that container. Reverse engineering a random <code>docker run</code> command from 6 months ago is no fun.</p><p>Recovering from a disaster is easier with a text file too. A backup can be as simple as copying and pasting a file to a Github repository. How do you backup a GUI? Maybe it's possible, maybe not. We can extend this philosophy well beyond just the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file. What about file sharing configuration via Samba? Users? Packages installed? Bash aliases? Monitoring configurations? The list goes on. Using Ansible 100% of the answers to these questions are stored in my <a href="https://github.com/ironicbadger/infra">IronicBadger/infra</a> git repo. Using two or three commands it is trivial to take a vanilla Ubuntu installation to fully functional media server in only a few minutes.</p><p>Your server will never be "finished". It is a living, breathing manifestation of your tinkering and learning. Infrastructure as Code allows …</p></div></section></div>

                <div><p>
                  The Japanese language, called 日本語（にほんご）[knee-hohn-go] is composed of 2 major syllabaries, <strong>Hiragana and Katakana.</strong> Made up of <strong>Consonant-Vowel pairs</strong> [ka, ga, ta, su, mu] as opposed to single letters that can be combined in variety, Hiragana and Katakana are two versions of the same collection, Katakana being used for <strong>foreign loan words</strong> since the reorganization of public education in 1962.</p><p>
                  In addition to Hiragana (the native script) and Katakana (reserved for foreign loan-words post-62), Japan imported symbolic glyphs from mainland Asia and they are referred to as 漢字（かんじ） kanji — letters of the Han Dynasty.
              </p></div>
                <p>

            The カタカナ [katakana] are sharp and angular, and while letters to friends have been written entirely in Katakana (and Kanji), <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Masabumi_Hosono_titanic_diary.jpg">such as this beautiful letter recovered from the Titanic,</a> since 1962 the カタカナ [katakana] have been reserved for foreign loan-words such as "computer" コンピュータ [konpyuuta] and "glass" ガラス [garasu].  <br>カタカナ [katakana] have a one-to-one correlation with the ひらがな [hiragana] similar to how English has print and cursive.

          <h4>Kanji 漢字（かんじ）</h4>
          <p>
           The 漢字（かんじ） [kanji] were imported lock, stock, and barrel from mainland Asia starting in the 5th century.  Fewer than 4% of them are pictographs, and over 90% of the kanji are "meaning and sound borrowers."  You can read more about the <a href="https://learnjapanesebest.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-four-types-of-kanji/">four types of kanji here.</a>

                <h2>Practice Listening + Identifying</h2>
                <p>
                  「聞き取れない」（ききとれない）[kiki-torenai] is the Japanese expression for "unable to get a clear ear grab" of a sound or a term when listening.  The audible morphemes of Japanese require plenty of exposure to be able to distinguish them easily, due in part to the clunkiness of the syllabaries, the ひらがな Hiragana and カタカナ Katakana.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Japanese Complete provides a <a href="http://japanesecomplete.com/path/japanesecomplete.com/hiragana">ひらがな Hiragana listening challenge</a> for free to all; our カタカナ Katakana listening challenge is available to <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/purchase">premium subscribers</a>

                  The site <a href="https://supernative.tv/">SuperNative.tv</a> has an incredible cornucopia of film and television show clips that one can watch on replay with subtitles and fill-in-the-blank exercises to practice the ability to "ear catch" or "ear grab" the audible morphemes of Japanese.  We highly recommend this resource for new learners to get an "ear grip" of the common Japanese sounds and how they are actually pronounced.  Naturally, real-life speech and the way it is written down may not appear to match up perfectly until one has plenty of exposure.</p>

                <h2>Grammar: Particles</h2>
                <p>
                  Rather than relying on word sequence, Japanese relies on particles to partner with words in order to indicate the role of the word in the sentence.  Think of particles as dancing partners wearing brightly colored clothing who let you know the current occupation of their partner.  A subject dances with a pink-scarf wearing dancer.  A topic dances with a blue-scarf wearing dancer.  A destination of travel dances with a green-scarf wearing dancer.  When we look at the dancers, we can see clearly who they are dancing with, letting us know what the sentence means.  
              </p>
              <p>Particles are used to explain the <strong>who, what, when, where, and how</strong> of Japanese sentences and they are in <strong>post-fix position</strong>, meaning that they follow the words to which they snap.</p>
              <p>Mastery of particles is essential to having a native-level understanding of Japanese.  In fact, by exploring a frequency dictionary or the <a href="https://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/en/">Balanced Corpus of Contemporary Written Japanese,</a> one will find that <em>of the 37 most frequent words, 17 of them are particles (45%).</em></p>
                <p>
                  In Japanese Complete we teach particles using a method devised specifically for Japanese Complete and not available elsewhere: <strong>the bunsetsu jar</strong>.  Every jar (which contains a person, place, or thing) needs a lid (which contains a grammatical particle).</p>

                <h2>Kanji: Meanings</h2>
                <p>
                  Japan imported symbolic glyphs from mainland Asia and they are referred to as 漢字（かんじ） kanji — letters of the Han Dynasty and there are <a href="https://learnjapanesebest.wordpress.com/2019/12/11/the-four-types-of-kanji/">four types of kanji</a> where only 4% are simple pictographs and over 90% are "meaning-and-sound borrowers."
              </p>
              <p>In acquiring Japanese, modern learners often rely on methods inspired by <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921?pldnSite=1">Heisig's Remembering the Kanji,</a> a book written by James Heisig after he had arrived in Japan too late to take the introductory course; upon asking his friends what the hardest part of the language was, he was quickly informed that the Kanji are a most formidable adversary.  He took the spare time before the next semester started to try his best to conquer this formidable opponent, and in the process discovered that he could break the kanji down section-by-section, part-by-part, and develop clever mnemonic devices and imaginary scenes to remember their <strong>general meanings</strong> for the long-term.
              </p>
                <p>
                  Heisig only provides clear and concise mnemonics for the first hundred-or-so kanji in his series, which is quite deflating to the beginner, leaving much of the creative and mental work to the learner when they could be absorbing, rather than generating, content.  This is the reason that we have taken it upon ourselves at Japanese Complete to provide detailed mnemonic lessons for the kanji we teach.  You can see the most frequent 777 kanji on our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/777">777 kanji list.</a></p>

                <h2>Verbs: Meanings, Connotations</h2>
                <p>
                  Every Japanese sentence ends with a verb.  Our classification scheme in Japanese Complete comes from conversations with expert language teachers from University College London and Middlebury College, schools renowned for their East Asian studies and language departments.  While normal textbooks try to wedge Japanese grammar as a round peg into the square-hole shape of English, Japanese Complete strives to simplify the equation as much as possible while retaining all the fidelity and integrity of real Japanese.  Our <a href="https://japanesecomplete.com/reverse-engineer/">Reverse Engineering a Japanese Sentence</a> page details how our classification of verbs and nouns differs from common textbooks, and illustrates how they are more coherent with actual Japanese.
              </p>
              <p>In general, verbs are the missing piece of every Japanese sentence and we must wait until the end of the sentence or phrase to hear or read them.  This is what makes translation and interpretation notoriously difficult, for a translator needing a verb to connect two thoughts, nouns, or ideas, must allow the Japanese speaker to complete the phrase, adding a significant delay to the process, all-the-while needing to be able to perceive the beginning of the next phrase.  The latency effect in translating and interpreting Japanese makes this skill quite coveted in tourism, national and international diplomacy, and any role where interpretation in real-time is a must.
              </p>
                <p>
                By learning a large subset of verbs in their "plain-form" first, and then learning how to transform verbs into their variety of tenses and aspects, one builds a solid foundation for understanding written and oral Japanese.  <strong>It is wise to familiarize oneself with the great variety of tenses, active and passive constructions, and formality levels early on, so that they are not completely foreign when encountered later on in advanced studies.</strong>  In Japanese Complete, we teach politeness levels, active and passive tenses, and the variety of verbs early on so that learners have a solid foundation and are not surprised to find whole new constructions in years 3 or 4, but instead are immediately confronted with the variegated tones of the language and its inflexions.

More details at the end of the article.</p><p>I started investigating full-text search options recently. The use-case is real-time search over key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the values are either strings, numbers, or dates. It should enable full-text search over keys and values and range queries over numbers and dates with 1.5 million unique key-value pairs as the expected maximum search index size. The search company Algolia recommends an <a href="https://blog.algolia.com/algolia-v-elasticsearch-latency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end latency budget</a> of no more than 50ms, so we’ll use that as our threshold.</p><h2 id="postgresql"><a href="#postgresql" jsx="[object Object]"></a>PostgreSQL</h2><p>I’m already familiar with PostgreSQL, so let’s see if it meets these requirements.

  <p>tl;dr? <a href="#just-the-recipe">Jump right to the recipe</a></p>

<p>For reasons lost in the mists of time, Iâ€™ve been a Mac guy since 2013 - but Iâ€™ve been a command line (CLI) guy since 1990 (or earlier, hard to remember), and still am. A few years ago, I discovered <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew, aka homebrew</a> after finding out how out-of-date were so many of the standard UNIX/Linux tools included with Mac OS, e.g., bash.</p>

<p>Generalizing, the hardest part of working with the CLI on a Mac is having the same experience on all the platforms I use, which range from Windows 10 with WSL (some flavour of Ubuntu, cannot remember which), RHEL 7.6, Fedora 32, Mac OS 10.15, and Cygwin - and that problem persists across those other platforms, which is why <a href="https://github.com/PeterWhittaker/myDotFiles">I created a GitHub project to keep my dot files in snc</a>.</p>

<p>Well. Until the last few days.</p>

<p>Since last week Iâ€™ve been using the <a href="https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale">most excellent Yamale</a> to validate YAML schema Iâ€™ve defined for my <a href="https://github.com/PeterWhittaker/LinearAssuredPipeline">SELinux Linear Assured Pipeline</a>. Iâ€™ve even made some contributions to it - or, at least, am in the process of so doingâ€¦</p>

<p>â€¦and thatâ€™s where things get weird.</p>

<p>Yamale depends upon Python and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a>, the Python package manager, and upon <a href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">tox</a>, a test automation framework for Python  - but <strong>standard Mac OS has neither <code>pip</code> nor <code>tox</code></strong>. OK, so <code>brew install pip</code> and <code>brew install tox</code>, right? Well, almost.</p>

<p>This is where things can get a little weird. Yamaleâ€™s <code>tox.ini</code>, for example, depends upon two different versions of Python, <code>3.6</code> and <code>3.8</code>.</p>

<p>How does get multiple versions of Python? The short answer is <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">pyenv, a python-independent shell-script based system for managing multiple Python environments</a>. But thatâ€™s not the whole story.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/4/pyenv">page intends itself as the correct answer</a> - install <code>pyenv</code> and go! - but it is lacking a step, as I discovered - and I discovered that page <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac">from this page</a>, which tells us what we might do wrong, then what we should do to get things right - but a bootstrap problem remainsâ€¦.</p>

<p>The first page wants us to run <code>pip install pyenv</code> - but Mac OS lacks <code>pip</code>. The second page has a few brew-based recipes, but suggests that <code>brew</code> is the wrong way to go, overall, and that we really want <code>pyenv</code>. This <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/6/python-virtual-environments-mac">third page</a> tries to put things succinctly, but if youâ€™re running <code>tox</code>, there is <strong>YAS</strong> (Yet Another Step): By default, <code>tox</code> works only with your default Python environment, whether that is standard or something installed via <code>brew</code>.</p>

<p>To get <code>tox</code> to work with multiple Pythons out of the box, you need <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tox-pyenv/">tox-pyenv</a> - but <strong>that</strong> page mentions a lot of irrelevant <code>Circle CI</code> stuff.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Before we go any further, I should note that whatever you do
with brew - or with gem, if you get there - do NOT override
system defaults - Mac OS and many utilities produced for the
Mac depend upon them. Let brew manage things and install them
cellar-only. You then need to find them via appropriate
manipulation of PATH, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, etc. Cf my dot file
project for one way of doing this.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At any rate, none of those pages provide the complete answer. You know that you need</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python (and possibly multiple versions of Python)</li>
  <li><code>pip</code> (not included with Mac OS)</li>
  <li><code>tox</code>, which depends upon <code>pip</code></li>
  <li><code>pyenv</code>, which you can get a number of waysâ€¦.</li>
  <li><code>tox-pyenv</code>, which depends upon <code>pip</code>â€¦.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what is one to do? Install <code>pyenv</code> and use it to install <code>pip</code> and <code>tox</code> and <code>tox-pyenv</code> several times over? That seems soâ€¦.</p>

<p>UGH.</p>

<p>I repeat.</p>



<p>I donâ€™t know that what follows is a universally-accepted approach, but it is the shortest and cleanest path to where I needed to go (as verified by running <code>make clean; make</code> in my <code>yamale</code> top-level folder and having all <code>tox</code> tests work out-of-the-box with both Python <code>3.6</code> and <code>3.8</code>, no modifications to <code>yamale</code> files requiredâ€¦).</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/ymmv">YMMV</a> and <a href="http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/fwiw">FWIW</a>, here isâ€¦.</p>

<h3 id="just-the-recipe">Just The Recipe</h3>
<div><div><pre><code># install brew
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
# use brew to install python3, which comes with pip3
$ brew install python3          # let brew install this cask-only
# figure out your path to pip3, installed with python3
$ &lt;path to pip3&gt; install tox
# install py-env using brew
$ brew install py-env
$ &lt;path to pip3&gt; install tox-pyenv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once youâ€™ve done that, figure out what versions of Python your particular <code>tox.ini</code> specifies; for <code>yamale</code>, these are <code>3.6</code> and <code>3.8</code> which Iâ€™ve mentioned a few times alreadyâ€¦. Assuming these are what you need, the rest of your recipe is as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ brew install pyenv
$ pyenv install 3.6
# lists multiple versions, choose appropriate minor #, e.g.,
$ pyenv install 3.6.11
$ pyenv install 3.8
# lists multiple versions, choose appropriate minor #, e.g.,
$ pyenv install 3.8.5
# almost there, now we want to use what we just installed
$ cd &lt;where Yamale lives&gt;
# have pyenv set the versions of python tox should use
$ pyenv local 3.6.11 3.8.5
# that command creates a ./python-version file, which
# is already in ./gitignore! Now confirm those....
$ pyenv version
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In my case, the latter command shows</p>
<div><div><pre><code>3.6.11 (set by /Users/pww/pipelineWork/yamale/.python-version)
3.8.5 (set by /Users/pww/pipelineWork/yamale/.python-version)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>pyenv which</code> shows me what I expected:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ pyenv which python3.6
/Users/pww/.pyenv/versions/3.6.11/bin/python3.6
$ pyenv which python3.8
/Users/pww/.pyenv/versions/3.8.5/bin/python3.8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now. Run <code>make clean; make</code> and all should be well.</p>

<p>It was for me, at least.</p>

<p>Easy-peasy. Right?</p>

<p>Right.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <em>If you think of</em> <code>git branch</code> <em>as a verb meaning</em> <code>diverge from this path, split my tree</code> <em>and think of the branch name as a label that tracks the most recent commit on this new path, a lot of stuff about git becomes clearer. You might already understand what</em> <code>detached HEAD</code> <em>means</em>.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Koan1: If I am on a branch but not at a branch, I am detached.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Koan2: I can always get where I need to go, if I am committed.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>â€œAha!â€�</strong></p>

<p>Epiphanies. Eureka moments. Call them what you will, they change our world: We perceive and understand things differently. Some come after difficult, tortured paths, others from seemingly nowhere. Some dawn slowly, some disorientingly suddenly. I especially love the slow dawns, when I can feel the red pill soaking in, feel the change of perspective, feel the new world.</p>

<p>The challenge comes when you want to explain the new perspective to those who arenâ€™t there yet â€“ especially when you took the difficult, tortured path: it can be tempting to recite your journey, in the hope that others will be able to follow your footsteps.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not doomed to failure, just verbose, not to mention potentially inaccessible or irrelevant to those starting from different places: the paths of others need diverge only slightly from our own for the intersection of shared experiences to be very small indeed.</p>

<p>Besides, the one thing that you cannot explain is the experience of the red pill itself: Unless and until someone else takes it, they wonâ€™t get what that part of the trip was like. (I didnâ€™t intend the pun, but Iâ€™m happy with it :-&gt;)</p>

<p>So rather than explain how I came to git, or how I used git badly (as I now perceive it), or reference websites and tutorials and blogs and practices, all in an attempt to share pre-flash headspace, allow me one â€“ or maybe two or three â€“ noble lies.</p>

<p><strong>Lie #1</strong>: <em>You donâ€™t work</em> ON <em>a branch, you work</em> AT <em>a branch</em>.</p>

<p>Once you understand what I mean by that, you may think, as I do now, that ON Vs AT is mostly irrelevant, that ON is perhaps slightly more conceptually accurate from a code management perspective, but that AT is more useful when thinking about references in general, about what various commands do and how, and about how to solve various problems.</p>

<p><em>Aside: As soon as you understand Lie #1, you will be able to infer what a</em> detached<code>head</code><em>is and you will know that you do not need to use branches or the stash to work with them. Both (the nature of detachment, the commit-only solution) will literally just come to you.</em></p>

<p><strong>Lie #2</strong>: The only difference between a branch and a tag is persistence, or perhaps more accurately, mobility: Branches are <em>mobile</em>, tags are <em>sessile</em>. Git itself moves branches for you, and git itself keeps tags in place, unless you force it to move them.</p>

<p>This one is definitely more of a lie, but once you realize why you can pretty much use a tag anywhere you can a branch, and vice versa, youâ€™ll understand how accurate it is. At least from a perspective very much related to <strong>Lie #1</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Lie #3</strong>: We could just as well call <code>master</code> <em>fred</em> or <em>default</em> or <em>bootStrap</em> or <em>justGetStarted</em> and it would mean exactly the same thing.</p>

<p><em>bootStrap</em> and <em>justGetStarted</em> are actually pretty good names, when you consider the <em>first</em> problem that the branch concept solves. More on this below.</p>

<p>Usually at this point â€“ or far earlier â€“ most articles have brought up <code>directed graphs</code> and other matters mathematical, which I avoid herein not because I do not understand them but <strong>because they arenâ€™t strictly necessary</strong> to starting up the ladder or taking the first step on or  <em>insertFavouriteMetaphorHere</em>  and all I really hope to do is get you started.</p>

<p>Think of source code management at one its most fundamental levels: A way to checkpoint your work, easily and cleanly, so that you revert to your last known good state when something goes wrong. Start with just that.</p>

<p>The <code>git commit</code> action creates that checkpoint. Youâ€™ve probably seen in logs and man pages and blogs, etc., that each commit has a unique ID â€“ and youâ€™ve probably seen that these IDs are lengthy apparently random strings (they actually are pretty close to random, thatâ€™s one of their cryptographic properties, but that is well beyond the scope of this post).</p>

<p>Your next commit creates another checkpoint, with its own long random ID. That first commit is essentially an ancestor of the second one, since the second one built on your work in the first one. Just a bit of foreshadowing.</p>

<p>If you had to keep track of where you were, of the relationship between these commits, git would lose a lot of its value â€“ so it keeps track for you â€“ and it does this in two distinct ways.</p>

<p>The first is with the<code>HEAD</code>concept.<code>HEAD</code>is simply where you are working right now. If you only ever go forward, commit after commit after commit,<code>HEAD</code>will always refer to your last commit. You will never have to â€œsolveâ€� the â€œproblemâ€� of working on a <code>detached HEAD.</code> In fact, you will never have to know about <code>HEAD</code> or <code>HEADs...</code> but after reading this, hopefully it will just make sense to you.</p>

<p>The second way git helps you keep track of where you are is with the branch concept. Chances are you are familiar with it, but just in caseâ€¦.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say you have been working for a while, commit after commit, and are happy with your work: it works as you hoped, it is stable, it is secure, etc. Your next step is a problem you arenâ€™t sure how to solve, but you have a few ideas and want to experiment with them â€“ git helps you with branches.</p>

<p>In essence, a branch gives you a â€œplace awayâ€�, a sandbox, where you can experiment based on your good work without breaking it.</p>

<p>You create a branch for each approach â€“ <code>git branch approach01</code> or <code>git checkout -b approach01</code> or <code>git switch...</code> â€“ start coding, make some commits, compare, contrast, decide on the approach that works best. Merging that best approach and carrying on is the next step.</p>

<p>But before we take that step, letâ€™s come back to<code>HEAD</code>and to how git helps you keep track of where you are.</p>

<p>Now that you have multiple branches, you have multiple <code>HEADs:</code> There is a<code>HEAD</code>on each branch, and each branchâ€™s<code>HEAD</code>is the most recent commit on that branch. Think of a tree, coming up from the ground, tall and strong, and at some point splitting, growing two or more branches from the trunk. Each branch ends in its own <code>HEAD.</code> Itâ€™s easy to refer to the tree or to the trunk, itâ€™s the bulk of stuff that happened before you made your first branch. The branches start where things split from the trunk.</p>

<p>Which is the main part of the tree now? Well. Thatâ€™s actually a deeply philosophical question, but for most of us the answer is <code>master:</code> git knows you are likely to branch off at some point, so it simply makes sure that your work, even if perfectly linear, commit after commit without branching, has a branch name, and that name is master.</p>

<p>Whether <code>master</code> is a master in any semantic sense is entirely up to you. This is just the name that git gives the shoot that grows as you commit. Like I wrote above, it could just as easily be called <em>bootStrap</em> or <em>justGetStarted</em> or <em>myStuff</em> or <em>shoot</em>: Unless you need to come back to it, you never need to know what it was called and you only need to come back to it if you create a branch. There are git workflows based on the idea of making master â€œspecialâ€�, making it mean something (weâ€™ve just started doing this in my main job: master is our <em>generally available public release</em> branch, with other branches being for feature development, penetration testing, etc.).</p>

<p>This is <strong>Lie #3</strong>: Master is only as special as you make it, and, if you never branch, you never need it. Git just made sure it was there because chances are that you would need it, at some point. Weâ€™ll come back to <strong>Lie #3</strong>, because <strong>Lie #1</strong> also applies.</p>

<p>Getting back to our tree: if you look at the tree, and consider your solid, secure, satisfying work to be the trunk, right up to where you started branching for experimental purposes, where does master end and the branches begin?</p>

<p>Time to consider <code>branch</code> not as a <em>noun</em>, but as a <em>verb</em>. Some git commands are pretty verb-like, e.g., <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, while others are pretty noun-like, e.g., <code>git status</code>, <code>git log</code>. Until very recently, I always thought of <code>git branch</code> as a noun-like command, as in <em>make a branch</em>, but in a lot of ways, it is far better to think of it as a verb: branch to this new place. Diverge. Blaze new path.</p>

<p>You started with a shoot that grew straight and tall then got to a point where you needed to experiment, so you created a branch, to â€œwork off to the sideâ€�. Then you created another one, because you werenâ€™t sure about that path. Repeat ad infinitum, or at least ad bonum or ad satium, i.e., until you have a good enough branch.</p>

<p>Right now, youâ€™ve got <code>master</code>, which refers to the shoot, and masterâ€™s <code>HEAD,</code> which is the last commit on master, and several branches, each diverging from <code>master,</code> and each of their <code>HEADs,</code> which are the leaves, if you will, on each branch.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Well, yeah, OK, thatâ€™s how a lot of people view these branch things.</p>

<p>For the sake of this article, for the sake of pedagogy, please try this: Think of master as a human friendly, human-consumable label for the last commit you made before branching. In other words, on master,<code>HEAD</code>and <code>master</code> refer to the same commit.</p>

<p>Now do the same for each branch: Consider the branch name, e.g., <code>approach01,</code> not to apply to the entire branch, but to refer to the last, most recent commit on that branch. In other words, on any branch, including master,<code>HEAD</code>and the <em>branch name</em> refer to exactly the same thing, the most recent commit.</p>

<p>Every time you commit, git moves<code>HEAD</code>to point to the new commit. And every time you commit, git moves <em>branch name</em> to point to that same commit.</p>

<p>Why is this so important? When you checkout a branch, even master, git doesnâ€™t place you just anywhere on that branch: It places you at the end of that branch, where <em>end</em> …</p></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, Medium, Ghost. Posthaven, Svbtle, Write.as, Telegra.ph.</p>
<p>Blogging. The most elegant and natural process of idea diffusion on the web—since its infancy. Started barebones; developed massively; evolving continuously.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the next step. Lately, in my social bubble of technology and startups, I notice a revisited focus to simplicity and minimalism. It's probably part of a constant cycle, regardless, now it exists. In addition to that, there is a much wider, across the world, appreciation for controlling one's data.</p>
<p>Towards expressing this second part, it's great if a blogging platform is open source. It's also a good idea for a blogging web citizen to control their web estate: the blog domain. One can do that with a lot of blog platforms. To account for simplicity and minimalism, though, the most <a href="https://sive.rs/polut">unwasteful</a> and efficient way to run one's blog is to serve static HTML. That is, to utilise a static site generator, rather than running a backend, a database, and all that entails. It's a much simpler, more efficient, more elegant, and significantly faster way of web existence.</p>
<h2>Self hosted blogs</h2>
<p>How to empower people to create their own self-hosted blog? There are some ideas. Drew instated the <a href="https://drewdevault.com/make-a-blog">Make a blog</a> initiative. Stavros made the <a href="https://quicksite.stavros.io/">Quick Site</a> guide. My idea was <a href="https://mataroa.blog/">mataroa.blog</a>, a blogging platform that makes it easy to get off it.</p>
<p>There is a certain difficulty in starting to blog. It is inspiration that lights the fire, and inspiration is not on tap. I remember when I wanted to start a blog or write an article, I would dive into all the technicalities (re-styling, updating, refactoring, etc) and eventually not write anything.</p>
<p><a href="https://mataroa.blog/">Mataroa.blog</a> is designed for when inspiration comes. This is the time to just write, focus on the essence and get the words out. When done writing, there is lots of uninspired time to think about the best way to design, rework, speed up your blog. Mataroa enables one to do that by having export as a first-class feature. One can export into simple markdown text files, or <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> sources, or <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> sources with a single click. One can also set a redirect domain, so that their mataroa blog automatically redirects to a new blog home.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit of blogging platforms is that you can start writing immediately. No domain decisions, no servers, no coding. This comes at a cost, though: potential lock-in.</p>
<p>To account for this and the aforementioned need for simplicity, the features I'd like to see in an ideal blog platform are:</p>
<ul>
<li>absolutely no vendor lock-in</li>
<li>it even helps you get off it</li>
<li>open source</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>minimal</li>
<li>fast</li>
<li>focus on the essence</li>
<li>follow open standards such as RSS</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mataroa.blog/">Mataroa.blog</a> is designed with all these in mind.</p>
<p>But, actually, I don't want to sell mataroa to you; as much as I want to convince you on the merits of self-hosted personal blogs.</p>
<p>The foundational platform of the web—the web itself—is more democratic than any medium (wink) has ever been—at least until now.</p>
<p>Let's build directly on it without intermediate layers.</p>
<h2>Addendum on hosting</h2>
<p>During the last 10 years of massive web centralisation, there have been instances when the internet giants fall. AWS, Google, Cloudflare—bad days exist for them too.</p>
<p>It's funny to see your blog up when Google is down. Especially when the only reason is the choice of an indie cloud/server/hosting provider<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I used to depend on EC2 for servers, Netlify for CDN, Google for fonts, other CDNs for JavaScript libraries. Now, this blog loads fully from a single server with just two small requests, one HTML and one CSS file. So much fun!</p>

<p>Two new electric bin lorries have started operating in Nottingham in a world first – and they’re outperforming their diesel counterparts.</p>







<p>The sparkling new, clean and green answer to bin collections, the lorries have been doing the rounds for a few weeks and are already saving up to 70 litres of diesel and 360kg of CO2 every day. They are expected to save the taxpayer £32,000 per year in running costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the city by 52 tonnes per year – the equivalent of 2,000 trees.</p>



<p>Nottingham City Council bought the fully electric vehicles to support their aim to be carbon neutral by 2028, improve working conditions for their staff and reduce running costs.</p>



<p>The vehicles – manufactured by Original Equipment Manufacturer Dennis Eagle and supplied to Nottingham City Council by Terberg Matec UK as part of the Nottinghamshire RCV procurement contract – have replaced diesel equivalents to help empty household bins across Nottingham.</p>



<p>Cllr Sally Longford, Deputy Leader of the Council and Portfolio Holder for Energy, Environment and Democratic Services at Nottingham City Council, said: “The two electric bin lorries are the first ones off the production line – which is very exciting for Nottingham. This is recognition of Nottingham’s place as a leader in the Electric Vehicle field and putting innovative EVs into operation.</p>



<p>“These vehicles are yet another first for Nottingham, adding to our award-winning, innovative fleet of zero emission vehicles which already boasts the first fully electric sweepers, cage tippers and minibuses to be run by a local authority in the UK. We are leading by example and electrifying the refuse collection fleet is a major step forward in our aims to deliver clean air in our city and a huge step towards our carbon neutral goals.</p>



<p>“A total of 30 per cent of our vehicles are fully electric, emitting no tailpipe emissions whatsoever and these lorries further underline our commitment to having a fleet which consists of as many ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) as possible by 2028.</p>



<p>Andrew Smith, Assistant Fleet Manager, said: “In the first few weeks, we have saved around 60 to 70 litres of diesel per truck per day. That’s more than 360kg of CO2 per day we’ve not pumped into the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“They’re out at 6.30am and finishing around 1.30pm, collecting a full load then a smaller one – up to 18 tonnes in all – and coming back with 40% charge remaining. The vehicles’ power and manoeuvrability means they’re finishing around an hour earlier and are able to handle hills with full loads much better than their diesel counterparts.</p>



<p>“The team absolutely love them and don’t want to go back to the diesel.”</p>



<p>Richard Taylor, Sales and Marketing Director at Dennis Eagle said: “It’s very encouraging to work with a forward-thinking local authority like Nottingham City Council. Their ambitious plans will not only benefit people who live or work in the city but will also help drive the switch to electric vehicles across the UK.</p>



<p>“I am very proud of the eCollect and delighted that the team at Nottingham, which has genuine insight into electric vehicles, was so determined to take delivery of two of the first to roll off our production line.”</p>



<p>The vehicles are the first Dennis Eagle eCollect to be delivered to a customer and the first to be manufactured as a ‘one-stop shop build’ from a single supplier – the Terberg Rosroca Group. Nottingham City Council already has 150 zero emission vehicles. The council is making great strides toward reducing the carbon and nitrogen dioxide impacts of transport in Nottingham.</p>



<p>Details of a naming competition will be launched in the new year – watch this space!</p>

                      <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
                      We combine the efficiancy of convolutional approaches with
                      the expressivity of transformers by introducing a
                      convolutional <em>VQGAN</em>, which learns a codebook of
                      context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled
                      with an autoregressive transformer.

                <p>
  Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers
  continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks.  In
  contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local
  interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible
  for long sequences, such as high-resolution images.  We demonstrate how
  combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the
  expressivity of transformers enables
  them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images.
  We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of
  image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently
  model their composition within high-resolution images.
  Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both
  non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information,
  such as segmentations, can
  control the generated image.
  In particular, we present the first results on semantically-guided synthesis
  of megapixel images with transformers.

Figure 2. Our approach uses a convolutional VQGAN to learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is subsequently modeled with an autoregressive transformer architecture. A discrete codebook provides the interface between these architectures and a patch-based discriminator enables strong compression while retaining high perceptual quality. This method introduces the efficiency of convolutional approaches to transformer based high resolution image synthesis.

<p>This tutorial opens the series of articles about "Project JiJi" and describes how to add autofocus to the 16 mm Telephoto Lens mounted on the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera. In the past months, I've been working on a project to add autofocus to the lens and this is the result:</p><div><p><iframe width="100%" height="315" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PrbyPmq_Z7Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>Adding some background to this: The Raspberry Pi Foundation offers different Raspberry Pi Camera modules since 2013. The first module (5-megapixel) was produced in 2013, and an 8-megapixel module upgrade (v2) was released in 2016. Both models have visible light and infrared versions. This year (2020), the Foundation launched the HQ Camera. This is a 12-megapixel High Quality (thus HQ) camera (Sony IMX477), which adds the possibility to use a lens with CS-mount. It is a great upgrade, but the lens and the camera lack autofocus up to now.</p><p>If you are impatient, you can find the hardware design, firmware and software on the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus">lemariva/rPIFocus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a> repositories. But, you should come back and read the tutorial until the end, so that you can understand how it works, and if you want to, you can also cooperate on this project!</p><h2><span id="software-and-hardware-590389">Software and Hardware</span></h2><p>This section includes the software and hardware needed for this tutorial.</p><h2><span id="diy-project-jiji-590389">DIY: Project JiJi</span></h2><p>In this article, I will explain how to build the project yourself. I won't go deeper in detail. These will be covered in future articles.</p><h2><span id="hardware-pcb-ordering-soldering-and-mounting-590389">Hardware: PCB ordering, soldering, and mounting</span></h2><p>As you may have already noticed, to add autofocus to the camera, you will need to order a PCB and solder and mount some parts. In the Github repository, under the folder <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus/tree/main/pcb">`pcb</a>`, you'll find the schematic as well as the board files for the PCB. To open those files, you'll need <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.autodesk.de/products/eagle/overview">Eagle</a>. Eagle is still free for hobbyists, thus, download and install it to open the files. You can export Gerber files using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/137-how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-autodesk-eagle">this export-to-gerber tutorial</a>.</p><p>To simplify the process for you, I also added the Gerber files that you can directly send to your PCB provider. I use and recommend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://jlcpcb.com/">jlcpcb</a>. They are fast, cheap, reliable and the quality of the boards is pretty good.

So, if you're a pro, grab your solder and solder every element (ICs) for yourself, or, if your skills are basic, don't worry, grab your solder and solder the small hobbies boards that you can buy from the selection above. Two steppers rotate the focus and aperture rings. They are controlled by the M5Stack ATOM, which also measures the steppers' currents and offers an RestAPI to send the commands (see Fig. 2 for an basic PCB schematic).</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg" alt="Simple PCB schematic" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg 899w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__899.jpg 899w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/625/29e/b52/5feca3f70da50778861950__768.jpg 768w"><br><span>Fig. 2: Simple PCB schematic.</span></p></div><p>Fig. 3 to Fig. 8 show you some close photos of the design to help you to mount the elements. Fig. 3 shows you how to mount the aperture and focus belt rings. They usually have a standard of 0.8 mm pitch. So the motor pinions should be compatible with that. Fig. 4 shows the mounted motor. Check the cable color - or the order! They are connected to the A4988 drivers (Fig. 5) and that's the right connection. Otherwise, the driver won't be able to switch the electromagnets in the right sequence and the motor won't rotate. I planned a cut on the PCB so that the pinion distance to the belt ring can be modified and the motor can be fixed as shown in Fig. 6 (using a 2.5 mm screw) - not the best way, but it works ;). To fix the camera to the board, I used a 3/8 inch screw and an adapter to mount that to a tripod (see Fig. 7). The screw fixes the camera to the board. The camera tends to rotate, and it releases the screw. If that's the case, you can fix it using the two 3mm holes on the left of the camera base (see Fig. 8) with an e.g. rectangular piece of wood over the board. Finally, you need to mount the INA219 and two pinheads for the M5Stack ATOM Matrix. The INA219 measures the current of the steppers, which are used to identify the rotational limits of the focus and aperture rings. Therefore, after booting, the system calibrates itself and it doesn't require encoders to measure the steppers positions.</p><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg" alt="Focus and aperture ring belts" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/028/bde/13d/5fe90f321ecc9579624920__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 3: Focus and aperture ring belts.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg" alt="Motor connection and gear mouting" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/df5/25f/3b1/5fe90f2482bd7006993442__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 4: Motor connection and gear mouting.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg" alt="A4988 Motor stepper driver" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/4bc/2a4/32c/5fe910d944bfb013963036__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 5: A4988 Motor stepper driver.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg" alt="Motor fixing" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b09/476/b07/5fe90f2b34a72694523645__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 6: Motor fixing.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg" alt="Camera fixing / tripod adapter" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/b6f/13c/272/5fe90f3b8a223189023619__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 7: Camera fixing / tripod adapter.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg" alt="INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/0cd/6a5/977/5feb9cc4b3ea3328038215__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 8: Camera rotate fix option.</span></p><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg" alt="INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/2f2/8ca/74e/5fe90f2f2e446168683514__300.jpg 300w"><br><span>Fig. 9: INA219 and M5Stack ATOM matrix.</span></p></div><p>As you can see in Fig. 9, there are some ICs, capacitors, and resistors that aren't assembled and also two cables (red and black). The cables supply 7.5V for the motors. The ICs, capacitors, and resistors are planned to provide 5V and 3.3V to the M5Stack, A4988 drivers, and the INA219. Currently (in that Fig. 9), they are supplied via the USB cable connected, on one end, to the M5Stack, on the other, to the Raspberry Pi. So, you have two ways to supply the system :). But, yes, you need two power suppliers: one for the steppers (7.5V) and one for the Raspberry Pi (5V). The 5V on the board (via ICs) won't be able to supply the Raspberry Pi. Sorry, but I didn't want to use bigger ICs for that.</p><h2><span id="m5stack-application-590389">M5Stack Application</span></h2><p>As I described before, the M5Stack ATOM Matrix controls the motors and offers a RestAPI to receive the commands. The M5Stack application is programmed in MicroPython. If you haven't heard about MicroPython, you can check this tutorial: <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2020/03/tutorial-getting-started-micropython-v20">Getting Started with MicroPython on ESP32, M5Stack, and ESP8266</a>. MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimized to run on microcontrollers and in "constrained environments".
The application is located <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a>.</p><p>So, follow these steps to upload the application to the M5Stack:</p><ol><li>Flash MicroPython to the M5Stack as described in <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2020/03/tutorial-getting-started-micropython-v20">this tutorial</a>.</li><li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus">lemariva/uPyFocus</a> repository:
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lemariva/uPyFocus.git</code></pre></li><li>Open the folder <code>uPyFocus</code> with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> and rename the <code>config.py.sample</code> to <code>config.py</code>.</li><li>Open the file and add your Wi-Fi credentials in this section:
<pre><code>wifi = {
    'ssid':'',
    'password':''
}</code></pre>
<p>The M5Stack needs to connect to your Wi-Fi so that the Raspberry Pi (also connected to your Wi-Fi/LAN) can find it and sends the commands to control the steppers.</p></li><li>Upload the application to the M5Stack.</li></ol><p>After uploading the code, the M5Stack resets and starts with the calibration routine (check video section: nnn). Take note of the IP that the M5Stack reports while connecting to your Wi-Fi. You'll need that to configure the Microservices Application.</p><h2><span id="docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-590389">Docker and docker-compose on Raspberry Pi</span></h2><p>The application that runs on the Raspberry Pi is a microservices application. That means different services are orchestrated to offer an application. The orchestration is performed by docker-compose and the services are containerized using Docker.</p><p>To install Docker on the Raspberry Pi, just type the following on a Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker pi</code></pre>
<p>If you want to learn more about Docker on Embedded System, just read this tutorial: <a href="https://lemariva.com/blog/2018/05/tutorial-docker-on-embedded-systems-raspberry-pi-beagleboard">Tutorial: Docker on Embedded Systems (Raspberry Pi &amp; Beagleboard)</a></p><p>To orchestrate the services, you need to install <code>docker-compose</code>. This can be done by typing:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip3 -v install docker-compose</code></pre>
<p>Usually, you need to install these dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
sudo apt-get remove python-configparser</code></pre>
<h2><span id="memory-disk-optional-590389">Memory Disk (optional)</span></h2><p>To take photos faster, you can create a disk on RAM. A RAM disk offers faster access to the data compared to an SD card or a connected USB disk. Thus, this allows the application to reduce the time between photos. To do that, you need to create a folder by typing on a Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /mnt/ramdisk</code></pre>
<p>Then, you need to modify the <code>/etc/fstab</code> file and add a line at the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/fstab
### add the following line at the file's end:
tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk tmpfs nodev,nosuid,size=50M 0 0</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can mount it using:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mount -a</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that everything is working, just reboot your Raspberry Pi using:</p>
<pre><code>sudo reboot</code></pre>
<p>To display the newly created drive and check it use the following command.</p>
<pre><code>df -h</code></pre>
<h2><span id="microservices-application-590389">Microservices Application</span></h2><p>The services of the microservices application are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>webapp</strong>: it provides the frontend application (webserver). It is programmed in Angular.</li><li><strong>backend</strong>: it communicates with the frontend via a RestAPI (Flask server), controls the camera, sends the signals to the M5Stack to control the motors, sends the signals and data to the other services to identify objects and take photos. Basically, it is the core service. It is programmed in Python.</li><li><strong>obj-detector</strong>: it receives an image over UDP and identifies the object on it and returns a JSON message. It is programmed in Python. It uses TensorFlow and connects to the Coral USB Accelerator to process the data in real-time.</li><li><strong>photo-service</strong>: it receives a signal via RestAPI (Flask server) to take photos and it processes them to create HDR photos. It is programmed in Python and it uses Celery for multitasking/non-blocking response to the RestAPI.</li><li><strong>redis</strong>: Celery uses this service to schedule the tasks.</li></ul><div uk-grid=""><p><img data-src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg" alt="Webservice Microservices Application" data-srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg" srcset="https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__800.jpg 800w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__400.jpg 400w, https://lemariva.com/storage/temp/public/828/27f/a52/5fec60ad052fc228241834__768.jpg 768w"><br><span>Fig. 10: Webservice Microservices Application.</span></p></div><p>To start the Microservices application, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Download the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file or just clone the complete <a href="https://github.com/lemariva/rPIFocus">lemariva/rPIFocus</a> repository:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>

<p>2020-12-28</p>
<p>
<i>This article asks why there are so many authentication methods when the simplest one works just fine.</i>
</p>
<p>
There are several methods for password-based authentication with SMTP, POP3,
IMAP and other protocols.  The simplest one is PLAIN. It just sends user name
and password, and that's it. The server side only needs to store a hash of the
password, not the password itself, so it cannot be stolen from the server.  The
client side can store the password encrypted, so it cannot be stolen from the client
either (in msmtp and mpop: use a keyring or use gpg with <code>passwordeval</code>).
The transmission of the password is inside a TLS-secured session, so the
client knows it is really talking to the right service and not to an attacker,
and eavesdropping is prevented.
</p>
<p>
So, all problems are solved, right? But <b>why then are there so many authentication methods?</b>
I have not found a convincing answer to this question yet. In the following, I will argue that even the
relatively new SCRAM-SHA-256 method does not provide any practical benefit over PLAIN and is far more complex than it should be.
If I am wrong, please <a href="mailto:marlam@marlam.de">send me a mail</a> and correct me. I promise I will update
this article with all the convincing arguments I receive.
</p>
<p>
My premise is that everyone is using TLS for every SMTP, POP3 or IMAP session
nowadays, since there is no such thing as a trustworthy network.<br>
So what benefits does SCRAM-SHA-256 promise? According to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5802">RFC 5802</a>:
</p><ul>
<li><i>There are some significant security concerns with the transmission of clear-text
       passwords over a TLS-protected channel.</i><br>
       Are there? The RFC does not list any. Please specify.</li>
<li><i>The authentication information stored in the authentication
       database is not sufficient by itself to impersonate the client.</i><br>
       This is true also PLAIN when the server stores just hashes.<br>
       <i>The information is salted to prevent a pre-stored dictionary attack if the database is stolen.</i><br>
       Dictionary attacks do not help with good passwords. And if the user is too stupid to use a password manager for
       good unique passwords, then inventing a more complicated authentication method will not help you:
       your user will still write the password on a post-it note, stick it on a monitor, and
       then post a photo of his desk on social media. He will also without hesitation run any software from any source
       on his computer and not care about security updates or privacy settings. In other words: the user must be educated,
       you cannot solve this problem with technical means.</li>
<li><i>The server does not gain the ability to impersonate the client to other servers.</i><br>
       If you cannot trust your mail server, then it is game over anyway, so this is not a relevant concern.</li>
<li><i>Mutual authentication is supported.</i><br>
       Why would the client want the server to authenticate itself? It is already using TLS and has verified that
       it is talking to the right server.</li>
<li><i>SCRAM is capable of transporting authorization identities.</i><br>
       For what purpose? This is not needed for password-based authentication.</li>
<li><i>Support for channel binding.</i><br>
       This has absolutely no benefit when always using TLS, as far as I can see.</li>
<li><i>Support for Unicode user names and passwords.</i><br>
       PLAIN supports that too, and in a much simpler way: it sees both user name and password simply as byte sequences.
       Of course both should be valid UTF-8, but that does not need to concern the method; this is handled simply
       on the client side. No need for <code>stringprep</code> and other Unicode-interpreting mess like in SCRAM-SHA-256!</li>
</ul>
So what's left? Nothing.  I really hope I'm wrong.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<!-- End header -->
<p><a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof"><em>Futureproof</em></a> is a live editor for GPU shaders,
built on Zig, Neovim, and WebGPU.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/marble.png" alt="Marble shader"><br>
<a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtX3Ws">(original shader by S. Guillitte)</a></p>
<p>It's designed for a quick feedback loop,
recompiling shaders and marking errors live!</p>
<p>The name is tongue-in-cheek,
because it builds on as many unproven new technologies as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, which is a "better C"</li>
<li>The editor is an embedded <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>, which is a modernized Vim</li>
<li>Graphics are done with <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/">WebGPU</a>,
which is an in-development next-gen API</li>
</ul>
<p>The system also uses
<a href="https://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a> for font rasterization
and <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> for windowing,
but those are both relatively mature,
so I don't get any points for them.</p>
<h2>Embedding Neovim</h2>
<p>Neovim is run as a subprocess (<code>nvim --embed</code>),
which communicates on <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>
using the <a href="https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc"><code>msgpack-rpc</code></a> format.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/msgpack.zig"><code>msgpack</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/rpc.zig"><code>msgpack-rpc</code></a>
libraries in Zig from the ground up,
which ended up being &lt; 1 KLOC.</p>
<p>A listener thread monitors the subprocess's <code>stdout</code>,
decoding messages then passing events and responses into a pair of queues.
The main loop claims and handles events before drawing each frame.</p>
<p>RPC calls are blocking: the call is encoded and passed to the subprocess's
<code>stdin</code>, then we wait for the listener thread to return the response
on the queue.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/nvim.svg" alt="Neovim"></p>
<h2>Drawing the character grid</h2>
<p>Neovim's abstract UI model is a monospaced grid of a particular width and height.
Each cell in the grid has a character and attribute ID;
the latter is a lookup into a table of colors, bold, underlines, etc.</p>
<p>The grid and attribute table are modified through API messages
(<code>grid_line</code>, <code>grid_cursor_goto</code>, <code>hl_attr_define</code>, <code>mode_change</code>, etc),
so our UI has to keep track of this state.</p>
<p>These API calls are evaluated by the main loop
and edit state in CPU memory,
but we want rendering to be done by the GPU.
As it turns out,
both Zig and GLSL can import C headers, so Futureproof uses a fun trick:
we define a set of <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/extern/futureproof.h">C <code>structs</code></a>,
populate them on the CPU (in Zig),
then copy them to the GPU and use them directly (in GLSL).</p>
<p>(This requires a <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/GLSL/blob/master/extensions/ext/GL_EXT_scalar_block_layout.txt">GLSL extension</a>
to properly pack the <code>structs</code>)</p>
<p>We split the state into two pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta-data tables (attributes, font atlas, etc.) are in a <strong>uniform buffer</strong>,
as they're relatively small (11 KB in total)</li>
<li>The character grid is larger (1 MB), and so is passed as a <strong>storage buffer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The font is rasterized and packed into a texture on the CPU side.
As part of the meta-data, we include the positions and bounding boxes
of each character.
The font ends up looking something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/font.png" alt="Font texture"></p>
<p>The grid stores character and attribute indices packed into a <code>uint32_t</code> per cell.
This limits us to 65535 characters, but that's acceptable.</p>
<p>In this architecture, the CPU side doesn't think about vertex positions at all!
It simply passes the character grid to a vertex shader and tells it to draw
<code>total_tiles * 6</code> elements.</p>
<p>The vertex shader then calculates vertex positions,
lays out tiles in the character grid,
samples from the font texture, and so on.</p>
<p>Getting pixel-perfect font rendering was a comedy of (off-by-one) errors,
including this particularly cursed GUI:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/haunted.png" alt="Haunted Neovim GUI"></p>
<h2>Platform integration</h2>
<p>I developed Futureproof on macOS,
and there were a few cases where I needed to hook into native APIs.</p>
<p>The <code>wgpu-native</code> demo simply <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/blob/master/examples/triangle/main.c#L58-L66">writes Objective-C in <code>main.c</code></a>,
then <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/blob/master/examples/triangle/CMakeLists.txt#L16">compiles with <code>-x objective-c</code></a>,
meaning the input source file is secretly Objective-C, rather than plain C.</p>
<p>This doesn't quite work with Zig, despite my best efforts:
the pass-through C compiler doesn't accept the <code>-x</code> flag.
Instead, we can use the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Objective-C Runtime API</a> directly,
inspired by <a href="https://github.com/jimon/osx_app_in_plain_c">OS X app in Plain C</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, this is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/objc.zig">surprisingly clean</a>:
We're not defining our own classes, so we just use
<code>sel_getUid</code>, <code>objc_lookUpClass</code>, and <code>objc_msgSend</code>.
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/paste.zig#L9-L18">Here's how we use it</a>
to get a string from the pasteboard.</p>
<p>(Of course, this is fundamentally terrifying and shouldn't be used for production code)</p>
<h2>Live shader previews</h2>
<p>Futureproof attaches itself to the Neovim buffer,
so it receives messages whenever the buffer changes.
This lets us keep a mirror of the text on the Futureproof side of the RPC barrier.</p>
<p>If the text hasn't changed in some amount of time (200 ms by default),
we pass it to <code>shaderc</code> and attempt to compile it from GLSL to SPIR-V.
Errors are parsed out of the return value and passed back into Neovim,
showing up in the location list and as signs in the left column.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/error.png" alt="Error"></p>
<p>After a shader is successfully compiled, the SPIR-V bytecode is passed into WebGPU
and rendered with the rest of the GUI.</p>
<p>One unexpected challenge was keeping the GUI performant while
rendering a shader in the same GPU queue.
For challenging shaders like <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1">this seascape</a>,
the shader takes hundreds of milliseconds to render.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/futureproof/seascape.png" alt="Seascape"></p>
<p>There's got to be a <em>good</em> way to handle this,
but for Futureproof, I used a hack:
when a shader takes too long,
the preview image is split into tiles, each of which updates once per GUI frame.
The tiles are stored in a separate texture,
which is copied into the main texture once all tiles have been rendered.</p>
<p>This effectively slows down the shader by a factor of <code>n^2</code>,
where <code>n</code> is the number of tiles per side.
We pick <code>n</code> to keep the GUI responsive,
with a median filter to stop single slow frames from messing things up.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear the <em>correct</em> way to handle this with WebGPU,
but suspect that it will require support for multiple queues,
which isn't yet in the standard.</p>
<h2>Are these technologies ready for use?</h2>
<h3>Neovim</h3>
<p>Yes, it's relatively stable.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13418">one bug</a>
early in development,
which received no feedback, so that's a minor red flag.</p>
<p>More recently, I discovered a
<a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13626">more serious issue</a>
which makes it easy to deadlock Futureproof.
This more concerning,
but it may be a problem with how I architected the GUI and live error-marking system;
I'm waiting to hear back from the Neovim development team about this issue.</p>
<h3>Zig</h3>
<p>Absolutely not!
This is to be expected:
it's at 0.7.0, so it's not <em>supposed</em> to be stable or bug-free.</p>
<p>I discovered <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amkeeter">multiple bugs</a>,
and understanding the standard library requires reading the source.</p>
<p>In addition, it's changing very quickly;
updating to the latest nightly build breaks Futureproof regularly.</p>
<p>Still, Zig is <strong>fun</strong>!</p>
<p>Things that I particularly like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general-purpose allocator, which can print memory leaks on program exit.
This is like running in Valgrind all the time, and makes writing
leak-free code part of normal development.</li>
<li>C library interop is fantastic: you can natively import header files, then
call into C libraries, and it all just works!</li>
<li>The philosophy of passing explicit allocators around; particularly how arena
allocators can then be used for easy memory management.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to like <code>comptime</code> evaluation,
but it's a little too shaky right now:
I tried to use it for a
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof/blob/master/src/msgpack.zig#L119-L183">generic <code>msgpack</code> struct packer</a>,
and often ended up confused whether my code was wrong or the compiler was broken.</p>
<p>More generally, I fear that <code>comptime</code> is <em>too powerful</em>:
without some kind of concept or trait system, it can be a free-for-all.
For example, using <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Generic-Data-Structures"><code>comptime</code> type variables to do generics</a>
is <em>extremely clever</em>,
but it means that generating documentation will be a challenge:
after all, it's powerful enough to return entirely different APIs
depending on the type!</p>
<p>(Of course, this is also true for C++ templates, but they're hard enough to use that
most people don't get too weird with them)</p>
<p>Similarly, error handling is a little rough:
there's no way to attach data (e.g. a message) to an error
while using the language-level error handling.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm a little iffy on the
"strings are simply arrays of <code>u8</code>" philosophy.
Though static strings are guaranteed to be UTF-8,
the onus is on the programmer
(rather than the type system)
to enforce that strings from other sources be correctly encoded.
For a detailed look at where this can break,
see the discussion of <code>std::fs::metadata</code> in
<a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">this post</a></p>
<p>(the previous paragraph has been edited after publication,
based on feedback from the Zig Discord)</p>
<h3>WebGPU</h3>
<p>WebGPU is <em>fine</em>, but the documentation is lacking.
I had to reverse-engineer a lot of behavior from examples,
reading the source code,
and pre-existing knowledge of modern graphics APIs.
As discussed above,
the lack of multi-queue rendering was the only real frustration.</p>
<p>I was using the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native"><code>wgpu-native</code></a> bindings,
which seem a bit unloved compared to <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs"><code>wgpu-rs</code></a>.
There's <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/issues/53">one obvious bug</a>
which I encountered within 5 minutes,
and it's unclear how often it's synched with <code>wgpu-rs</code>'s releases.</p>
<p>It's frustrating needing <a href="https://github.com/google/shaderc"><code>shaderc</code></a>
to go from text to SPIR-V,
particularly because a full download unzips to 1.9GB (!!).
It looks like <a href="https://wgpu.rs/doc/naga/index.html"><code>naga</code></a>
aims to replace it, so I'm optimistic about the future!</p>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>This was a fun exercise, but I'm not planning to develop it any further.</p>
<p>(It's likely that I'll build a similar system in Rust,
next time I want a framework for semi-interactive graphics programming)</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/futureproof">on Github</a>,
and forks are welcome;
if one achieves critical momentum,
I'd be happy to link it here.</p>
<h2>Bonus Shader</h2>
<p>Here's a very bad Cornell Box Raytracer that I threw together,
basically so I could have a project thumbnail:</p>

  <p>It is well known that sound waves travel through different gases at different speeds. Perhaps the most popular demonstration of this phenomenon are the modulated voices of people who have inhaled Helium <sup id="fnref:UNSW" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:UNSW">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The goal of this post is to understand how the molecular composition of a gas determines the speed of sound waves passing through it. To make sure we are grounded in reality, we would specifically like to explain this table of the speed of sound through various gases from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics <sup id="fnref:HCP" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:HCP">2</a></sup>. These speeds are for gases at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm) and the indicated reference temperatures.</p>

<p>After staring at this table a bit a few trends emerge. First of all, the speed of sound seems to decrease as the mass of the gas increases. But clearly mass is not the only relevant factor. For example, Argon is heavier than Ethane but sound travels more quickly through Argon. The same is true for Neon and Ammonia.</p>

<p>How can we make sense of these outliers? Note that in both cases the lighter molecule nevertheless contains more atoms. For example, a molecule of Ethane has 8 atoms whereas the noble Argon has only one. So perhaps the number of atoms is what determines the speed of sound, where a greater number of atoms implies a lower speed?</p>

<p>This second hypothesis fails as well. For example, Methane has more atoms than Argon but the speed of sound through Methane is greater.</p>

<p>To make sense of these data, we will develop a simple model describing sound waves and use it to derive a formula for the speed of sound using Newtonâ€™s laws of motion and basic thermodynamics. Weâ€™ll then test our model on the table above and find that it is surprisingly accurate!</p>

<p>Based on the experimental success of our model weâ€™ll conclude that the speed of sound in an ideal gas depends on three factors: temperature, mass and heat capacity. As we will explain later in more detail, heat capacity is essentially a proxy for the number of atoms. The general idea is that molecules can absorb energy into the vibrations and rotations of their constituent atoms relative to one another. So molecules with more atoms have more opportunities to absorb heat.</p>

<p>In the next section we study what happens when a wave passes through a series of balls connected by springs. The key result will be a formula for the speed of such a wave in terms of the mass of the balls and the stiffness of the springs.</p>

<p>We will then show that a pneumatic tube filled with gas behaves quite similarly to a spring. Using the ideal gas law and the first law of thermodynamics weâ€™ll see that the â€œstiffnessâ€� of such a spring is determined by the temperature and heat capacity of the gas.</p>

<p>Finally, weâ€™ll put everything together to write down a formula for the speed of sound in a gas in terms of its mass, temperature and heat capacity and verify that it is consistent with the table.</p>


<p>Sounds waves are an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitudinal_wave"><em>compression wave</em></a>. In this section we will study a simpler model of compression waves and extend our results to sound waves later.</p>

<p>Our model consists of a series of balls connected by springs as in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/sound_waves/ball_springs.png" alt="Force"></p>

<p>The balls all have the same mass which we denote by $m$. Similarly, all of the springs have the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness">stiffness</a> $k$ and length $h$.</p>

<p>What happens if we squeeze the springs on one of the ends? Here is a simulation comparing two systems of 100 balls. The only difference between the systems is that the springs in the top one have stiffness $k=1$ whereas the bottom ones have stiffness $k=10$. Each line represents a ball and the springs have been omitted for clarity. Also, a few of the â€œballsâ€� have been colored red to make it easier to track their motion but they are physically identical to the rest of the balls.</p>

<video width="900" height="600" controls="">
    <source src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/sound_waves/spring_pair.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>The simulation starts with the ten leftmost springs compressed. These springs push back, compressing the springs to their right. Then those springs push back against their neighbors and eventually the springs on the right side become compressed. We call this propagation of compression a <em>compression wave</em>.</p>

<p>Note that when the wave in the bottom model with $k=10$ reaches the other side (i.e, when the right end is compressed), the top model with $k=1$ has only gone about $1/3$ of the way. In other words, the wave in the $k=10$ model travels about $3$ times as fast.</p>

<p>The goal for the remainder of this section will be to derive a formula for the speed of a compression wave in the ball and spring model in terms of the mass $m$, spring stiffness $k$ and spring length $h$. If the formula is any good then hopefully it will predict the speed difference we observed in the simulation.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s start by analyzing how far each ball deviates from equilibrium at time $t$. In our model, the equilibrium position for ball $i$ is $x = i \cdot h$. We define $u(x, t)$ to be equal to the amount that the ball with equilibrium position $x$ has moved by time $t$. For example, $u(4\cdot h, 10)$ records the amount that ball $4$ has moved from its equilibrium at time $t=10$.</p>

<p>To make things more concrete, here is a graph of $u(x, t)$ for the $k=10$ model in the previous simulation. To make the numbers nicer to look at, in this simulation we are measuring $x$ in terms of multiples of $h$ and $t$ is the frame index.</p>

<video width="900" height="600" controls="">
    <source src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/sound_waves/spring_u.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>As you can see, at $t=0$, $u(10, 0) = -9$ which corresponds to the fact that the $10$th ball has been pulled to the left by $9h$ meters. The balls nearby have also been shifted to a lesser degree. But $u(x, 0) = 0$ for $x \geq 20$ which means that all the balls to the right of ball $20$ start in their equilibrium position. After $30$ frames things are different. Now $u(10, 30)$ is close to zero whereas $u(90, 30)$ is around $8$ indicating that now the rightmost springs are compressed.</p>

<p>If the relationship between the springs below and the graph above is not clear, it may be helpful to focus on one of the lines highlighted in red and observe how the dot above it on the graph moves up and down as the line vibrates right and left.</p>

<p>To understand how compression waves propagate we will analyze how $u(x, t)$ evolves over time. Letâ€™s start by focusing on the ball with equilibrium position $x$:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.daniellowengrub.com/assets/sound_waves/spring_diagram.png" alt="Force"></p>

<p>How much force is exerted on the middle ball of the diagram at time $t$? First lets consider â€œSpring Aâ€�. The right end of the spring has been displaced by $u(x, t)$ and the left end has been displaced by $u(x-h, t)$. Together this means that spring A has been stretched by $u(x, t) - u(x-h, t)$. Therefore by Hookeâ€™s Law the force exerted by spring A on the ball is:
\[
F_A = -k \cdot (u(x, t) - u(x-h, t)) <br>
\]</p>

<p>Similarly, the force exerted by â€œSpring Bâ€� is:
\[
F_B = k \cdot (u(x + h, t) - u(x, t)) <br>
\]</p>

<p>There is no minus sign in this case because the force is to the right. Therefore, the total force on the ball is:
\[
F = F_A + F_B = k \cdot (u(x + h, t) - 2u(x, t) + u(x - h, t))
\]</p>

<p>Multiplying and dividing by $h^2$ we get:
\[
F = k h^2 \cdot \frac{(u(x + h, t) - 2u(x, t) + u(x - h, t))}{h^2}
\]</p>

<p>But as $h\rightarrow 0$, the fraction on the right converges to the second derivative of $u(x, t)$ with respect to $x$ so:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:force}
    F = kh^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>By Newtonâ€™s second law, the force on the ball is related to the acceleration $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}$ by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:accel}
    F = m \cdot \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>Finally, letâ€™s define a constant $c$ by:
\[
    c = \sqrt{\frac{kh^2}{m}}
\]</p>

<p>Combining equations \ref{eq:force} and \ref{eq:accel} we get the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation"><em>wave equation</em></a>:
\[
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\]</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll now show that the speed of the wave is actually equal to $c$! To see why this is so, letâ€™s try to find some functions $u(x, t)$ that satisfy the wave equation. As a warm up, here is one possible solution:
\[
    u(x, t) = \cos(x - c\cdot t)
\]</p>

<p>To verify that this is a valid solution, we calculate some derivatives</p>
<p>
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\cos(x - c\cdot t) &amp;= -c^2\cos(x - c\cdot t) \\
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\cos(x - c\cdot t)  &amp;= -\cos(x - c\cdot t) \\
\end{align*}
</p>

<p>and find that indeed
\[ 
    \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\cos(x - c\cdot t) =
     c^2 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\cos(x - c\cdot t)
\]</p>

<p>With a bit more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation#General_solution">analysis</a> one can show that <em>all</em> solutions to the wave equation are of the form:
\[
u(x, t) = f(x + ct) + g(x - ct)
\]</p>

<p>where $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary single variable functions. But notice that $g(x - ct)$ represents the function $g(x)$ shifting to the right with speed $c$ and $f(x + ct)$ is the function $f(x)$ shifting to the left with speed $c$. In conclusion, all solutions $u(x, t)$ to the wave equation propagate with speed $c$, even the complicated looking one in our simulation above.</p>

<p>To summarize, we have found that compression waves propagate through the ball and spring model with a speed of:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:c}
    c = \sqrt{\frac{kh^2}{m}}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>How well does this match our simulations at the beginning of the section? Recall that we observed that the wave in the model with $k=10$ travelled around three times faster than the wave in the $k=1$ model. On the other hand our formula predicts that if $m$ and $h$ are fixed, the speed of the wave is proportional to $\sqrt{k}$. That implies that the ratio of the speeds in our simulation should be $\frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt{1}}$ which is indeed close to three!</p>


<p>We now relate the ball and spring model to sound by replacing the springs with tubes of gas. Consider a tube which is filled with gas and sealed at the end by a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>Assholes are people with the power of willingness to do things that make them unpopular.</p>
<p>There are two types of assholes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The good ones:
<br> People who make themselves unpopular with good intentions that support the greater good</li>
<li>The evil ones:
<br> People who make themselves unpopular with selfish intentions</li>
</ol>
<p>Good assholes can be described as people having moral courage, i.e. people with the courage to take action for moral reasons despite the risk of adverse consequences. Sometimes being unpopular is what it takes to promote the greater good. It is in these scenarios that good assholes shine; they have the ability to say what needs to be said when no one else will.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene%5Fparadox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Abilene paradox</a>, for example, which describes a scenario in which “a group of people collectively decide on a course of action that is counter to the preferences of many or all of the individuals in the group”, because nobody has the courage to speak up and potentially become unpopular. A good asshole wouldn’t let this happen; he would do what he feels is right or important without caring about pissing people off. And everyone would be better off for it.</p>
<p>Evil assholes are people who help themselves to special advantages in cooperative life, without feeling bad about the negative effects on other people. These are not fun to be around. They do things like cut in line without emergency, put others down just to bring themselves up, etc.</p>

<p>We want to gain the power of willingness to become unpopular and use it for good; how do we do it?</p>
<p><a href="https://markmanson.net/being-an-asshole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Mark Manson</a> recommends three ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide what’s more important that people’s feelings</li>
<li>Build a tolerance feeling bad</li>
<li>Lean in to painful honesty</li>
</ol>
<p>For me the most applicable idea is to make a new rule for youself: “if there’s something uncomfortable that you believe is important to say, just say it. Don’t think about it. Just trust that in the long run, more times than not, you’ll be happy that you said it. In fact, chances are, in the long run, other people will be glad you said it”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

<h2>Most viewed blog posts by me</h2>

<p>I’ve been trying something new over the past couple of years. That is, I’ve been posting threads and such on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fogus">my Twitter</a> with a small handful of posts here  That said, there were a few high-traffic posts on my blog.</p>

<h2>Favorite technical books discovered (and read)</h2>

<p>I’ve intentionally reduced the number of technical books that I consume, but there are a few that I “found” in 2020 that stood out.</p>

            <h2 id="post_title">v2 Updates to my HomeKit Thermostat</h2>
        

        <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/20a3282119c79491a869757eeb6c04fc6883fcbf/41873/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/completed_desk.jpg" alt="v2 of thermostat completed, sitting on my desk"></p>

<p>The v1 post did really well, thank you guys for reading about it. I had a few more days in vacation, and wasnâ€™t quite satisfied with the v1, so I decided to make some more updates.</p>

<p>Like I said in the last post. I love talking to people about these sorts of projects. If you are building your own thermostat, or any hardware really, shoot me an email at mdl0394@gmail.com. I will also be in the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25593736">HackerNews comments section of this post</a> if you want to chat there.</p>

<p>I am considering taking the steps to make this into something that I can sell to you. If youâ€™d be interested in buying a hackable thermostat, let me know in this form <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePJdT7qP9IMAK_TZLCWFs1sodBei73pinnji0GxVe9dMl8Zg/viewform">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="where-we-were-at-v1">Where we were at v1</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.staycaffeinated.com/2020/12/27/building-my-own-homekit-thermostat-v1">My last post on this blog details the v1 thermostat</a>, but Iâ€™ll throw a brief recap in here. The v1 was a thermostat in a black box built with an ESP32 and a relay I found on amazon. The basic goal was to allow me to control my heating system from my phone, even though I couldnâ€™t buy an eecobee (or at the time I thought I couldnâ€™t at least).</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3d6c45942a18d64daa989a8b0baf0f3ab706a833/905ff/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/v1.jpg" alt="v1 of thermostat on my wall"></p>



<h2 id="plans-for-v2">Plans for v2</h2>

<p>My main goal for v2 is to turn this into something I feel comfortable using every day. To get there I wanted to accomplish these tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New Adafruit temperature sensor (MCP9808)</li>
  <li>Small OLED display that shows status</li>
  <li>Buttons for standard control (incase you donâ€™t have your phone around)</li>
  <li>Put most of the components on a nicer project board, so I donâ€™t have to have 6 WAGOs shoved in the case this time</li>
  <li>A couple suggestions from the hackernews comments on the last post:
    <ul>
      <li>5 minute minimum runtime so I donâ€™t upset my poor olâ€™furnace</li>
      <li>Use a running average (rather than just the last temp read) to protect from a finicky temp sensor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="testing-out-the-new-stuff">Testing out the new stuff</h2>

<p>A few new components in this build, so naturally the first thing to do was to test them all out.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f51a625c3d1e7d4a8942d52eb6ddf6a79f27ac2c/f377d/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/breadboard.jpg" alt="New components on a breadboard working"></p>

<p>I intentionally bought an I2C display to make it easier to wire things together. The thermometer is i2c as well, so this reduces the number of wires that need to go from ESP â†’ Project Board.</p>

<p>Thanks to the hilariously easy to use adafruit libraries both the thermometer and display were working in a matter of minutes. (<a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306.git?utm_source=platformio&amp;utm_medium=piohome">Adafruit SSD1306</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MCP9808_Library?utm_source=platformio&amp;utm_medium=piohome">Adafruit MCP9808</a>). I would throw in some code for how I am controlling these devices, but itâ€™s literally just the example projects with some stuff deleted out of the middle.</p>



<h2 id="binding-it-all-together">Binding it all together</h2>

<p>v2 is intended to be used for quite a while, so I wanted things secured pretty well on a project board, rather than having a nest (heh) of wires shoved into a box.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/96c6ad60666089e6f56cc6308213b719216ebb32/cd1c0/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/project_board_1.jpg" alt="Project board with basic layout">

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6033e23fdc4ff303d3007362c23c50eb1b73ce79/e0207/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/project_board_3.jpg" alt="Project board back with no pull down resistors">
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7c672c586558cf5cccd281696fe1cb64fa2519eb/57dd1/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/project_board_4.jpg" alt="Completed project board"></p>

<p>Basically went down without a hitch. I did forget to include pull down resistors for my button originally, but you can barely even tell they were added as an afterthought in the finished product (the yellow heatshrinked 10k resistors).</p>

<p>I am pretty satisfied with how the project board came out. Things lined up pretty well naturally, and I had enough space to include a debug header on the back for all of the connections to the ESP32. I plan to continue to make changes to this project, so I am trying to avoid more permanent soldering jobs to the ESP32, to save myself some de-soldering time down the line.</p>



<h2 id="case-updates">Case Updates</h2>

<p>With the new components and display, the case needed to be expanded to comfortably fit everything in. After some quick modeling and an afternoon of 3d printing, the new case was born.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/695f90cfc0ad8dc178e86970ba5d53fe2d1c94a7/46a36/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/modeling_computer.jpg" alt="Me modeling this in fusion 360"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e031fe80a9d0137d4db582f1ff63acada03de940/03cfc/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/3d_printer.jpg" alt="3d printer printing the front">
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/70912e7dded8f03483f32112ab8ece415a5f997e/6279b/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/modeling_desk.jpg" alt="Image of the printed case on my desk"></p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fca3ac451f1ab1ea4cbd11b40c8d7e2e6019b42f/83c80/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/model_test.jpg" alt="Image of the front of the case test"></p>



<h2 id="code-updates">Code Updates</h2>

<p>One of the new requirements for the v2 was that the heater will stay on for a minimum of 5 minutes, no exceptions, even if you manually turn it off it will still stay on for 5 minutes. In order to support this new mode, I have added the concept of â€œWaitingâ€� to the state machine. Now instead of going to an off state, if it has been &lt;5 minutes since the thermostat was turned on, the thermostat will go into waiting instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e4a3ad59982e1e6540fe338866ce2e92e66b3fd8/09885/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/state_machine_v2.png" alt="v2 state machine"></p>

<p>Some have argued that using a state machine for this problem is overcomplicating the issue. Thatâ€™s pretty valid, this state machine is fairly complex, but I really like that the state machine makes it really easy to code and understand both the current state of the thermostat and the transitions of the thermostat. As I continue to complicate the main control logic (example: adding a cooling mode or adding different stages of heating) it will only get more complicated, so I prioritized a more scalable solution over a simple solution.</p>

<p>Other than that the rest of the updates were pretty straight forward. The Adafruit display library made it as easy as printf to draw the current status onto the display, so thereâ€™s nothing really to phone home about there. And the buttons just fire actions that were already implemented for the homekit control system.</p>



<h2 id="final-installation">Final Installation</h2>

<p>The only thing left to do was install it. I am honestly a bit disappointed that the LED shines through the plastic, but at least that makes it easy to see the current state of the relay. Itâ€™s now almost the same size as old thermostat, in future revisions the relay will shrink to a much smaller switching relay, so hopefully the size will shrink closer to that of an eecobee or nest.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6def86b036b4971400b6ba6dd98733bef49a34c0/8c55c/images/homekit_thermostat_v2/completed_wall.jpg" alt="Completed thermostat on my wall"></p>



<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>

<p>I am pretty strongly considering turning this thing into something people can buy. If youâ€™d be interested in buying an open sourced hackable home thermostat, let me know in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePJdT7qP9IMAK_TZLCWFs1sodBei73pinnji0GxVe9dMl8Zg/viewform">form</a> (or reach out to my email directly).</p>

<p>v3 improvements already planned:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A much smaller â€œmini switching relayâ€� to control the heater, the current one is way way overkill, and takes up 1/3 of the space in the case</li>
  <li>A custom PCB. I want to at least give my Mom one, so I am going to make a custom PCB and get it printed on DirtyPCBs so I donâ€™t have to spend 3 hours soldering together another one</li>
  <li>HomeAssistant integration. I already have a few different ways I want to hook it up with my other smart home devices, so I am going to prioritize haas integration asap</li>
</ul>

<p>Interviewers tend to hire candidates that think like themselves,
choosing <b>conformity</b> rather than skills, experience or clear thinking.</p>

<p>Once I was interviewed by one of the PHP PDO developers,
a popular database abstraction layer.  He asked my opinion of the PDO,
I told him honestly where I thought it failed.  Most companies would have
turned me down on the spot.  This interviewer
offered me a job.  When I asked him why, he said, <b>"I wasn't interested
in whether you liked my project.  I wanted to know if you could
think rationally and express yourself."</b></p>

<p>These days, I am often asked about software
design patterns. Have I read "Design Patterns?"  Can I name three design
patterns?  When I tell them, "There's no such thing as design patterns"
and explain why, I am turned down for other candidates.</p>

<p>So what's the story of design pattern theory?  Where does
it come from?  And why has it been discredited as modern-day alchemy?</p>

<h3>&nbsp;The Story of Design Patterns</h3>

<p>In computing, <b>"design pattern"</b> (a redundant term...aren't
all patterns designs?) has many meanings.
The term comes from the construction industry, where it
refers to any proposed design for buildings, towns, floor plans and so forth
(<a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/design/samples/slide001.html">"'Design Patterns' Aren't"</a>, M. J. Dominus).
  In 1994, the book
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">"Design Patterns"</a>
by Gamma, Helm, Johnson and Vlissides (sometimes called "The Gang of Four")
took the idea
differently.  While code reuse is as old as the subroutine (1950's),
this book suggested there were <b>common solutions used by
developers over and over, across different industries, programming
languages and types of software</b>.  These would be at a higher level
than a function call, using standard combinations of features to solve common
problems.  They proposed <b>23 such patterns</b>.  With enough
patterns, programming could be boiled down to a simple process:
identify the category of problem, and fill-in-the-blank with the standard
solution.</p>

<p>To give a simple example, a function returns a value in a certain format,
standard or units, but the programmer desires a different one.  So the
programmer makes a conversion function, which calls the first function and
then converts the value and returns it in a new format.  A function
may give a result in Australian dollars, but the programmer creates a wrapper
function to call the function and then convert to American dollars.
This a <b>"Decorator pattern"</b> or "Adaptor pattern".</p>

<p>Design pattern theory rose to prominence in 2005.
The <b>Association of Computing
Machinery</b> (ACM), a political-academic organization, praised the author's
work.  Now universities  began teaching design patterns in
their curriculum.  The education language Python began including
design pattern features. Adding to the confusion, the book "Learning Java"
by Niemeyer and Knudsen appeared at the same time, using the
term  "design pattern" incorrectly for coding-by-convension (KB: 17/12/30).
<b>By 2010, many students brought up in design pattern
theory began entering the workforce</b>.  In recent years, questions on design
patterns, asked by these developers, have begun appearing in job interviews.</p>

<p>Enthusiasts say design patterns improve
readability, flexibility and ease of making changes, reduce errors and risk.

<h3>&nbsp;The Bad Science Behind Design Pattern Theory</h3>

<p>The design pattern benefits are the "usual suspects", a laundry
list of things that every software fad claims.  While they could be real, what
if they are not?  Is there any proof that design patterns exist and that they
work?</p>

<p>In recent years, after schools began teaching
design patterns as accepted practice, Durham University researched this very question.
Could they find proof for design patterns?  They surveyed hundreds of
research papers and researchers, and revealed that <b>80% of the patterns
proposed
in the 1994 book do not meet the requirements of a design pattern</b>.
That is, these patterns are not commonly used techniques, not used through
software development, not even by people trained in designed
patterns (<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/design-patterns-magic-or-myth">"Design Patterns: Magic or Myth?"</a>, InfoQ).  They don't exist.</p>

<p>How is it possible that the 1994 book speaks of common
solutions while researchers cannot find them?</p>

<p><b>When it comes to patterns, 
people can see them where none exist</b>.  Psychologists call this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">"Apophenia"</a>.
People see patterns and hidden meanings in gambling, fortune-telling, putting
modern ideas into ancient texts
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisegesis">"eisegesis</a>"), seeing
their own ideas in random data (called "overfitting") or drawing conclusions
without solid evidence (confirmation bias).</p>

<p>The Gang of Four had committed a big taboo in research:
<b>confirmation bias</b>.  Determined to find patterns in random software, they
fooled themselves, found their own bogeymen and exaggerated their findings.
The 1994 book, taught in universities, praised by the ACM, proved to be
empty
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil">snake oil</a>.</p>

<h3>Related Criticisms of Design Pattern Theory</h3>

<p>People raise other objections to Design Patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Design Patterns are Kludges</b>

<p>In "Design Patterns in Dynamic Languages", Peter Norvig points
out that <b>over half of the design patterns in 1994 book are workarounds for
missing language features</b>.</p>

<p>Consider the singleton, a single use object that is only
created once.  This is used to create a libraries with a single namespace.
If the language had decent library features, there would be no reason to
use singleton classes.  If you need a lot of singletons, maybe you're
using the wrong programming language or not recognizing that your
language is "fundamentally broken"
(<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rethinking-design-patterns">"Rethinking Design Patterns"</a>,
<a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/design/samples/slide001.html">"'Design Patterns' Aren't"</a>,
M. J. Dominus).</p>

</li><li><b>Design Patterns are Lazy Design</b>

<p>Contemporary programmers often copy-and-paste code without considering the
implication (<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rethinking-design-patterns">"Rethinking Design Patterns"</a>),
sometimes blamed on Java's emphasis on downloading objects
(<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/rethinking-design-patterns">"Rethinking Design Patterns"</a>).

</p><p>In "Revenge of the Nerds" (2002), Paul Graham goes further, suggesting that
patterns are a form of laziness, where the programmers are not focused
on the problems and creating an appropriate design.  Most problems are
unique and complex while design patterns are simple and reusable.  People
are implementing the patterns because they think they should, not creating a
pattern appropriate to solving the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Comparing software development to civil engineering, for example, doesn't make
sense.  As agile has taught us, software projects are affected by complexity and
change in ways that other industries are not affected.</p>

</li><li><b>Design Patterns Increase Complexity</b>

<p>Using inappropriate patterns can be like trying to force
a square peg into a round hole: adding additional work and unnecessary
dependencies.</p>

<p>Are things overly abstracted?  Factory classes, for example, might be complicated overkill, making things
worse not easier (<a href="http://www.realfreemarket.org/blog/2012/06/21/design-patterns-suck/">Design Patterns Suck</a>).</p>

</li><li><b>Common Designs may be Bad Designs</b>

<p>Just because something is commonly used doesn't make it a good idea.
It could be bad, or even outdated.
Singletons, for example, are sometimes seen as trying to avoid object-orient
design
(<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/design-patterns-magic-or-myth">"Design Patterns: Magic or Myth?"</a>),  increasing dependencies and making testing more difficult (<a href="https://puredanger.github.io/tech.puredanger.com/2007/07/03/pattern-hate-singleton/">Patterns I Hate #1: Singleton</a>, <a href="http://coderoncode.com/design-patterns/programming/php/development/2014/01/27/design-patterns-php-singletons.html">Design Patterns in PHP: Singletons"</a>).</p>

</li><li><b>More Abstraction Doesn't Necessarily Mean Better Communication</b>

<p>An abstraction doesn't always simplify a problem.  Excessive abstraction can muddy
the waters on otherwise simple problems.
Rather than reusing proven solutions, patterns add layers of complexity and
requirements that are not suited to the problem the developer is trying to
solve.</p>

<p>Layer upon layer of formal definitions do not necessarily
make a project easier to understand, any more than excessive
documentation.</p>

</li><li><b>Design Patterns are not Clearly Separate from Implementation</b>

<p>Patterns should be a level above implementation, not dealing with
language features.  Some of this confusion comes from the "Learning Java" book
(KB: 17/12/3).</p>

<p>For example, in
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074195/swing-gui-programming/strategy-for-success.html">"Strategy for success"</a>, where David Geary defends design patterns, he advises Java developers to use Java language features correctly (that is, implementation).
A similar case is made in <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/reap-the-benefits-of-design-patterns-in-software-development/">"Reap the benefits of design patterns in software development"</a>, where design patterns are described as a good use of objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Advocates of Design Patterns</h3>

<p>Despite the evidence that Design patterns do not exist,
the theory still has its supporters.  Here are some of their reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Ignorance</b>

<p>People criticize new ideas
(<a href="http://www.developer.com/design/article.php/1474561/What-Are-Design-Patterns-and-Do-I-Need-Them.htm">"What Are Design Patterns and Do I Need Them?"</a>).
The technical jargon is not understood by critics (Last citation,
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190165.aspx">"Using Patterns to Define a Software Solution"</a>).</p>

</li><li><b>Unfounded Belief that Design Patterns are Slow</b>

<p>Design patterns are seen as unnecessary design work that
takes time away from
development (<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/tips/808058/reasons-for-using-design-patterns">"Reasons for using design patterns"</a>).</p>

</li><li><b>Bad Use by Noobs</b>
<p>Novice developers overuse or misuse them.
They use them because they believe they should, as they were taught in university,
using too many or the wrong patterns, producing excessive or inefficient designs
(<a href="https://crazyagility.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/myth-1-design-patterns-are-bad-or-useless/">"Myth 1: Design Patterns are Bad or Useless"</a>,
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074671/core-java/design-patterns--mogwai-or-gremlins-.html">"Design Patterns: Mogwai or Gremlins?"</a>).</p>

</li><li><b>Jealosy</b>
<p>Programmers who disagree with design pattern theory are people without
design or architecture skills
(<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb190165.aspx">"Using Patterns to Define a Software Solution"</a>).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>The popularity of the 1994 book was driven by this
alchemical quest to find software gold, and promoted by politics and peer
pressure.
However, the research is starting to come in: the theory is faulty and
is not supported by evidence.</p>

December 31, 2020 | https://unmdplyr-new.bearblog.dev/a-case-against-text-protocols/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unmdplyr-new.bearblog.dev/a-case-against-text-protocols/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>Human-computer interaction is very different from computer-computer interaction. For a human to communicate with a computer, English-like commands on text shell or graphical user interfaces that uses point-and-click model works great. But once that ends and when two or more computers have to interact, text protocols may not be all that helpful. Yet, text based computer-to-computer protocols are extremely common and often seemingly ubiquitous even in places where it's impossible for an average human to interact.</p>
<p>Here are some shaky arguments you'll come across on the internet that glorifies text based protocols.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simpler to use text</li>
<li>You can type out messages</li>
<li>It's easy to debug</li>
<li>Parsing</li>
<li>Extensibility</li>
<li>Error recovery</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="argument-simpler-to-use-text">Argument: Simpler to use text</h3>
<p>...or any variations of it.</p>
<p>To be clear, historically computers had different bit widths ranging anywhere from 1 to 48 bits per byte between vendors and models. Even text itself was encoded differently on different computers from BCD, IBM, ISO, and 100s more. If you have any latest Linux or BSD computer, type <code>iconv -l</code> to list some popular text encoding formats. ASCII and UTF-8/16/32 eventually fixed the encoding problems only recently in late 80s and early 90s. Text was never as portable as it's believed to be.</p>
<p>It was only somewhere in early 90s did <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/7229.html">ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993</a> came up suggesting power of 2 for measuring data widths -- fixing byte as 8 bits. And now nearly almost all CPUs in use today represent numbers in two's complement making binary messages a simpler alternative over text formats.</p>
<h3 id="argument-you-can-type-out-messages">Argument: You can type out messages</h3>
<p>Surely, it's not like you will open a terminal on your cell-phone and then type in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261">SIP</a> like this to call your friend.</p>
<pre><code>INVITE sip:1001@10.0.0.1:2780;transport=udp SIP/2.0

<p>People don't even dial an actual number any more these days. It's usually a name searched in contacts followed by the "Dial" button. Any argument around this usually derives from the idea that it's as easy as opening a socket and typing out a command. It maybe true with FTP or <code>telnet</code>, but not so much with HTTP or any modern day text based protocols.</p>
<h3 id="argument-parsing-easy-to-debug">Argument: Parsing/Easy to debug</h3>
<p>...or any variations of it.</p>
<p>Without a visualiser (even a <a href="https://wiki.wireshark.org/VoIP_calls">rudimentary one</a>), the above message and the subsequent control-plane communication is not easy to debug. Sure you can view this on a terminal or edit this in your favourite text editor, but what next? How are you going to feed this into the call controller machinery without extensive debug openings into the state machine library?</p>
<p>As for parsing, take NTP for example,</p>
<pre><code>struct ntp_ts {
    uint32_t secs;
    uint32_t frac;
};

struct ntp_packet {
    unsigned int li: 2;       /* Leap Indicator */
    unsigned int vn: 3;       /* Version number of the protocol */
    unsigned int mode: 3;     /* Client or server */

    uint8_t stratum;          /* Stratum level of the local clock */
    uint8_t poll;             /* Maximum interval between successive messages */
    uint8_t precision;        /* Precision of the local clock */

    uint32_t root_delay;      /* Total round trip delay time */
    uint32_t root_dispersion; /* Maximum error allowed from primary clock source */
    uint32_t ref_id;          /* Reference clock identifier */

    struct ntp_ts ref_ts;     /* Reference time-stamp */
    struct ntp_ts org_ts;     /* Originate time-stamp */
    struct ntp_ts rx_ts;      /* Received time-stamp seconds */
    struct ntp_ts tx_ts;      /* Important field for client: Transmit time-stamp */
} __attribute__((packed));
</code></pre>
<p>It is as simple as dumping <code>struct ntp_packet</code> on wire and reading it off it -- no parsing involved except for calling <code>ntohX()</code>/<code>htonX()</code> on all fields except <code>li</code>, <code>vn</code> and <code>mode</code>.</p>
<p>Do you think JSON/XML would look nicer? If a parser was to be written that parsed NTP over JSON using DOM or Stream parser, it won't be apparent what is being parsed by just looking at the source code. Now of course you can add a few extra layers on top where there is some kind of style sheet or meta XML that is parsed during build that gives you a <code>class NTPPacket</code> with several <code>get</code>/<code>set</code> functions and also a cute looking serializer function or perhaps a class too. Parsing now is no more a <em>O(1)</em> problem but a complex <em>O(wtf)</em> problem with equally complex memory usage. But because that equation can somehow be expressed in terms of <code>n</code>, people will have cartoonish light bulb moment, concluding that the said parsing algorithm is <em>linearly scalable</em>. Since hardware is also cheap, it's easier to add more hardware to handle more messages, so it's a matter of client side economics and that there's nothing to worry about code-readability and long term maintainability. Any attempt to use <code>struct</code> again will be branded backward thinking or a futile attempt at premature optimisation.</p>
<h3 id="argument-extensibility">Argument: Extensibility</h3>
<p>When people talk about extensibility, they often expect adding or removing fields at will. Probably, they've never heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value">Tag-Length-Value</a> technique or the modern day <a href="https://cbor.io/">CBOR</a>. I mean sure, you can add a new <code>Content-Type: application/batmobile</code> but if the other end doesn't recognise the value or even the entire field, it isn't so much useful anyway.</p>
<h3 id="error-recovery-and-resilience">Error recovery and resilience</h3>
<p>How many HTTP/XML/JSON parsers out there recover from failed tokens and read the remaining contents? And how useful will that data be overall? Most popular parsers usually fail on the first error and report it. Protocols built on this usually send an error message back. So there's not much of error recovery either. Arguments around this usually suggests that somehow text protocols are resilient to 1 off errors and that the message as a whole is not corrupted. This argument is actually true for <code>syslog</code> vs <code>journalctl</code> but not so much in communication protocols.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is not to say text protocols are wrong; they have a place. They are very useful in programming languages that cannot offset into a memory chunk directly without using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/Buffer.html">unholy</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/struct.html">bloated</a> APIs. But using them in telecommunication systems which is predominantly machine-to-machine is just an overkill. Hardware is getting cheaper by the day and adding more memory and more CPUs to do a task will be economical. Nevertheless, binary protocols are both space and time efficient. They have less overhead in parsing/building and are slightly easier to maintain.</p>

<h3>Hiding messages in chess games</h3>
<p><i>Tue  9 October 2018</i></p>
<p><i>Tagged: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/chess.html">chess</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/steganography.html">steganography</a>, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/software.html">software</a></i></p>
<p>I designed a steganography system that encodes data as a chess game.
A convenient way to communicate chess games is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">PGN</a>,
but any means of communicating the moves of the game would work, as the information is encoded conceptually in the
moves themselves, rather than taking advantage of any redundancy in the PGN format.</p>
<p>You can play with it here: <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg/">Chess Steganography</a>.</p>
<p>The code is <a href="https://github.com/jes/chess-steg">on github</a>. There is also a perl implementation of the same concept, but the encoding is incompatible because it was easier that way.</p>
<p>As an example, the text "Hello, world!" becomes:</p>
<blockquote>1. e3 b6 2. b3 Bb7 3. Nf3 Bxf3 4. Bd3 e6 5. h4 g6 6. b4 h5 7. gxf3 c5 8. Bb2 a5 9. Rh3 e5 10. c4 Bh6 11. Be2 Ke7 { White resigns. } 0-1</blockquote>
<p>You can look at this game <a href="https://lichess.org/Jo8s60AO">on lichess</a>, and copying and pasting the full PGN from lichess into the "Unsteg" box (despite lichess's annotations!) will allow you to retrieve the message.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>First we encode the input data bytes as a bignum so that it's easier to work with. I prepended an imaginary "0x01" byte to the input
so that leading "0x00" bytes are not lost ("0x00 0x03" and "0x00 0x00 0x03" both become just "3" as a bignum; with a "0x01" at the start
they can be distinguished from a plain "0x03").</p>
<p>At a given turn, we generate the list of all legal moves. Discard any moves that would end the game (as that
might leave us unable to encode all of the data) and sort the moves so that we know we have a canonical ordering. For the first move, there
are exactly 20 legal moves.</p>
<p>If every turn had exactly 20 legal moves, we could easily encode the data in the chess game by encoding it as a base-20 number and then
choosing the move, for each digit, that corresponds to that digit.</p>
<p>The fun trick here is that the same scheme works even if the number of legal moves per turn is not constant! To remove the least-significant-digit
in base 20, we just take our bignum modulo 20, and then divide the bignum by 20 (truncating a fractional part, instead of rounding) before processing the next digit. This works just as well even if the base
is not constant. So for each turn of the game, we get to encode some amount of data based on how many legal moves were available. Each move is a "digit"
of the number in a variable-base numbering system, where the "base" at any given digit is dictated by how many legal moves there were.</p>
<p>So now we just loop until our bignum is zero, generating the list of legal moves at each turn, and consuming some of the bignum by encoding it
into a chess move. Having consumed the bignum, we can just pretend that the player who is supposed to move next resigned instead of playing a move,
and we have a complete chess game.</p>
<p>About 1 byte per move (or 4 bits per ply) is typical for short messages (which is about what you'd expect if you assume around 16 possible
moves per turn). For longer messages this gets worse, as the endgame tends towards having just the two
kings remaining on the board, where fewer possible moves are available.</p>
<h3>Worked example</h3>
<p>Let's try to encode the letters "JS".</p>
<p>As bytes, we have "0x4a 0x53". Since my implementation was little-endian by accident, we get "0x01 0x53 0x4a" after prepending the 0x01 byte. 0x53 = 83 and 0x4a = 74. This
corresponds to the number 86858 (1*256*256 + 83*256 + 74).</p>
<p>White's first turn of the game has 20 possible moves (sorted lexically):
  Na3, Nc3, Nf3, Nh3, a3, a4, b3, b4, c3, c4, d3, d4, e3, e4, f3, f4, g3, g4, h3, h4.</p>
<p>So we need to get the least-significant-digit of the base-20 representation of our bignum, which is 86858 % 20 = 18. The move with index 18 (starting from 0) is <b>h3</b>.
So white plays the move h3, and we divide our bignum by 20: 86858 becomes 4342.</p>
<p>Black's first turn of the game also has 20 possible moves. Black needs to play the move at index 4342 % 20 = 2. This move is <b>Nf6</b>. So black plays Nf6, and then
we divide our bignum by 20 again: 4342 becomes 217.</p>
<p>White's second turn has only 19 legal moves now, so now we need the least-significant-digit of the base 19 representation of what remains of our bignum.
Not a problem. 217 % 19 = 8, move 8 is <b>c3</b>. White plays c3, and we divide our bignum by 19 this time: 217 becomes
11.</p>
<p>Black's second turn has 22 legal moves. 11 % 22 = 11, move 11 is <b>b6</b>. Black plays b6 and we divide our bignum by 22: 11 becomes 0. Game over. It's white to
move, so white graciously resigns, and we have finished encoding the number 86858, which encodes our letters "JS":</p>
<blockquote>1. h3 Nf6 2. c3 b6 { White resigns. } 0-1</blockquote>
<p>It should be clear that the same scheme works for longer messages, and in practice I have found it works for messages that appear <i>way</i> too large, although a 600-move
chess game is obviously suspicious.</p>
<p>Decoding the message is the same process, but in reverse: instead of generating the bignum and then consuming it with chess moves, we build up the bignum from the chess moves
and then decode it into the raw bytes.</p>
<h3>Potential improvements</h3>
<p>My current implementation avoids checkmating, and ignores draw by repetition and the 50-move rule, but doesn't notice a stalemate. This is because detecting stalemate in <a href="https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/">chess.js</a> is a bit more annoying without simulating every possible
move at every turn, which makes it quite slow. The downside of this is that there is likely some set of data that cannot be encoded at all because it leaves
the game in a stalemated state, where there are no legal moves. Even if this were fixed, it is possible that the game could get into a state where there are legal moves,
but all of them are either checkmate or stalemate. After checkmate and stalemate moves are rejected, there would be no available moves to select from. In practice I've
not run into any of these conditions so far, avoiding checkmate seems to be good enough.</p>
<p>Also, the moves played in the games are quite likely to be complete blunders, as the algorithm has no idea what makes a reasonable or unreasonable move. It simply plays
moves based on whatever move encodes the data. You could encode data using quite-convincing moves if, instead of allowing selection from all ~20 moves per turn,
you limited it to only the moves that a chess engine doesn't consider to be blunders. This would make the games more convincing, at the cost of making them longer.
And you'd also need to come up with a reason that the engine plays good moves, but seems to miss every available checkmate.</p>
<p>The system as implemented involves a contrived game where both players' moves are chosen freely, but it could be extended to encode a message even when playing against
a player who is not complicit. It would work almost the same, but moves would need to be chosen on-the-fly because our list of legal moves depends
on what our opponent played. Once we've consumed our entire bignum, we simply resign.
This "one-sided" mode does have the problem that the other player might checkmate us before we've got our message across, however. A practical way to use it might be to have 
the sender set up a lichess account which the recipient knows about. Whenever the sender wants to send a message, he plays a game against anybody else on lichess,
encoding his message in the moves he chooses. (In the event that he gets checkmated before finishing the message, he just plays another game and tries again). The recipient
periodically checks this lichess account for new games (specifically, ones in which the sender resigned rather than getting checkmated), and decodes the moves
to retrieve the message.

<p>In his bestselling book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens">Sapiens</a>, Yuval Harari argues that humans became the dominating species of planet earth because we are the only animal that can cooperate in large numbers. This, he claims, is due to humans’ ability to believe in purely imaginative things and concepts. A company like Google, for example, doesn’t <em>really</em> exist. Sure, there’s the Google.com website and physical Google offices with real Google employees – but the idea of Google as a company is just a fictional concept. It only exists because multiple people believe in it. The same is true for legal systems, nations, religion or money. Every large human cooperation system is based on a fictional idea that only lives in our collective minds.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/qanon.gif" media="min-width: 600px">What Harari doesn’t discuss in his book is the extreme other end of this cognitive ability: Conspiracy theories. I’ve been fascinated by <a href="https://reallifemag.com/this-is-not-a-game/">Jon Glover’s recent essay on QAnon</a>, in which he compares conspiracy theorizing to alternate-reality games. Participating in QAnon conspiracies, he says, feels like playing a real-life multiplayer game based on secret insider knowledge.</p>



<p>Social media has made conspiracy theorizing so addictive and immersive that the line between story and reality can become incredibly blurry. </p>



<p><i>“A lot of these groups are like cults […] They have beliefs that border on religiosity … And when you contradict them, it’s like telling them Jesus isn’t real.”</i></p>



<p>The religion analogy is interesting because it’s a perfect example of why fact checking as a countermeasure is useless. <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/about">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/programs/third-party-fact-checking">Facebook</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-factcheck/with-fact-checks-twitter-takes-on-a-new-kind-of-task-idUSKBN2360U0?il=0">co</a> have all introduced fact checks and fake news labels to combat conspiracy theories. It’s naive to think that they will work.</p>



<p>Think about it: Science (which, you could argue, is also a form of fact checking) has been around for centuries trying to debunk most religious beliefs – and yet religion still plays a major role in Western society. If entire education systems teaching millions of people about science haven’t worked, why do you think adding a small fact check disclaimer below a YouTube video would?</p>



<p>In fact – as you would expect from a perfect alternate-reality game – fact checks (and how to circumvent them) have <a href="https://twitter.com/elisethoma5/status/1303630697567928320">actually long been part of the game</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that science is also just another belief system. We laugh about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">flat earthers</a>, but how many people can actually explain why the world is round in a scientifically correct way? Most of us don’t <em>know</em> science, we <em>believe</em> in science.</p>



<center><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/reality.gif"></center>



<p>What should give us hope though is the fact that many people believe in *both* science and religion despite their contradictions. This means that multiple realities can co-exist even when they are at odds with each other.</p>



<p>We don’t live in just one reality – we switch between different realities (and play different characters within them). It’s a bit like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a>, where guests can explore different theme parks: Westworld, Shogunworld, Warworld, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to Westworld, it’s increasingly becoming more difficult to distinguish between what’s real and what isn’t. As Aaron Z. Lewis points out in his brilliant essay <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/">You Can Handle the Post-Truth</a>, we have created a fragmented reality with hyper-realistic CGI influencers, bots, deepfakes, AI pretending to be humans and humans pretending to be AI. We don’t live in a single timeline with a single history, but in a variety of “<em>contradictory reality bubbles</em>“.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/narrativeviolations.png"></p><p>Bruno Maçães paints a similar picture in his excellent book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52914599-history-has-begun">History Has Begun</a>. America, he believes, is in the process of transforming into a new, post-liberal society, distinct from current Western civilization. It’s a society that has not only been heavily shaped by television but one where reality and fantasy overlap.</p>



<p>This transformation has been in the making for a while: Kennedy had the aura of a movie star and leveraged his image through the medium of television. Nixon created the first political soap opera with the Watergate scandal. And with Reagan an actual movie star moved into the White House.</p>



<p>Trump is the ultimate culmination of this trend. His entire presidency feels scripted. His tweets end with <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265819308699070464?lang=en">cliffhangers</a>. A House of Cards screenwriter would not have been able to come up with a better story.</p>



<p>Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger used the social capital and entertainment skills they acquired as actors to appear more likable and competent as politicians, but at least they tried to be politicians. Trump, on the other hand, uses politics as another stage for his acting performance.</p>



<p><em>“Americans see the world as an action movie”</em> Maçães writes. I think this became especially apparent during the current covid-19 crisis and the most recent wildfires in California. People in my social media timelines seemed only superficially worried. Instead, their posts contained an underlying sense of excitement about real life finally catching up with the science fiction aesthetics of Blade Runner and Akira.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is Hollywood’s greatest achievement: It gets us excited about our dystopian future. The world might be ending, but at least it’s an ending that’s entertaining to watch.</p>



<p><iframe width="100%" height="348" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x_m9TUP_t_Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>If Hollywood created the fantasy worlds that reality is catching up with today, who is creating the fantasy worlds of tomorrow?</p>



<p>Maçães thinks the answer is Silicon Valley, which he describes as <em>“a fantasy land where engineering talent and capital come together to power the serious project of creating new worlds out of nothing”</em>. It’s one of the most idiosyncratic descriptions of how startups work that I have read. VCs are the new Hollywood studios; founders are the directors and actors.</p>



<p>A founder’s job is essentially to create the most compelling narrative of what their company will look like in 10 to 20 years time. <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">It’s not lying, it’s telling pre-truths</a>. Being contrarian just means that you came up with a novel fantasy plot no one else had thought of yet.</p>



<p>Sometimes founders are able to re-create the fantasy narratives of their pitch decks. Sometimes you end up with Theranos.</p>



<p>And even when you do end up with Theranos, at least you get material for an exciting new Netflix series. Perhaps VCs should buy the movie rights to the startups they invest in as a hedge against their biggest portfolio failures?</p>



<p>The concept of the tech industry as a creator of fantasy worlds immediately reminded me of a conversation I had with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cutler_max">Max</a> recently. His theory is that it’s not the lack of tech talent or venture capital that explains why Europe hasn’t been able to create a tech ecosystem on par with the US. It’s the absence of religiosity that has kept Europe from creating its own Google or Facebook. The US is able to create larger companies because it’s able to believe in larger and more ambitious narratives.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/escher.png"></p><p>Silicon Valley is not just creating new fantasy worlds, it is building tools that allow others to create their own fantasy worlds. Enter social media.</p>



<p>If TV has taught us to think of ourselves as characters in the story of our lives, then social media has allowed us to actually write and edit the script and build fictional characters. Social media is essentially the democratization of virtual world building.</p>



<p>As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook are just massive virtual status arenas that allow us to build social capital through signaling. Some of that social capital might be built on top of real stories and actual achievements, but most of it is not based on reality. Every time you are applying an Instagram filter, you are already changing reality.</p>



<p>It’s not just that we bend reality in our social media narratives, we also play different characters. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs74IH0mc">Chris Poole already pointed out</a> years ago, we all have multiple (online) identities. There is not just one reflection of yourself – identity is prismatic. Twitter-Julian (armchair intellectual) is not the same as Instagram-Julian (hobby photographer) or Facebook-Julian (high-school drinking buddy). Google Circles and Facebook Lists always got this wrong: They let us change who we shared <em>with</em>, but not who we shared <em>as</em>.</p>



<p>This is why social networking is not a winner-take-all market. We need different channels for our different, contradicting online personas. </p>



<p>The problem is not that we live in multiple realities or that these realities are sometimes at odds with each other. What’s problematic is that we sometimes get so immersed in one virtual world, that we forget about all the other realities – which brings us back to the problem of online conspiracies.</p>



<p>In Christopher Nolan’s Inception, Dom Cobb uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPy88-E2zo">a spinning tractricoid top that tells him if he is awake or still dreaming</a>. You can think of the mechanisms I describe in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/">Proof of X</a> as social media’s equivalent of the spinning top. As <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/10/you-can-rent-a-grounded-private-jet-to-take-instagram-photos.html">influencers rent grounded private jets</a> to pretend living a billionaire lifestyle, social networks introduce new proof-of-work hurdles to make sure our status games remain grounded in truth. Proof of reality.</p>



<p>It feels like some of the new virtual realities we have created need more than that. A kill switch that automatically brings us back to base reality.</p>



<p>So if you have reached this point of my essay, perhaps now would be a good time to close your browser window and enjoy real life. Or at least <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html">the closest simulation you have thereof</a>. </p>

<h2> Endorsements</h2>

<ul>

  <li> "My favorite machine learning book just received a face-lift!
    'Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction' is the most
    comprehensive and accessible book on modern machine learning by a
    large margin.  
    It now also covers the latest developments in deep learning and
    causal discovery. With this upgrade it will remain the reference
    book for our field that every respected researcher needs to have
    on their desk."  -- <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/">Max Welling</a>,
    U. Amsterdam 

    </li><li> "There are many books on machine learning out there, but none gives
    such a well-rounded, up-to-date, and comprehensive view of the
    field as this one. We use this book as reference reading for our
    students taking the advanced machine learning course at Oxford to
    introduce them to fundamental as well as current topics in the
    field. I'm amazed at the amount of work that went into this
    book---which will surely be used by many to train the next
      generation of machine learning experts."

Why grow a cyanobacteria in space you might say? Well what these little guys can do is convert carbon dioxide into oxygen gas for one, and secondly they can also be ingested as a protein substitute. It contains<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(dietary_supplement)#Food_and_nutrition"> 50-70% protein </a>by dry weight for starters, high in iron, and is nearly 300 cals / 100 g to boot. So in terms of a great symbiotic friend for a closed biome (i.e. a sealed steel ball in orbit), Spirulina is a pretty darn perfect room mate.</p><p>Okay I was hooked after a few videos from Youtube and Reddit. How do I get a sample of this West African extremophile? Turns out Amazon, among a myraid of products, also carries this...</p><p>So I ordered this from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.algaelab.org/">AlgaeLab</a> back when they had a Amazon store, it appears they don't have it anymore (July 2017). But they still do ship from their website. So take this in, I purchased a biological sample, shipping from California to Toronto, and it arrived in a little over a week with a bunch of Alkali salts without any major delay at customs. Are you kidding me? A biological sample and miscellaneous white powder can pass through the borders that easy, but I have had books delayed?!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501375207629_153452"><div>

Ever wonder why its called Spirlina? The cyanobacteria form a spiral-like shape when they get too much sunlight. Since sunlight is always going to come from one direction at a time (applied to one face), by rearranging into a spiral, only a fraction of total surface area is exposed. And what if the amount of light is too low and not ideal? They straighten out into a line to increase available surface area! How neat is that?</p><p>I bought a cheap $60 chinese microscope on Amazon (most of my projects start at amazon tbh) capable of 800x magnification and I took a cell phone picture through the cheap crappy plastic lenses. As you can see, spirals! Look at that!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_2_1501381010248_38600"><div>

I had a nice batch of algae, now should I do double or nothing?

Or maybe I should harvest these in a 5 micron cloth for consumption and grow a fraction of them again?</p><p>I decided to scale up the operation, and I was at this (below) amount of algae after another 10 days. I put an aquarium heater in the large sack of algae to maintain its temperature at ~32 C.</p><p>I also made this sack of plastic by buying a roll of vacuum pack freezer bag. Typically the vacuum pack machines use this uncut freezer bag material and they singe it closed to the correct size using a heated metal wire.

	<div>
		<p>Dear new developer,</p>
<p>I think that there are only really four tasks you need to do to do a good job as a new developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Say what you are going to do, then do it. This is all about communicating what you are working on. You can do this explicitly (via face to face communication or slack) or implicitly (via moving cards on a Trello board or Jira). The important part is to keep other people (who likely will have a better idea of the big picture) in the loop. Oh, and then you actually have to <strong>do</strong> the work.</li>
<li>Ask questions. <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/12/03/dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions/">Don’t be afraid</a>. This will help you do the work.</li>
<li>Don’t make the <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/11/26/making-mistakes-is-ok/">same mistake twice</a>. Learn from any that you make. This will help you do the work better in the future.</li>
<li>Show up <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/05/27/consistency-is-key/">consistently</a>. Sometimes you just have to grind. To do the work. (Is there an echo in here?)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can do these four things, you will stand out as a new developer. Why? It’s sad to say, but there are a lot of developers who aren’t very good. I’ve seen a few in my time. I’m not sure if they weren’t good because they were burned out, just didn’t care, didn’t have the skillset or the desire to learn, or were just in it for the money. Other times, I’ve seen developers get complacent, which is a foolish thing to do in this day and age (and a luxury that most new developers do not have). See also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20673437">this comment thread</a> on Hackernews about 20% of developers failing to be able to write <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fizzbuzz/problem">fizzbuzz</a>.</p>
<p>So, you don’t have to be brilliant to stand out. You do have to be good and consistent. And do the work.</p>
<p>Make sure you do all these, especially <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/09/25/over-index-in-your-first-few-months/">during the first few months</a>, and you’ll gain a reputation as a delight to work with. This reputation will follow you for years and continue to help you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Join us for the latest episode of Distributed, as Matt Mullenweg interviews Jack Dorsey, co-founder and CEO of Twitter and Square. They discuss how both companies have embraced remote collaboration, the underrated value of deliberate work, and how questioning preconceived models from the get-go can change everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This spring, Jack Dorsey told Twitter and Square employees they could work from home forever if they choose. But a year earlier –– before the global pandemic happened –– he had already started working from home two days a week. There wasn’t the noise or the distraction. It was a place and a time where he felt more freedom and creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, he reflects on how his way of working has evolved alongside Twitter and Square over the past year. From leading thousands of employees as a self-described introvert, to why he planned (and still does) to work from Africa for an extended period (spoiler: largely, to support entrepreneurs on the continent), Matt and Jack share ideas for combining the deliberate, thoughtful pace of asynchronous work with the serendipity that occurs in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we can run the company without missing a beat,” says Dorsey of planning to work in Africa, “it really opens the door for a lot, especially our ability to hire anywhere as well.”</p>



<p>Tune in to learn how meetings work at fully distributed Twitter and Square, what open source and the punk scene have in common, why bringing thoughtfulness into collaboration is more important than ever, and if Jack Dorsey ever wants to go back to the old board meetings. Plus a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>The full episode transcript is below. Thank you. </em></p>



<p>***</p>



<p>MATT MULLENWEG:&nbsp; Howdy, everyone and welcome to the Distributed podcast. Today’s guest does not need much in the way of introduction. He is the co-founder and CEO of Twitter and also the Founder and CEO of Square. In addition to creating three iconic products, Twitter, Square and Cash App, he has been a philanthropist and a world traveler. And what we’re going to focus on today is he has recently issued an invitation to all Twitter and Square employees to work from home forever if they want. So everyone please welcome Jack Dorsey. Jack, thank you so much for being here.</p>



<p>JACK DORSEY:&nbsp; Thanks for having me and making the time.</p>



<p>MATT: &nbsp; Now I know that you like to live your life intentionally and I’m curious about the intentions that you have set currently for those three things we talked about, those three iconic products – Twitter, Square and Cash App.</p>



<p>JACK:&nbsp; For Twitter, our intention is to serve the public conversation. It is our purpose and we believe global public conversation is just so important in that it elevates and amplifies some of the common problems we are all facing as a global community. Never has it been more true and a better manifestation than what we’ve seen with Covid and how the world was focused on one thing at the same time, which was pretty incredible to think about. And I think we’ll have a lot more of those.</p>



<p>So, having a place for global public conversation that is valuable and is not just built around and encouraging more people to spend time with it but actually you can walk away from it and you learn something is ultimately the intention to learn from it, not be distracted by it.</p>



<p>With Square, we have two ecosystems. And I call them ecosystems because they are this suite of tools that I think positively reinforce one another. And one is focused on sellers and the other is focused on individuals. So the little white reader was our beginning and it was a very simple tool to empower people into the economy, which was the company’s broader purpose, economic empowerment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it has grown into a series of tools that not just&nbsp; help you take a credit card but actually understand your business or understand your customers and all of the goal of helping you grow if you make informed decisions about the data you have around you. So that business has done very well and we have helped sellers around the world, mainly offline sellers, physical sellers.</p>



<p>And then Cash App, its intention – and this is broader for Square as well – is we see more and more people who don’t have a need for a traditional bank and being able to go to the app store, download something that you can store your money in, that you get a Visa card to spend that money around, you can go to an ATM and get actual paper cash or you can do things you couldn’t do at a traditional bank branch, like buy bitcoin or buy stocks, or fractions of stocks – if you can’t afford one share of a company that you love, you can buy five dollar’s worth of it.</p>



<p>And all these things ultimately lead to empowering people into the economy in a way they didn’t have access to in the past. Like the stock thing is a great example. There’s a lot of people that love Disney, a lot of people can’t afford one share of Disney. But I can spend five bucks on it and I can see that five bucks grow over time. And if I don’t like the stock market, the crazy weirdness that is Bit Coin has had similar performance or greater performance.</p>



<p>So that’s the intention for both, one, empowering public conversation because we just believe it’s so important to understanding our common problems that we’re facing, which we think there’ll be a lot more. And then Square and Cash App have an economic empowerment, just simple tools to empower people into the economy around them, which is very conversational and has a lot of parallels between the two.</p>



<p>MATT:&nbsp; You mentioned the fractional thing. I’m surprised by how many people tell me they can’t afford to buy Bitcoin. I’m like, you don’t need to.</p>



<p>JACK:&nbsp; Exactly. Yeah.</p>



<p>MATT:&nbsp; You can get one Satoshi worth and…</p>



<p>JACK:&nbsp; Yeah, exactly.</p>



<p>MATT:&nbsp; Related, what’s your intention for coming on this podcast about distributed work?</p>



<p>JACK:&nbsp; Anytime I go on a podcast I get feedback and I always have an opportunity to learn from the feedback. So hopefully I’m gonna learn from the conversation with you because you’ve been doing this for quite some time. But also I imagine our conversation will result in some feedback that I see on Twitter or in my email inbox about how I’m thinking and how it might be better evolved in this direction or if I consider something new. So it’s really to learn.</p>



<p>MATT:&nbsp; Well I’m excited about it. Thank you so much for coming by. I know that distributed work is not a new practice for you. Can you talk a little bit about your history with it?</p>



<p>JACK:&nbsp; The only reason I’m in this space, in technology, is because I benefited so deeply from open source early on. I was a kid growing up in St. Louis, Missouri and was active in the BBS community and when the BBSs finally got access to the internet through Washington University, it just opened the door to so much.</p>



<p>And for me it demystified a lot of how computers and networks work because I could actually see the source code based on this extreme generosity by others to share their work and to, I think more importantly, be okay with failing in public and being open in public. And it resonated with me a lot because I was in the punk scene, which is very much a pick up a guitar, be horrible at it for a while and then eventually you get better and better as you play in front of people and you do that uncomfortable yet courageous thing to put yourself out there.</p>



<p>And I saw a lot of the same patterns with open source. And these people were not in any one location. They happened to be all around the world. I mean, obviously (Linus?) [00:06:33.15] started in Finland and had a community across the internet that was helping him build something of immense complexity that had incredible value and it was all visible. And not just the source code that made the operating system work but the way they worked together was visible. The way they disagreed was visible, the way they slowed each other down was visible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I guess I’ve been a student of these models for quite some time but they have been fairly limited in my direct experience to open source (rather than?) companies. And when we were starting our companies, we followed the giants who came before us, especially in Silicon Valley and most notably Google. There’s so many practices that we borrowed from Google to start both Twitter and Square, culturally, process wise, tools. Obviously we are entirely on a stack created by them for their own work and now is benefiting others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But one of the things I wish we would have questioned earlier is do we all need to be in one city, do we all need to be in an office, is that really required to make our work and to make our work valuable and to continue the urgency? I think open source is seen as inherently distributed but also I think slow, yet deliberate. And I think that deliberateness is undervalued and the focus on slow is overvalued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And I think you can go into the patterns and still have all the benefits of having something that is more distributed, that is more global that could be fast and could maybe not be as deliberate so that we’re working mistakes much faster than we’re learning from at scale. When we were starting these companies, we just drafted off a bunch of assumptions that this was how you build a company, rather than questioning some of the fundamentals.</p>



<p>And I’m really happy now in that most of the entrepreneurs that I meet today are starting out questioning all that and starting out with an intention of not having an office, being fully distributed. And that’s meeting the expectations that I experience when I go to recruiting conferences of kids who are coming out of&nbsp; university and asking, as a first question, do I have to move to San Francisco? Can I work from home? Whereas like five years ago, that was not the first question but now predominantly it is. And I think that signal is …</p></div></div>

			<p><i>Happy Holidays. This week we are reprinting our top stories of 2020. This article first appeared online in our “Outbreak” issue in April, 2020.</i></p>
<p><span>I</span>’m no stranger to forced isolation. For the better part of my 20s, I served as a nuclear submarine officer running secret missions for the United States Navy. I deployed across the vast Pacific Ocean with a hundred other sailors on the USS Connecticut, a Seawolf-class ship engineered in the bygone Cold War era to be one of the fastest, quietest, and deepest-diving submersibles ever constructed. The advanced reactor was loaded with decades of enriched uranium fuel that made steam for propulsion and electrical power so we could disappear under the waves indefinitely without returning to port. My longest stint was for two months, when I traveled under the polar ice cap to the North Pole with a team of scientists studying the Arctic environment and testing high frequency sonar and acoustic communications for under-ice operations. During deployments, critical-life events occur without you: holidays with loved ones, the birth of a child, or in my case, the New York Giants 2011-2012 playoff run to beat Tom Brady’s Patriots in the Super Bowl for the second time. On the bright side, being cut off from the outside world was a great first job for an introvert.</p><p>It’s been a month since COVID-19 involuntarily drafted me into another period of isolation far away from home. I’m in Turkey, where a two-week trip with my partner to meet her family has been extended indefinitely. There were no reported cases here and only a few in California in early March when we left San Francisco, where I run a business design studio. I had a lot of anticipation about Turkey because I’d never been here. Now I’m sheltering in a coastal town outside of Izmir with my partner, her parents, their seven cats, and a new puppy.</p><p>Shuttered in a house on foreign soil where I don’t speak the language, I have found myself snapping back into submarine deployment mode. Each day I dutifully monitor online dashboards of data and report the status of the spread at the breakfast table to no one in particular. I stay in touch with friends and family all over the world who tell me they’re going stir crazy and their homes are getting claustrophobic. But if there is one thing my experience as a submarine officer taught me, it’s that you get comfortable being uncomfortable.</p><figure data-alt="Weiner_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17074_4fe560444cca7edf1c75e4fa492ff7d2.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>OFFICER OF THE DECK:</strong> Author Steve Weiner in 2011, on the USS Connecticut, a nuclear submarine. Weiner was the ship’s navigator. Submarine and crew, with a team of scientists, were deployed in the Arctic Ocean, studying the Arctic environment and testing high frequency sonar and acoustic communications for under-ice operations.</span><span>Courtesy of Steve Weiner</span></figcaption></figure><p>My training began with psychological testing, although it may not be what you think. Evaluating mental readiness for underwater isolation isn’t conducted in a laboratory by clipboard-toting, spectacled scientists. The process to select officers was created by Admiral Hyman Rickover—the engineering visionary and noted madman who put the first nuclear reactor in a submarine—to assess both technical acumen and composure under stress. For three decades as the director of the Navy’s nuclear propulsion program, Rickover tediously interviewed every officer, and the recruiting folklore is a true HR nightmare: locking candidates in closets for hours, asking obtuse questions such as “Do something to make me mad,” and sawing down chair legs to literally keep one off balance.<br></p><p>Rickover retired from the Navy as its longest-serving officer and his successors carried on the tradition of screening each officer candidate, but with a slightly more dignified approach. Rickover’s ghost, though, seemed to preside over my interview process when I applied to be a submariner as a junior at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. I was warned by other midshipmen that I would fail on the spot if I initiated a handshake. So, dressed in my formal navy blue uniform and doing my best to avoid tripping into accidental human contact, I rigidly marched into the Admiral’s office, staring straight ahead while barking my resume. When I took a seat on the unaltered and perfectly level chair in front of his desk, the Admiral asked me bluntly why I took so many philosophy classes and if I thought I could handle the technical rigors of nuclear power school. My response was a rote quip from John Paul Jones’ “Qualifications of a Naval Officer.” “Admiral, an officer should be a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor.” My future boss looked at me, shook his head like he thought I’d be a handful, and told me I got the job.</p><blockquote><p>Confinement opened something up in my psyche and I gave myself permission to let go of my anxieties.</p> </blockquote><p>Nuclear power training is an academic kick in the face every day for over a year. The curriculum is highly technical and the pedagogy resembles a cyborg assembly-line without even a hint of the Socratic method. Our grades were conspicuously posted on the classroom wall and a line was drawn between those who passed and those who failed. I was below the line enough to earn the distinguished dishonor of 25 additional study hours each week, which meant I was at school at 5 a.m. and every weekend. This is how the Nuclear Navy builds the appropriate level of knowledge and right temperament to deal with shipboard reactor operations.<br></p><p>I finally sat down for a formal psychological evaluation a few months before my first deployment. I was ushered into a room no bigger than a broom closet and instructed to click through a computer-based questionnaire with multiple-choice questions about my emotions. I never did&nbsp; learn the results, so I assume my responses didn’t raise too many red flags.</p><p>During my first year onboard, I spent all my waking hours either supervising reactor operations or learning the intricacies of every inch of the 350-foot tube and the science behind how it all worked. The electrolysis machine that split water molecules to generate oxygen was almost always out of commission, so instead we burned chlorate candles that produced breathable air. Seawater was distilled each day for drinking and shower water. Our satellite communications link had less bandwidth than my dial-up modem in the 1990s and we were permitted to send text-only emails to friends and family at certain times and in certain locations so as not to risk being detected. I took tests every month to demonstrate proficiency in nuclear engineering, navigation, and the battle capabilities of the ship. When I earned my submarine warfare qualification, the Captain pinned the gold dolphins insignia on my uniform and gave me the proverbial keys to the $4 billion warship. At that point, I was responsible for coordinating missions and navigating the ship as the Officer of the Deck.</p><div>

</div><p>Modern submarines are hydrodynamically shaped to have the most efficient laminar flow underwater, so that’s where we operated 99 percent of the time. The rare exception to being submerged is when we’d go in and out of port. The most unfortunate times were long transits tossing about in heavy swells, which made for a particularly nauseated cruise. To this day, conjuring the memory of some such sails causes a reflux flashback. A submariner’s true comfort zone is beneath the waves so as soon as we broke ties with the pier we navigated toward water that was deep enough for us to dive.<br></p><p>It’s unnatural to stuff humans, torpedoes, and a nuclear reactor into a steel boat that’s intentionally meant to sink. This engineering marvel ranks among the most complex, and before we’d proceed below and subject the ship and its inhabitants to extreme sea pressures, the officers would visually inspect thousands of valves to verify the proper lineup of systems that would propel us to the surface if we started flooding uncontrollably and sinking—a no-mistakes procedure called <i>rigging for dive</i>. Once we’d slip beneath the waves, the entire crew would walk around to check for leaks before we’d settle into a rotation of standing watch, practicing our casualty drills, engineering training, eating, showering (sometimes), and sleeping (rarely). The full cycle was 18 hours, which meant the timing of our circadian cycles were constantly changing. Regardless of the amount of government-issued Folger’s coffee I’d pour down my throat, I’d pass out upon immediate contact with my rack (the colloquialism for a submarine bunk in which your modicum of privacy was symbolized by a cloth curtain).</p><p>As an officer, I lived luxuriously with only two other grown men in a stateroom no bigger than a walk-in closet. Most of the crew slept stacked like lumber in an 18-person bunk room and they all took turns in the rack. This alternative lifestyle is known as hot-racking, because of the sensation you get when you crawl into bedding that’s been recently occupied. The bunk rooms are sanctuaries where silence is observed with monastic intensity. Slamming the door or setting an alarm clock was a cardinal sin so wakeups were conducted by a junior sailor who gently coaxed you awake when it was time to stand watch. <i>Lieutenant Weiner, it’s time to wake up. You’ve got the midnight watch, sir.</i> Words that haunt my dreams.</p><blockquote><p>The electrolysis machine was out of commission, so we burned chlorate candles that produced breathable air.</p> </blockquote><p>I maintained some semblance of sanity and physical fitness by sneaking a workout on a rowing erg in the engine room or a stationary bike squeezed between electronics cabinets.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Now that 2020 is (finally!) over, we highlight the changes and additions Elasticsearch received during the year, that we believe could make a big difference to you - a developer working with Elasticsearch.</p><div><div><p>What a year 2020 has been! Social distancing and a lot of very weird situations. For some it was a year full of difficulties, and hopefully a lot of growth and some good things too.</p><p><span>It has definitely been an interesting year for Elasticsearch. Many things happened, new features added and the product evolved significantly. We wanted to recap and share highlights of new features and usage recommendation. This post is about the things we consider as big changes, and important steps forward, based on our experience and what we see as important while actively working with hundreds of customers on Elasticsearch clusters of all shapes and sizes, from full-text search to log analytics and anomaly detection.</span><br></p><p><span>As always, upgrading to a more recent Elasticsearch version will grant you significant performance boosts, depending on your usage. This year as well, Elasticsearch has seen many performance and memory optimizations, most notably in the 7.8 and 7.9 releases. Those are too many and too low-level to list in detail here, so we won't.</span><br></p><p><span>In this post we will focus on high-level technical details that we believe could make a big difference to you - a developer working with Elasticsearch. For the sake of brevity, we will only highlight, and give you links for further investigation.</span><br></p><p>One important note about licensing, before we start: recently, many new features are added under the X-Pack license, and not as part of the open-source product. Most are indeed free (X-Pack Basic) but some require a paid subscription license. In this post, we are focusing on the features that we believe are important to know about, and will be useful to you - but are still in the free tier and usable without purchasing a license.<br></p><p>Here it goes.</p><h2>Better results scrolling using PIT</h2><p>There are three ways to page through search results (aka "do paging") in Elasticsearch: from/size, scroll, and search_after.&nbsp;<span>Each has it's downsides (slowness, instability of result sets, the requirement to sort on a field, and so on).&nbsp;</span><span>In recent Elasticsearch versions a new API was added, namely the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/point-in-time-api.html">PIT (Point in Time) API</a></span><span>. Essentially, it is a lightweight version of the scroll API and is meant to replace it, making deep paging possible and more efficient but still some limitations remain.</span></p><p><span>Our recommendation is to still not</span><span>&nbsp;over-use it - and in general avoid deep paging with Elasticsearch. But when you do need to scroll, e.g. for copying data to external jobs and so on - prefer the new PIT API over the (now discouraged) scroll API.&nbsp;</span><span>A good summary and discussion are in the </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/paginate-search-results.html">official documentation for the PIT API</a><span>.</span></p><h2>Ingestion using a single Agent, and Fleet</h2><p>In 2020 Elastic has moved off the premise of having many beats (Filebeat, Packetbeat, Metricbeat and so on), to supporting a single data collection agent that can deliver all that functionality. Under the hood the Elastic Agent runs all the beats, but it's going to be easier to deploy and manage the unified Elastic Agent. Also new is the option of managing them through <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/fleet-overview.html">Fleet</a>, and a centralized Ingest Manager in Kibana. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-elastic-agent-and-ingest-manager">Read more here</a>.</p><h2>Data Streams</h2><p>In essence, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/data-streams.html">Data Streams</a> is just an improved API and a better user-experience for using the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/indices-rollover-index.html">Rollover API</a> for partitioning data into more indexes. In the last couple of years we stopped using shards and moved to index-level sharding - essentially partitioning the data to different indexes, and the new Data Streams API plays an important role in making your clusters more efficient and more stable.</p><h2>Composable index templates</h2><p>Composable index templates were introduced in Elasticsearch 7.8, and are in fact a results of a <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/21105">4-year long discussion started in 2016</a>. With composable index templates you finally get a fine-grained control over how templates are built and applied, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/index-templates.html">see the docs</a> for a comprehensive discussion and example.</p><h2>Transform APIs</h2><p>The Transform APIs became GA since 7.7, and in their core they are essentially a managed ETL process run by Elasticsearch within the Elasticsearch cluster, to copy and transform data from one index to another.</p><p><span>This allows for compacting ("roll up"), executing self-joins on write (e.g. folding events into a session), enriching and cleaning up data from the ingest layer into indexes that will serve the serving layer. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/transform-apis.html">See the docs here</a>.</span></p><p><span>Our recommendation is to keep using dedicated ETL tools for any real-world or heavy use-cases, and to only use the Transforms API for minor use-cases, or during development.&nbsp;We usually prefer running ETLs with tools that were built to do it - like Flink, Airflow, Nifi and such, as they provide&nbsp;significantly better development experience, ability to debug, write testable code, and much more predictable and </span>manageable<span>&nbsp;ETL processes.</span></p><h2>Asynchronous search API</h2><p>The async search API lets you asynchronously execute a search request, monitor its progress, and retrieve partial results as they become available. It was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.7, and is designed to support more responsive search experience. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/async-search.html">See the docs here</a>.</p><h2>Improved support and performance for geo-search</h2><p><span>Geo-spatial search got a lot of love in 2020, most notably by making </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/bkd-backed-geo-shapes-in-elasticsearch-precision-efficiency-speed">geo-shapes BKD-backed in Elasticsearch</a><span>, which </span>translates<span>&nbsp;to significant precision, efficiency and speed gains. This also allowed to add more geo-types, queries and aggregations.</span></p><h2>New data types</h2><p><span>* </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/histogram.html">Histogram</a><span> - A field to store pre-aggregated numerical data representing a histogram. This data is defined using two paired arrays - values and counts.</span></p><p><span>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/constant-keyword.html">Constant keyword data type</a> -&nbsp;</span><span>Constant keyword is a specialization of the keyword field for the case that all documents in the index have the same value.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>* Arbitrary <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/shape.html">Shape</a> and Point data types -&nbsp;The shape data type facilitates the indexing of and searching with arbitrary x, y </span>Cartesian<span>&nbsp;shapes such as rectangles and polygons. It can be used to index and query geometries whose coordinates fall in a 2-dimensional planar coordinate system.</span></p><p><span>* </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/keyword.html#wildcard-field-type">Wildcard field</a><span> - A wildcard field stores values </span>optimized<span>&nbsp;for wildcard grep-like queries. Wildcard queries are possible on other field types but are usually slower and has analysis limitation (case sensitivity and others).&nbsp;The Wildcard field is an important addition - it finally allows a case insensitive wildcard search, and when used in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-as-you-type.html">search_as_you_type</a> field type it allows to provide great search experiences.</span></p><h2>New Aggregation types</h2><p>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-bucket-histogram-aggregation.html">Histogram Aggregation</a> - A multi-bucket values source based aggregation that can be applied on numeric values or numeric range values extracted from the documents<br>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-normalize-aggregation.html">Normalize Aggregation</a> - A parent pipeline aggregation which calculates the specific normalized/rescaled value for a specific bucket value.<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-normalize-aggregation.html*"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-normalize-aggregation.html*"><br></span></a>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation">Moving Percentiles Aggregation</a> - Given an ordered series of percentiles, the Moving Percentile aggregation will slide a window across those percentiles and allow the user to compute the cumulative percentile.<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation*"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-moving-percentiles-aggregation*"><br></span></a>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation">Moving Function Aggregation</a> - Given an ordered series of data, the Moving Function aggregation will slide a window across the data and allow the user to specify a custom script that is executed on each window of data.<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation*"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation*"><br></span></a>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-pipeline-inference-bucket-aggregation.html#search-aggregations-pipeline-inference-bucket-aggregation">Pipeline inference aggregation</a> -

A new aggregation that will tell you if the difference between two population means are statistically significant and did not occur by chance alone.<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-aggregations-metrics-ttest-aggregation.html*"><span data-auto-link="true" data-href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-aggregations-metrics-ttest-aggregation.html*"><br></span></a>* <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/search-aggregations-metrics-boxplot-aggregation.html">Box plot aggregation</a> - The boxplot aggregation returns essential information for making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plot</a>: minimum, maximum, median, first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile) values.</p><h2>New Query Language - EQL</h2><p><span>The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/introducing-event-query-language">Event Query Language (EQL)</a> is a query language for event-based time series data, such as logs, metrics, and traces. It's a new query language that was recently added to Elasticsearch, mostly aimed for SIEM users but not only. It joins the traditional Lucene query syntax and Elasticsearch JSON queries, and also the SQL support and Kuery - the Kibana query language. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.9/eql.html">Full docs here</a>.</span></p><h2>Kibana Lens</h2><p><span>For years Kibana was about creating simple visualizations that can be added as components to a dashboard, and only recently they started adding additional capabilities like Timelion, Visual Time Series Builder and Vega. Lens is the most recent addition, with the purpose of simplifying building dashboards even further.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/kibana-lens-now-generally-available">Lens</a> is the easiest and most intuitive way to visualize data in Elasticsearch with a simple drag-and-drop interface that lets anyone instantly begin exploring data for insights, regardless of their previous Kibana experience, which we think is a great new addition that will allow reducing the barrier of entry for new users beginning with Kibana.</span></p><h2>Alerting</h2><p><span>For a very long while, the Elastic Stack lacked support for alerting. There was Watcher</span><span>, which still exists, but it always was very limited and not trivial to use. It&nbsp;did start receiving a lot of improvements in the last 2 years or so, and very much so in 2020 when Alerting has become more streamlined all throughout Kibana. In 2020, a lot of features were added that help creating alerts, and good alerts, from pretty much everywhere in Kibana. However, most of the new Alerting features are on the premium (paid) tiers, and still has a lot missing for it.</span><br></p><p>This is good progress, but we still think there is a lot to go. A couple of months ago we reviewed all the possibilities to enable alerting on top of Elasticsearch <a href="https://bigdataboutique.com/ask-me-anything/2020-05-06-alerting-with-elasticsearch-and-the-elastic-stack">in a webinar</a>, and this content is still relevant today as well:</p><div contenteditable="false">

		<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a title="Shimano and associated bicycle manufacturers drop the Coasting program - Yannig Roth's blog" href="https://yannigroth.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/shimano-and-associated-bicycle-manufacturers-drop-the-coasting-program/" target="_blank">I noticed</a> that the Coasting-website (coasting.com) was not online anymore and that the landing page was Shimano’s corporate website, <a title="Shimano.com" href="http://www.shimano.com/" target="_blank">Shimano.com</a>. Just before writing this, I <span>g</span><span>o</span><span>o</span><span>g</span><span>l</span><span>e</span>d it again and there is <a title="Shimano Coasting homepage" href="http://www.shimanocoasting.com/" target="_blank">shimanocoasting.com</a> again, on the bottom of the page, just behind the link to my blog post (results may vary from country to country) ! Did I make a mistake, in March, when I was looking for the website ? Did I just miss it ?</p>
<p>But more interestingly, what bugs me is : What caused the Coasting program to fail ?</p>

Why ? (photo from ohgizmo.com)</p></div>
<p>In a very interesting <a title="Bicycle Design - Blog" href="http://bicycledesign.net/2008/06/guest-post-by-mark-sanders/" target="_blank">guest post on BicycleDesign.net</a>, <strong>designer Mark Sanders</strong> basically talks about the cycling market as bunch of companies which sell high-priced bicycles to enthusiast cyclists (he calls them red oceans of enthusiasts). On the other hand, you have the mass-merchandisers selling very low-priced bikes in chain stores and supermarkets, targeting the mass of shoppers. Since these two approaches make companies compete on very “crowded” markets with low margins, we can indeed talk about red oceans that Kim &amp; Mauborgne’s describe in their theory on business strategy, the <a title="Blue Ocean Strategy - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy" target="_blank">Blue Ocean Strategy</a>. In this theory, companies achieve growth by creating innovative ways to satisfy customers’ needs (differentiation), thus avoiding the high costs that incurr in highly competitive markets, and also driving up value for these customers. So is the <strong>cycling industry an unattractive industry ?</strong> According to Sanders, yes. I also think about an interview (in Institutional Investor of April 2005) of Martin Schwartz, CEO of Dorel Industries that I read when I got interested in <a title="No hands: The rise and fall of the Schwinn Bicycles Company: an American institution, Judith Crown &amp; Glenn Coleman, Henry Holt&amp;Co. - Yannig Roth Blog" href="https://yannigroth.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/no-hands-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-schwinn-bicycles-company-an-american-institution-judith-crown-glenn-coleman-henry-holtco/">Schwinn’s history</a> ; he says that “<em>bikes, it’s true, is not a great industry, but someone has to be the best, and Pacific</em> (bike division of Dorel, ed) <em>is the best by far</em>“. Shimano seemed to having recognized that, and that’s where the industry-giant worked with IDEO, a global design consulting firm, to find <a title="Shimano Coasting, design-thinking applied to the cycling industry - Yannig Roth's blog" href="https://yannigroth.wordpress.com/2009/12/13/shimano-coasting-design-thinking-applied-to-the-cycling-industry/" target="_blank">a solution : Coasting</a>.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph relates to both the Blue Ocean theory (2005) and the Design Thinking theory (2008) to describe Shimano’s initiative. IDEO is even run by the guy who wrote <a title="Design Thinking (June 2008) - Harvard Business Review" href="http://hbr.org/2008/06/design-thinking/ar/1" target="_blank">the HBR-article on Design Thinking</a>, Tim Brown. So Shimano was basically advised by one of the leading strategists in the world, but about 3 years after the lauch of the Coasting product-line, <strong>the program was abandoned</strong> because it didn’t generate the expected commercial success that Shimano hoped for. The program thrilled the design-community (<a title="Giant receives Coasting honors - BRAIN" href="http://www.bicycleretailer.com/news/newsDetail/285.html" target="_blank">California Design Biennal Award for Giant</a> in 2007, <a title="Shimano's Coasting project wins award - BRAIN" href="http://www.bicycleretailer.com/news/newsDetail/1634.html" target="_blank">International Design Excellence Award</a> in 2008), was praised by journalists and commentators (<a title="With these bikes, easy does it - L.A. Times" href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-gear4jun04,0,5314233.column" target="_blank">L.A. Times</a> or <a title="Trek Lime review - Cyclingnews.com" href="http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/tech.php?id=tech/2007/reviews/trek_lime07" target="_blank">Cyclingnews.com</a> in 2007), but sales didn’t follow. Why ?</p>
<p><strong>Several reasons</strong> cross my mind, and I’d like to have your feedback to contribute to the discussion…</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Design process ?</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Shimano’s brief for IDEO was more or less as follows : help it create a $1,000, tech-laden bike that would lure baby boomers  and their loose change off the couch (<a title="Coasting Bikes - bicycling.com" href="http://www.bicycling.com/article/1,6610,s1-1-324-15855-1-P,00.html" target="_blank">bicycling.com</a>). It is very common in the design process that the consulting firm<strong> reformulates this brief</strong>, and it indeed proved to be necessary. Aaron Slar, social engineer for IDEO, and David Lawrence, marketing manager for Shimano travelled to different U.S. cities to find out what people think about bikes and biking and discovered all these things about people being intimidated by technology and basically wanting to get the feel-good biking experience they remember from their childhood. The <strong>prototype</strong> had grinded lugs and cable routers, a coaster brake and, more importantly, an invisible shifting mechanism. When IDEO presented their findings and recommendations to Shimano in Japan, “<em>there was a long pause on the conference call. And it wasn’t just  because of the translation</em>“, says Lawrence. But the company rapidly got convinced, and started seeking partners within the industry.</p>

<p>This <a title="Design Thinking process picture - Pferdt.de" href="http://www.pferdt.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/design-thinking-process-stanford2.jpg" target="_blank">design process</a> seems to have gone through the traditional steps, from understanding to prototyping and testing. Actually, I found <strong>few information about this “testing”-step</strong>. Who did Shimano and IDEO work with when they testes their prototype(s) ? Where there improved V2 and/or V3 versions based on customers’ feedback ? This would be interesting to know.</p>

Today, the Shimano Coasting <a title="Shimano Coasting homepage" href="http://www.shimanocoasting.com/" target="_blank">website</a> shows 7 models from 7 different brands : <a title="Schwinn Bicycles" href="http://www.schwinnbike.com/usa/eng/" target="_blank">Schwinn</a>, <a title="K2 Bikes" href="http://eccyclesupply.com/k2bikes/">K2</a>, <a title="Phat Cycles" href="http://www.phatcycles.com/" target="_blank">Phat</a>, <a title="Fuji Bikes" href="http://www.fujibikes.com/" target="_blank">Fuji</a> and the 3 brands that started with Shimano. I wonder what caused the number of manufacturers to drop ? They were indeed 10 in 2008, why did <a title="Sun Bicycles" href="http://www.sunbicycles.com/" target="_blank">Sun</a>, <a title="Jamis Bicycles USA" href="http://www.jamisbikes.com/usa/index.html" target="_blank">Jamis</a> &amp; <a title="Electra Bike" href="http://www.electrabike.com/" target="_blank">Electra</a> quit the program ? One possibility is that Shimano could not handle working closely with these 10 manufacturers and needed to <strong>skim off the least motivated</strong> ones… While some talk about a synergy between this major supplier and manufacturers, I wonder if the manufacturer’s didn’t think that Shimano would <strong>get too powerful</strong> if Coasting was a success ? Would have one single bike manufacturer have been more successful with the Coasting-approach ?</p>

<p>Shimano’s goal was to get 1,000 U.S. retailers involved the first year. In 2008, two years after the lanch of the group, industry consultant Jay Townley of Gluskin Townley Group said <strong>retailers were still hesitant</strong> to adopt the new product. To improve this situation, Shimano sent them an explanatory DVD and did set up a dedicated website, sellingcoasting.com. But even this kind of initiatives did not make sales take off. When I talked to a bike dealer here in Pensacola he wasn’t very convinced by the Lime’s (Trek’s Coasting-model) ability to reach a new target of customers. If bike vendors don’t grasp it, the customer probably won’t either…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Marketing mix ?</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span>PRODUCT :</span> Did the consumer know what was actually sold by Shimano ? The company only sells the transmission and shifting-system by its Coasting group. This product is then mounted on the bikes by manufacturers, who sell the bicycle through independent bicycle dealers (IBD) in the United States. But Coasting is also a concept, a lifestyle, a new way of designing riding experience. I think it was made <strong>too hard for the customer to identify what he was actually buying</strong> : did he buy a Trek ? a “Coasting” ? a Shimano ? Who made what on this bicycle ? Why change the shifting-system ? I think it was not Shimano’s role to directly adress the customer, it is still the bike brands’ job to sell their products.</p>
<p><span>PRICE : </span>The 3 initial Coasting bikes sold between 400$ and 700$. The Trek Lime’s retail price was roughly 500$, which is a fair price for a quality bicycle. It is half the price of what Shimano initially suggested to IDEO in the design brief. The aim of this pricing strategy was obviously to make bikes affordable to a large public who doesn’t ride bikes. I think the price was not a reason for failure, it was more that Shimano and, more importantly, the manufacturers were <strong>not able to communicate the benefits</strong> of Coasting to retailers and customers.</p>

<p><span>PROMOTION :</span> The promotional strategy was intended to convey this feeling of freedom of riding a bicycle and to <strong>draw non-cyclists to the stores</strong> that sold Coasting. Newspaper advertising and guerilla marketing were used to increase awareness of Coasting, and the <strong>website <a title="Shimano Coasting homepage" href="http://www.shimanocoasting.com/" target="_blank">Coasting.com</a> was central</strong> to explain the concept and present bikes to consumers. The design of this flash-based website is fun and interactive, storytelling is used to involve the visitor (storytelling is part of the Design Thinking process, according to Tim Brown) and content encourages people to get on their bikes. Ideally Coasting bikes. Beside this, a <a title="Shimano Coasting Tour - Yannig Roth's Blog" href="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/shimano-coasting-tour-preview.jpg" target="_blank">demo-tour</a> was also organized in several U.S.-cities to bring the bikes to the poeple and encourage PR &amp; publicity.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_879"><p><a href="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-879" data-attachment-id="879" data-permalink="https://yannigroth.com/2010/05/12/what-caused-shimanos-coasting-program-fail/shimano3/" data-orig-file="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg" data-orig-size="600,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="shimano-coasting-marketing" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg?w=600" title="shimano-coasting-marketing" src="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg?w=730" alt="bike-lanes" srcset="https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg 600w, https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg?w=150 150w, https://yannigroth.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/shimano3.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-879">The Fineline used outdoor stencils (with environmentally friendly spray chalk) to create life sized coasting paths everywhere (photo from the-fineline.net)</p></div>
<p><span>PLACE : </span>Coasting was intended to the U.S.-market only, and it has been launched in cities like Orlando or Phoenix before the whole country was covered in 2008. Shimano and the bike brands chose to sell their products exclusively at IBDs. I think this is one of the reasons that caused Coasting’s failure : while the website is a good way of presenting the concept/product/bikes, poeple are often unfamiliar with the specialized bike stores and bike-enthusiastic vendors. Why not<strong> selling through the web ?</strong> Was the reliance on a retailing network so important ? It might have avoided some obstacles too… But more than seeing problems on the U.S. market, I think that Shimano should have tried to introduce Coasting (or a similar technology, with a different marketing approach) into<strong> less mature markets</strong> like China, India and other emerging countries. Or <strong>even (very) mature markets</strong> like Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, where product acceptance might have been higher.</p>
<h2>VERDICT ?</h2>
<p>The future of Shimano’s Coasting is unclear. On the internet, Coasting.com vanished and ShimanoCoasting.com has appeared, the content is unchanged. As I said in a <a title="Shimano and associated bicycle manufacturers drop the Coasting program - Yannig Roth's blog" href="https://yannigroth.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/shimano-and-associated-bicycle-manufacturers-drop-the-coasting-program/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, the program has been abandoned by Shimano because sales never attained the expected figures. I think there was a huge potential in this approach, and this post explains some points that could have led to Coasting’s deceiving results.</p>
<p>What do you think ? Do you have more informations ? More ideas ?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cincheo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/RPA_small.jpg" alt="">Hi! I am <strong>Renaud Pawlak</strong>, a passionate R&amp;D Software Engineer born in France in 1973 and an active programmer since I was 10. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and was once an <strong>INRIA researcher</strong> and a <strong>full-time professor in the US</strong> (RPI). Working mainly as a researcher and <strong>entrepreneur</strong>, I have created and helped many startups throughout my career and have created some technologies that are being used worldwide. </p>



<p>I have managed teams of developers and researchers. However, my favorite part of the job is the creation of new projects / technologies / products / tech companies. It is some sort of curse, being passionate about computers and software, but that’s how it is, I can’t help it!</p>



<p>A friend of mine once asked me if I had the list of all the projects I have been involved in… I said no, but the idea grew on me… So, here is a <strong>list of my most significant achievements and projects starting in 1983</strong>. <em>(NOTE: this is not a Résumé – résumés are experience-oriented… this is project-oriented.)</em></p>

                <p>Message Queues are now fairly prevalent—there are so many of them showing up so fast you'd think they were <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">rabbits</a> with an unlimited supply of <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/">celery</a>, resulting in an <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">kafkaesque</a> situation where making a decision is like trying to catch a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro">stream</a> in your hands. If only there were fewer <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns">simple</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">services</a> that could help with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">publishing and subscribing</a>, it would be so much easier to make a <a href="https://zeromq.org/">zero-effort</a> choice 😕</p><p>Whether we use them by themselves as-is to move data between parts of our application, or as an integral part of the architecture (like event driven systems), message queues are here to stay. In a way, they've been here all along—just without as many names. But what are they? Why are they useful? And how do we use them effectively? Which implementation do we pick? Does it even matter which one we use? And do we need to learn each of them individually, or are there more general concepts that apply to all message queues?</p><p>In this guide, we'll talk about:</p><ul><li>What message queues are and their history.</li><li>Why they're useful and what mental models to use when reasoning about them.</li><li>Delivery guarantees that the queuing systems make (at-least-once, at-most-once, and exactly-once semantics).</li><li>Ordering and FIFO guarantees and how they effect sequencing, parallelism and performance.</li><li>Patterns for fan-out and fan-in: delivering one message to many systems or messages from many systems into one.</li><li>Notes on the pros and cons of many popular systems available today.</li></ul><h2 id="what-are-message-queues">What are message queues?</h2><p>Message Queues are a way to transfer information between two systems. This information—a message—can be data, metadata, signals, or a combination of all three. The systems that are sending and receiving messages could be processes on the same computer, modules of the same application, services that might but running on different computers or technology stacks, or entirely different kinds of systems altogether—like transferring information from your software into an email or an SMS on the cellphone network.</p><p>The idea of a messaging system has been around a very long time, from the message boxes used for moving information between people or office departments (literally where the words <em>inbox </em>and <em>outbox</em> come from), to telegrams, to your local postal or courier service. The messaging systems in the physical world that come closest to what we have in computing are probably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube">pnuematic</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pneumatic+tubes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1366">tubes</a> that moved messages through buildings and cities using compressed air until a few decades ago (and are still used in some places today).</p><p>The kinds of messages we transfer today might be a note that something technical happened, like CPU usage exceeding a limit; or a business event of interest, like a customer placing an order; or a signal, like a command that tells another service to do something. The contents of each message will be driven entirely by the architecture of your application and its purposes—so for the rest of this guide, we don't need to be concerned about what's inside a message—we're more concerned with how the message gets from the system where it originates (the <em>producer</em>, <em>source, publisher</em> or <em>sender</em>) to the system where's it's supposed to go (the <em>consumer</em>, <em>subscriber</em>, <em>destination</em> or <em>receiver</em>).</p><h2 id="and-why-do-we-need-them">And Why Do We Need Them?</h2><p>We need message queues because no system exists or works in isolation—all systems need to communicate with other systems in structured ways that they both can understand, and at a controlled speed that they both can handle. Any non-trivial process needs a way to move information between each stage of the process; any workflow needs a way to move the intermediate product between the stages of that workflow. Message queues are a great way to handle this movement. There are plenty of ways of getting these messages around using API calls, file systems, or many other abuses of the natural order of things; but all of these are ad-hoc implementations of the message queue that we sometimes refuse to acknowledge we need.</p><p>The simplest mental model for a message queue is a very long tube that you can roll a ball into. You write your message on a ball, roll it into the tube, and someone or something else receives it at the other end. There are a lot of interesting benefits with this model, some of which are:</p><ul><li>We don't need to worry about <em>who or what</em> is going to receive the message – that's one less responsibility for the sender to be concerned about.</li><li>We don't need to worry about <em>when</em> the receiver is going to pick up the message.</li><li>We can put <em>as many</em> messages as we want into the tube (let's assume we have a infinitely long tube) at whatever <em>speed</em> is comfortable to us.</li><li>The receiver will <em>never be impacted</em> by our actions—they will pull out as many messages as they want at whatever rate is comfortable to them.</li><li>Neither the sender nor the receiver are concerned with <em>how</em> the other works.</li><li>Neither the sender nor the receiver are concerned with the <em>capacity or load</em> of the other.</li><li>Neither system is concerned with <em>where</em> the other one is – they may or many not reside on the same computer, network, continent or even the same planet.</li></ul><p>Each of these advantages (and this isn't even an exhaustive list) has very important benefits in software development—what they all have in common is <em>decoupling</em>. One system is decoupled from the other in terms of responsibility, time, bandwidth, internal workings, load and geography. And decoupling is a very desirable part of any distributed or complex system—the more decoupled the parts of the system are, the easier it is to independently build, test, run, maintain and scale them.</p><p>Most systems interact with other outside or third-party systems as well—if we build a shopping site we might interact with a payment processor, and let’s say we attempt to directly communicate with the payment processor on each user click. If our system is under heavy load, we're also subjecting the other system to the same load. And vice versa—if our payment provider needs to send us millions of pieces of information about our past payment statues, our system better be ready. The two systems are now <em>coupled</em>. The decisions and actions made by one system have a significant impact on the other, so the needs of both need to be taken into account while making every decision. Add enough other systems into the mix, like logistics or delivery systems, and we quickly have a paralysing mess that makes it difficult to decide anything at all. If one system goes down, the other systems have effectively gone down as well, for no fault of their own.</p><p>We’re also in trouble if we want to switch out any one of these systems for another one, like a new payment processor or delivery system. We’d have to make deep changes in multiple places in our application, and it’s even more difficult to build code to split our messages between multiple providers—we may want to use a ratio to load balance them or split them by geography; or dynamically switch between them based on each provider’s availability or cost.</p><p>Message queues offer the decoupling that solves a lot of these problems. If we set up a queue between two systems that need to communicate with each other, they can now go about their work without having to worry about each other at all—we put our messages aimed at any system into a queue, and we expect information from the other system to come to us through another queue as well. We now have clear points at which we can add rules or make the changes we require, without either system knowing or caring about what's different.</p><h3 id="so-what-s-the-catch">So what's the catch?</h3><p>Are message queues the holy grail of computing, though? Do they solve all the world's problems? No, of course not. There are plenty of situations where we might not want to use them. And we certainly don't want to use a queue just because we have one easily available and think it might be fun. There are some systems that are really simple that just don't require it—a message queue is a way to reduce to complexity of communicating systems, but two communicating systems will always be more complex than one system that doesn't have to communicate. If you have a system that’s simple enough to not require communication with any others, there simply isn't any reason to reach for a queue.</p><p>There are also systems that communicate with each other, but where the complexity added by that communication added is insignificant and not worth worrying about. Or more often the systems are already coupled, in the sense that they all need to work together to function. A really common example is an application server and a data service (in an <em>OLTP</em> system). There's not much point in decoupling them with a queue, because neither can do anything useful without the direct involvement of the other.</p><p>Then there's performance to consider as well—the whole point of decoupling two systems with regards to time and load is so that they can each process information at their own pace—but we certainly would <em>not</em> want this to happen in performance sensitive applications or real-time systems. A queue might help us process more work at the same time (the receiver might have many processes working in parallel on the messages you send) but will remove any guarantees we need about the exact time taken for each piece of work. If predictability is more important than throughput, we're better off without a queue.</p><p>Using a queue might increase the time taken to process each <em>individual</em> message, but will allow you process many more messages at the same time across different computers—so your total number of messages processed per minute or hour, or <em>throughput</em>, will increase.</p><p>If we do have multiple systems that need to communicate, and that communication needs to be <em>durable </em>(if we’ve put a message into a queue, we want to be sure that the messaging system isn’t going to ‘forget’ about it) and decoupled, a message queue is indispensable.</p><h2 id="arguing-semantics">Arguing Semantics</h2><p>There's simply no way to learn about message queues without reading and/or arguing about delivery guarantees …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
        <p>I’ve enjoyed playing a game called Avalon recently. I won’t go too far into the rules, but it’s a <a href="https://www.bestplay.co/ultimate-guide-hidden-role-board-games/">hidden role game</a> in the vein of Secret Hitler or Werewolf, where one team is “good”, trying to uncover who among them is “evil”, before the evil team wins.</p>

<p>One of the characters you can play is Merlin. Merlin knows who the evil players are, but can’t reveal what he knows, because the evil team can kill Merlin and win the game. So Merlin relies on another character, Percival, to be his decoy.</p>

<p>Percival’s only power is that he knows who Merlin is. So he secretly watches Merlin’s actions throughout the game and amplifies those signals to the rest of the group. The typical strategy is for Percival to attract attention away from Merlin and towards himself.</p>

<p>But another, riskier strategy is for <em>Merlin</em> to play as though <em>he</em> is Percival. In this case, Merlin displays what he knows so shamelessly that he throws everyone off. The evil team, believing that no Merlin would be stupid enough to put himself out there like that, figures he must be Percival, and writes him off.</p>

<p>The Merlin-as-Percival strategy is bold, because it blatantly defies our expectations about how the game is won. To pull it off, Merlin must create confusion around his actions. He needs the other players to feel unsure about whether he’s being incredibly stupid or incredibly smart.</p>

<p>Increasingly, I think the “shameless” approach is becoming a dominant strategy today. It was first popularized in modern canon by Paris Hilton, who played the “dumb blonde heiress” stereotype so smoothly that everyone assumed she really was as stupid as she seemed.</p>

<p>Paris didn’t play by the “obvious” rules for famous people. She was widely derided by both media and her peers as at best, a train wreck, and at worst, a self-serving aggrandizer. And yet, people couldn’t stop talking about her. A decade later, Paris is now remembered as the mastermind behind the playbook that’s made the Kardashians, Jenners, and other celebrity socialites so successful.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that people were dismissive of Paris because validating her playbook would mean admitting that <em>they</em> were playing an inferior game. Everyone else had invested years into optimizing for the most legible version of the rules. They’d look silly if they were to admit she had found a better way of doing things.</p>

<p>Without getting into tiresome politics, the “shameless” strategy also defined the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. It was shouted down by people in both established political parties, because they were used to playing by the “obvious” rules, but I suspect that in a decade’s time, we’ll look back on that election and realize that it marked the beginning of an entirely new style of politics.</p>

<p>Ditto to, perhaps, the leadership styles of Mark Zuckerberg, who’s followed the “obvious” playbook for years, versus Jack Dorsey, who employs tactics that seem so obviously stupid (tweeting about fasting and meditation!) that we’re quick to write them off. And yet, I’d guess that Zuckerberg’s strategy makes him increasingly unlikeable and untrustworthy, in the same way that any major politician sticking to a pre-2016 playbook today is almost certainly not going to win.</p>

<p>The shameless strategy feels counterintuitive, because our first instinct is to want to punish that sort of behavior. And historically, those sanctions have been effective. Punishing outlandish behavior is an important aspect of cooperative governance: it preserves social order by ensuring that we all play by the same rules.</p>

<p>Today, it seems like punishing shamelessness only <em>increases</em> social rewards to the transgressor. What’s changed?</p>

<p>One explanation might be that it’s an expected effect of the blurring of social boundaries today. In the past, if the size of your community was finitely bounded (like a village, or an aristocratic social class), people didn’t enter or exit these communities as frequently. Under these conditions, sanctions are probably still effective, because members of the community want to be liked and accepted.</p>

<p>But the borders to online communities are much more fluid - perhaps even nonexistent. Under open borders, sanctions will backfire, because they just serve as a signaling boost for the transgressor, attracting outsiders who resonate with that person’s message. What’s meant to be punishment instead becomes a flare shot straight into the night sky.</p>

<p>The “establishment” mistakenly assumes that a shameless person wants the approval of their community, when it turns out that, much like any cult or counterculture, that person’s goal was to attract a following, regardless of who the members are. The disgust of one’s peers doesn’t matter anymore, because that disgust forms the basis for an entirely new community.</p>

<p>A common critique of shameless people is questioning their intelligence. But one of the most bizarre aspects here is it doesn’t actually matter how aware that person is of what they’re doing. The concept of a “genius mastermind” is itself outdated, because it assumes that someone needs to be in control. The shameless person is simply a host for a set of ideas, which, like any virus, will continue to propagate as long as there are willing hosts to receive it.</p>

<p>I’m not really sure what the long-term implications of shamelessness will be. I also don’t think that everybody has to employ this strategy to win (at least, I hope not!). But what I do know is when I see my peers rolling their eyes at someone or deriding them for being “shameless”, there’s a good chance that, instead of writing them off, we should examine their actions a bit more closely.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>If you pop out into space, you die. No oxygen to breathe, no ambient pressure makes your bodily fluids boil, UV radiation burns your skin to a crisp. It's not a good place to be for humans. So in order to survive, you need to bring a number of things along, commonly called the "life support system". This talk explains how this works!</p>

<p>How do oxygen generators and CO_2 scrubbers work? Do you need to heat or cool your craft? If you eat beans and fart a lot, do you ever get rid of the smell? Can you just fill your spacecraft with plants and live off them? <br> This talk goes through historic, present and future ways that life support is managed in spacecraft, spacesuits and future planetary outposts. It also explains why you have to breathe your own pee on the International Space Station. <br> (This is the logical followup to the two previous, german talks about how to fly spaceships and how to build them, from the GulaschProgrammierNacht 13 and 16)</p>

In so many ways, a remarkable piece of engineering.  Efficient, comfortable, and not so bad in the cargo territory.  In it’s plugin form, it can run 20-25 miles on pure EV power, and after that, it still chugs along at 40mpg.

But jumpin jehosephat.  Who the heck designed the dashboard?  It’s… it’s… nnnnng…. well… let me show you.</p></div>



<h2>The Dashboard – An Introduction</h2>



<p><br>First, lets take a look at the interior.  This is the 2019 Prius Prime dashboard, directly from Toyota’s brochure…</p>



<figure><a href="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="549" src="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1024x549.jpg 1024w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-300x161.jpg 300w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-768x411.jpg 768w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-1536x823.jpg 1536w, https://planet-geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/19-prius-prime-brochure-en_pdf__page_4_of_9_-2048x1097.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>Now before I go straight to the jugular, lets note a few positive aspects here.</p>



<ul><li>A large, centrally located touchscreen.  I like that.  It’s easy to reach, everyone in the car can see it, it’s bright and visible. </li><li>The steering wheel has easy to reach controls, right under the thumbs.  Nice.</li><li>The upper display (directly in front of the window) has 3 smaller screens that can show a variety of information panels.  The most obvious one is a speedometer, but the other options are battery usage, mileage, map directions, etc.  As compared to the Tesla, which puts everything on one display in the middle of the car, these secondary displays that ALWAYS display certain information is a nice touch.</li></ul>



<h2>Well, that’s nice, but what’s your beef?</h2>



<p>Sounds all peachy so far, right?  I mean, it looks all shiny and clean, so what’s wrong?</p>



<p>Turns out, plenty.</p>



<p>Lets start at the meta level.  That big central display?  It only controls a small subset of the car systems.  It’s a bad design to have to go hunting for an external button or switch or toggle or display to get a basic function that the display should have on it.</p>



<p>Another problem with the central display are the buttons on the glass on either side.  Those are flush contacts.  You have to look at them to determine if you’re pushing them, and there’s no feedback when you do.  Talk about distracted driver problems.  No feedback contact buttons should be used VERY CAREFULLY in motor vehicles.  Why some of these buttons are glass and others in the car are standard switches, I have no idea.</p>



<h2>Okay, but lets hear the real fails.</h2>



<p>Okay, you asked for it, lets start running down some absolutely batshit decisions made on this car.</p>



<ol><li>Lets start simple.  Seat heaters.  Everyone loves ’em, right?  Took us literally googling and watching youtube videos to figure out how to turn them on.  The controls for the seat heaters are tucked under the dash, on either side of the central console.  Once I scrunched down in the seat, bent my head to one side, I was able to see them.  My wife, who is a foot and a half shorter than I am, never saw them either.  Who thought this was the appropriate placement for these switches?</li><li>Remember those little screens under the front windshield?  Nice, aren’t they?  Well, they are configurable.  You can change what each one shows.  At some point, my wife brought up “Hey, that middle display used to show how much battery time I had left, now it doesn’t.  How do you change that?” – I, a systems engineer, could absolutely not figure out how to change those displays.  The answer?  Tap the right arrow on the steering wheel right control pad.  No other feedback that this is how to do this – no menus, no prompts, no information – I had to google this one too.  There’s nothing on that nice big central display that lets you configure these smaller displays.  They are completely separate.</li><li>At one point we were driving around at night, and I was wondering why the central screen was so bright.  Most cars switch into ‘night mode’ when it gets dark, but this screen was blazing white.  Going through all the menus, I found a screen setting for ‘DAY MODE’ ON/OFF – what exactly that means is sort of a mystery.  There was no NIGHT MODE ON/OFF.  Just that one toggle.  Turns out, you need to use the OTHER screen control.  The one on the left side of the steering column around knee height.  There’s a dial there that on older cars would set the brightness of the dashboard instruments.  Some bright engineer at Toyota decided that if that little knob was spun to a certain point, the central console would always be in day mode.  the DAY MODE apparently can override this setting?  Who knows – but having to go off-screen to some random control when the option should have been RIGHT THERE on the screen is definitely a fail.</li><li>Backup beeper.  Did you know the Prius has a backup beeper?  Going by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-up_beeper">Wikipedia</a> : <quote>A back-up beeper, also known as back-up alarm or vehicle motion alarm, is a device intended to warn passers-by of a vehicle moving in reverse. They typically produce 1000 Hz pure tone beeps at 97-112 decibels.[1] Matsusaburo Yamaguchi of Yamaguchi Electric Company, Japan, invented the back-up beeper. It was first manufactured as model BA1 in 1963.[2] ISO 6165 describes “audible travel alarms”, and ISO 9533 describes how to measure the performance of the alarms</quote><p>Great idea, right?  Except the Prius backup beeper SOUNDS INSIDE THE CAR.  Not externally.  You can’t hear it outside.  Who exactly is this supposed to be warning?</p></li><li>The mapping software sucks.  I mean, you just can’t get around it.  It’s cumbersome, it’s painful to use, the search functions are absolute shit, and it’s just a nightmare to try and use productively.  Took us another zillion years to figure out how to turn off the turn by turn navigation (you can’t except via a buried setting – makes listening to music really terrifying – why can’t you just say ‘turn off turn by turn for now, I’m listening to something cool, I don’t need the interruptions telling me that I’ll be on this interstate until the heat death of the universe.’</li><li>Most functions are disabled while in motion.  This seems to carry over from day 0 of cars getting anything more complicated than an FM stereo head unit.  Someone somewhere said “We should disable any function that may be a distraction to the driver, with no option to get around it”, and so it was.  But, what if you’re traveling in a modern vehicle that thoughtfully placed the navigation system between the driver and passenger seat, where the passenger has the same access as the driver, wouldn’t it make sense to allow the passe… NOPE!  Locked out!  You can’t modify your route or destination or settings while in motion.  DENIED.</li></ol>



<h2>Denoument</h2>



<p>I’m sure I’ll be adding to this list as more things come up.  What’s bothersome about all this is so much of this can be fixed in software.  But as far as I can tell, Toyota is following the auto manufacturer trend of assuming once a model year of a car is complete, so is the software, and it doesn’t need to change.  They may do minor tweaks and fixes, but they do not actually revise the systems with major improvements (unlike Tesla, who put out <a href="https://www.teslafi.com/firmware.php">major software updates pretty much constantly</a>, frequently adding new features or overhauling others).  </p>



<p>It may sound like I’m bashing Toyota and ignoring flaws in other manufacturers.  That’s not the case at all.  I’ve written in the past about <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2019/09/02/ev-cars/everything-wrong-with-my-tesla-model-3-performance/">my issues with the Tesla Model 3</a>, and while I didn’t have a lot of complaints about my <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/05/09/geekitude/one-week-with-the-chevy-volt/">Chevy Volt</a>, there were some <a href="https://planet-geek.com/2015/07/30/hacks/ownstar-vulnerability-in-onstar-application-for-gm-vehicles/">frustrations with GM</a>.  (In fact, I had some UX problems with the Volt as well, but the Volt didnt’ have the big touchscreen that SHOULD have made those problems easy to fix.)</p>



<p>Modern car manufacturers absolutely need to get on board, and stop thinking of the dashboard with a touchscreen as just a ‘shiny’ version of the old knobs and dials dashboards.  It’s a fully functioning digital information and control system, and should be treated as such, with regular updates, and some put into UX design.  Tesla is the only company that is doing this right.  What the heck is everyone else thinking?</p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

    

    <h2 id="choosing-the-right-distro"><a href="#choosing-the-right-distro">1. Choosing the right Linux distribution</a></h2>

    <p>
      There are many factors that go into choosing a good Linux distribution.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid distributions that freeze packages as <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#debian">they are often quite behind on security updates</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use a distribution with an init system other than <a href="https://systemd.io/">systemd</a>. systemd contains a lot of unnecessary
        attack surface; <a href="https://ewontfix.com/14/">it attempts to do far more things than necessary</a> and goes beyond what an
        init system should do. An init system should not need many lines of code to function properly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Use <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> as the default C library. musl is heavily focused on minimality which <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/90147#issuecomment-643473182">results in very small attack surface</a> whereas other C libraries
        such as glibc are overly complex and prone to vulnerabilities. For example, <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-72/product_id-767/GNU-Glibc.html">
        over a hundred vulnerabilities in glibc have been publicly disclosed</a> compared to the <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-16859/product_id-39652/Musl-libc-Musl.html">
        very few in musl</a>. While counting CVEs by itself is often an inaccurate statistic, it can sometimes be used to represent an overaching issue such as
        in this case. musl also has <a href="https://www.dustri.org/b/security-features-of-musl.html"> decent exploit mitigations</a>, particularly its
        <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2020/05/13/1">new hardened memory allocator</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preferably use a distribution that utilizes <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> by default rather than <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">
        OpenSSL</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/openssl-code-beyond-repair-claims-creator-of-libressl-fork/">OpenSSL contains
        tremendous amounts of totally unnecessary attack surface and follows poor security practices</a>. For example, it still maintains OS/2 and VMS support —
        ancient operating systems that are multiple decades old. These abhorrent security practices are what led to the dreaded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed vulnerability</a>. LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL by the OpenBSD team that applies
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreSSL#Changes">superior programming practices</a> and <a href="https://opensslrampage.org/">eradicates
        a lot of attack surface</a>. Within LibreSSL's first year, <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/libtls-fsec-2015/mgp00005.html">it mitigated a
        large number of vulnerabilities, including a few high severity ones</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div><p>
      The best distribution to use as a base for your hardened operating system would be <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> as it allows you to configure
      your system exactly how you want it to be which will be extremely useful, especially when we come to <a href="#hardened-compilation-flags">more secure compilation
      flags</a> later in the guide. </p><p>
      
      However, Gentoo may not be feasible for many people due to its significant usability pitfalls. In this case, <a href="https://voidlinux.org/">Void Linux</a>'s musl
      build is a good compromise.
    </p></div>

    <h2 id="kernel"><a href="#kernel">2. Kernels</a></h2>

    <p>
      The kernel is the core of the operating system and is unfortunately very prone to attacks. As Brad Spengler has once said, <a href="https://grsecurity.net/huawei_hksp_introduces_trivially_exploitable_vulnerability">it can be thought of as the largest,
      most vulnerable setuid root binary on the system</a>. Thus, it is very important for the kernel to be hardened as much as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stable-vs-lts"><a href="#stable-vs-lts">2.1 Stable vs. LTS kernels</a></h3>

    <div><p>
      The Linux kernel is released under two main forms: stable and long-term support (LTS). Stable releases are more recent whereas LTS
      releases are an older stable release that is being supported for a long time. <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/the_truth_about_linux_4_6">
      There are many consequences to choosing either of the aforementioned releases</a>. </p><p>
      
      The Linux kernel <a href="https://grsecurity.net/reports_of_cves_death_greatly_exaggerated">does not use CVEs to identify security
      vulnerabilities properly</a>. This means that fixes for most security vulnerabilities are not able to be backported to LTS kernels;
      but stable releases contain all security fixes made so far. </p><p>
      
      With those fixes however, a stable kernel includes a lot more new features, therefore vastly increasing the attack surface of the
      kernel and introducing a large amount of new bugs. On the contrary, LTS kernels have less attack surface because these features are
      not being constantly added. </p><p>
      
      Additionally, stable kernels include newer hardening features to mitigate certain exploits which LTS kernels do not. A few examples
      of such features are the <a href="https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/55105.html">Lockdown LSM</a> and <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2018/11/04/stackleak.html">STACKLEAK GCC plugin</a>. </p><p>
      
      To conclude, there is a trade-off when choosing a stable or LTS kernel. LTS kernels have less hardening features and not all public bug fixes
      at that point have been backported, but it generally has less attack surface and potentially a smaller chance of introducing unknown bugs.
      Stable kernels have more hardening features and all known bug fixes are included but it also has more attack surface and greater chances of
      introducing more unknown bugs. In the end though, a more recent LTS branch such as the 4.19 kernel would be preferred due to the much smaller
      attack surface.

    <h3 id="sysctl"><a href="#sysctl">2.2 Sysctl</a></h3>

    <p>
      Sysctl is a tool that allows the user to configure certain kernel settings and enable various security features or disable dangerous
      features to reduce attack surface. To change settings temporarily you can execute:
    </p>

    <pre><code>sysctl -w $tunable = $value</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      To change sysctls permanently you can add the one you want to change to <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> or the corresponding files within
      <code>/etc/sysctl.d</code>, depending on your Linux distribution. </p><p>
      
      The following are the recommended sysctl settings that you should change.
    </p></div>

    <h4 id="sysctl-kernel"><a href="#sysctl-kernel">2.2.1 Kernel self-protection</a></h4>

    <pre><code>kernel.kptr_restrict=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      A kernel pointer points to a specific location in kernel memory. <a href="https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Bug_Classes/Kernel_pointer_leak">
      These can be very useful in exploiting the kernel</a> but kernel pointers are not hidden by default — it is easy to uncover them by, for example,
      reading the contents of <code>/proc/kallsyms</code>. This setting aims to mitigate kernel pointer leaks. Alternatively, you can set
      <code>kernel.kptr_restrict=1</code> to only hide kernel pointers from processes without the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.dmesg_restrict=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg">dmesg</a> is the kernel log. It exposes a large amount of useful kernel debugging information but this
      can often leak sensitive information such as kernel pointers. Changing the above sysctl restricts the kernel log to the <code>CAP_SYSLOG</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.printk=3 3 3 3</code></pre>

    <p>
      Despite the value of <code>dmesg_restrict</code>, the kernel log will still be displayed in the console during boot. Malware that is
      able to record the screen during boot may be able to abuse this to gain higher privileges. This option prevents those information
      leaks. This must be used in combination with certain boot parameters <a href="#boot-kernel">described below</a> to be fully effective.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1
net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">eBPF exposes quite large attack surface</a>. As such, it must be restricted. These sysctls restrict eBPF
      to the <code>CAP_BPF</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> (<code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> on kernel versions prior to 5.8) and enable
      JIT hardening techniques such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9e4b0d55d84a66dbfede56890501dc96e696059c/include/linux/filter.h#L1039-L1070">constant blinding</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>dev.tty.ldisc_autoload=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      This <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/15/890">restricts loading TTY line disciplines</a> to the <code>CAP_SYS_MODULE</code>
      <a href="#capabilities">capability</a> to prevent unprivileged attackers from loading vulnerable line disciplines with the <code>TIOCSETD</code>
      ioctl which <a href="https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2017/03/24/CVE-2017-2636.html">has been abused in a number of exploits before</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>vm.unprivileged_userfaultfd=0</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <code><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html">userfaultfd()</a></code> syscall is <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=cefdca0a86be517bc390fc4541e3674b8e7803b0">often</a> <a href="https://duasynt.com/blog/linux-kernel-heap-spray">abused</a> to exploit use-after-free flaws. Due to this, this sysctl is used to restrict
      this syscall to the <code>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec is a system call that is used to boot another kernel during runtime</a>. This functionality can
      be abused to load a malicious kernel and gain arbitrary code execution in kernel mode so this sysctl disables it.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.sysrq=4</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/sysrq.html">SysRq key</a> exposes a lot of potentially dangerous debugging functionality
      to unprivileged users. Contrary to common assumptions, SysRq is not only an issue for physical attacks as <a href="https://github.com/xairy/unlockdown">
      it can also be triggered remotely</a>. The value of this sysctl makes it so that a user can only use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SAK.txt">
      secure attention key</a> which will be necessary for <a href="#accessing-root-securely">accessing root securely</a>. Alternatively, you can simply set the
      value to <code>0</code> to disable SysRq completely.
    </p>

    <pre><code>kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0</code></pre>

    <div><p>
      User namespaces are a feature in the kernel which aim to improve sandboxing and make it easily accessible for unprivileged users however, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#kernel">this feature exposes significant kernel attack surface for privilege escalation</a> so this sysctl restricts the
      usage of user namespaces to the <code>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</code> <a href="#capabilities">capability</a>. For unprivileged sandboxing,
      it is instead recommended to use a setuid binary with little attack surface to minimize the potential for privilege escalation. This topic is
      covered further in the <a href="#application-sandboxing">sandboxing section</a>. </p><p>
      
      Be aware though that this sysctl only exists on certain Linux distributions as it requires a kernel patch. If your kernel does not include
      this patch, you can alternatively disable user namespaces completely (including for root) by setting <code>user.max_user_namespaces=0</code>.
    </p></div>

    <pre><code>kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></pre>

    

    <h4 id="sysctl-network"><a href="#sysctl-network">2.2.2 Network</a></h4>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This helps protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood">SYN flood attacks</a> which are a form of denial of service attack
      in which an attacker sends a large amount of bogus SYN requests in an attempt to consume enough resources to make the system unresponsive to
      legitimate traffic.
    </p>

    <pre><code>net.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337=1</code></pre>

    <p>
      This protects against <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1337">time-wait assassination</a>…</p></div>

			<p><i>Happy Holidays. This week we are reprinting our top stories of 2020. This article first appeared online in our “Energy” issue in June, 2020.</i></p><p><span>D</span>ear Bella,</p><p>I’m going to imitate Rudyard Kipling and tell you a just-so story. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the world 100 years ago. He wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i>. And also <i>Just So Stories</i>, which began as bedtime stories he told his daughter Josephine. They were about how animals got their famous features, like the camel’s hump and the leopard’s spots. Kipling was a wonderful writer but he made up his animal stories. My story is based on science, which means many people, through many recent experiments, have concluded things might “just so” be the way of this story.</p><p>It’s also a story about evolution, which is nature’s research and development department. Like Kipling, I’ve given a human voice to certain things: Bacteria form committees and petition the research and development department for answers to their problems, as do plants and dinosaurs. And the R&amp;D department (which is to say, evolution) tries to come up with solutions. I’m going to call evolution “Mr. R&amp;D.” When he finds a problem, Mr. R&amp;D tests things out in different ways to come up with a solution. But sometimes those solutions have unforeseen consequences. So here we go!</p><blockquote><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. But why did dinosaurs have them?</p> </blockquote><p>Once upon a time, on a cold day in January, I was jogging through Regent’s Park in London, stepping carefully through flocks of geese, seagulls, pigeons, and ducks surrounding the boating lake. But, perhaps because of the book I had just been reading (Nick Lane’s <i>Oxygen</i>) my eye picked out a couple of geese that were strangers in this flock: Bar-headed geese, a boy and a girl.<br></p><p>But what were they doing in London in January? During the winter, they usually live in the middle of India, and in the summer they live in Kazakhstan or Mongolia. If you look at a map of the Earth, you can see the barrier between Kazakhstan and India is the Himalayan Mountain Range, the tallest in the world. Every year, millions of bar-headed geese migrate over the Himalayas and have been doing so for millions of years. They have been seen flying at 28,000 feet. They have flown over Mount Everest! How do they do that?</p><p>The answer seems to be that bar-headed geese, like all birds—hummingbirds, ostriches, pigeons—have super-efficient lungs. It makes our lungs—and the lungs of all mammals—look primitive. I’m sure when birds get together they gossip about how pathetic our lungs are!</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-1"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17339_169ea72d893b7bfe6a36b531a78b48af.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BIG AIR:</strong> Dinosaur’s lungs were so efficient that when oxygen levels rose over tens of millions of years, they were able to get very big—bigger than land mammals like elephants have ever gotten, or ever could get.</span><span>VectorPlotnikoff / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>All mammals, including us, breathe in through the same opening that we breathe out. Can you imagine if our digestive system worked the same way? What if the food we put in our mouths, after digestion, came out the same way? It doesn’t bear thinking about! Luckily, for digestion, we have a separate in and out. And that’s what the birds have with their lungs: an in point and an out point. They also have air sacs and hollow spaces in their bones. When they breathe in, half of the good air (with oxygen) goes into these hollow spaces, and the other half goes into their lungs through the rear entrance. When they breathe out, the good air that has been stored in the hollow places now also goes into their lungs through that rear entrance, and the bad air (carbon dioxide and water vapor) is pushed out the front exit. So it doesn’t matter whether birds are breathing in or out: Good air is always going in one direction through their lungs, pushing all the bad air out ahead of it.<br></p><p>How did birds get such great lungs? They inherited them from dinosaurs. Birds are dinosaurs! When I was growing up in the 1940s, there was a category in biology called Aves, which meant birds. But scientists have now folded Aves into a category called Dinosauria, and those dinosauria, like pigeons and seagulls and geese, are flying all around us today. If you want to know what a dinosaur probably tasted like, eat some chicken!</p><blockquote><p>Plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this.</p> </blockquote><p>So, dinosaurs had this super-efficient lung system, and they successfully strode the Earth as the dominant species, starting around 250 million years ago to about 65 million years ago, when a huge asteroid crashed into Mexico and most of them went extinct. Except for birds. But why did dinosaurs have this super lung system in the first place?<br></p><p>To answer that, we have to go way back, to when plants came out of the ocean onto land, about 450 million years ago. Earlier than that, plant life lived only in the ocean: The surface of the Earth was a desert.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity, some pioneer plants got together and said, “Let’s go!” and migrated up onto land. But once the plants got out of the water, they discovered something they never had to deal with in the ocean: gravity. In the ocean, if you’re a plant, you can just float, because the density of a plant is not that different from water. Out of the ocean, the density of a plant is much greater than air, and so gravity can pull it down.</p><p>So for many tens of millions of years, plants on land had to be happy sticking like moss to the surfaces of rocks. But they clearly resented this, and decided to form a committee to request an exemption from Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello. What’s your problem?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Our problem is gravity. We never had to deal with it in the ocean, and it’s a problem for us on land.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Why is gravity a problem for you?</p> <p><b>PC</b>: We want to do what we did in the ocean, which is absorb lots of sunlight, and the best way to do that is to have a long stalk, and then to have branches with leaves at the end of the branches and maximize our potential to absorb sunlight.</p> <p><b>MR. R&amp;D</b>: I understand what you want, but it will take me some time. Come back in a million years or so.</p> <p><i>The plants twiddle their thumbs for a million years.</i></p> <p><b>PC</b>: OK, a million years is up! Did you manage to discover something?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Yes, let me see, I think I have it in the drawer. Here it is: lignin.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: What’s lignin?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: It’s a rigid molecule made of carbon and hydrogen. If you absorb it into the cells of your body, it will interact with the molecules of floppy cellulose you already have, and this will create a very firm structure that will allow your cells to become like bricks. You can then stack one cell upon the other, and you can go as high as you want.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: How high?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Over 300 feet.</p> <p><b>PC</b>: Wow!</p> <p>So the plants happily swallowed the lignin, and sure enough, it worked exactly as Mr. R&amp;D said, and within a short time stalks, trunks, branches, roots, leaves began popping up all over the Earth.</p> <p>The only problem was that when one of these trees reached the end of its natural life, bacteria and fungal spores got ready to decompose it, sharpening their knives. But when they got to the lignin, their knives stuck: They couldn’t digest the lignin. The very thing that made lignin strong defeated the bacteria and fungi back then. So, they did what we do when we eat a chicken dinner: They ate all the meat and left the bones, which is to say: the lignin.</p><p>Eventually another tree would die and fall on top of the first, and then the same thing would happen again, and another and another, and it kept going like this for hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions of years. In the end, over 100 million years of dead trees and ferns and undigested lignin were deposited under the surface of the Earth. We call the time when most of this happened the Carboniferous (carbon-making) age.</p><figure data-alt="Murch_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/17341_c9dcf2529a5f4bf66234540fbe60b74e.png" alt="" width="733"><figcaption><span><strong>BUG OUT:</strong> Around 300 million years ago, there was so much oxygen that insects, who have inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies (seen here in a lifesize model in Italy) had a wingspan of about three feet.</span><span>life_in_a_pixel / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure><p>Remember how evolution sometimes has unforeseen consequences? Well, this deposit of lignin produced an oxygen surge in the atmosphere. Because for every hydrocarbon atom that goes into the Earth, an oxygen atom is not used up in the decay process. Massive amounts of carbon (lignin) were going into the Earth, so massive amounts of oxygen were building up in the atmosphere. Today, oxygen is 21 percent of the atmosphere. But around 300 million years ago, oxygen was well over 30 percent. There was so much oxygen that insects, who have very inefficient ways of breathing, were able to get huge. Dragonflies had a wingspan of three feet, millipedes were eight feet long. Amphibians—frogs and such—also have inefficient lungs, and they were able to get as big as dining room tables.<br></p><p>The microorganisms of the time eventually became aware of this surge in oxygen. The insects and the amphibians didn’t seem to care, because they were dependent on that rich source of oxygen. So the now-worried microorganisms got their committee (MC) together and went to see Mr. R&amp;D.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: Hello, what I can do for you?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: We think there is a dangerous situation developing, because oxygen levels have gotten higher every year and they might now be at 35 percent.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: So?</p> <p><b>MC</b>: With indigestible lignin, there is nothing to keep it from continuing to go up.</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: I see your point, because at 43 percent a lightning strike will cause the entire atmosphere to ignite since it is so high in flammable oxygen. And the whole experiment of life on Earth will be over. Yes, I agree we have to do something. Give me a million years and I’ll see what I can do.</p> <p><i>For a million years, oxygen levels continue to rise. The even more worried microorganisms come back to Mr. R&amp;D.</i></p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: The bad news is I don’t have anything physical to give you. But I can give you a koan.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: What’s that?</p> <p><b>Mr. R&amp;D</b>: A koan is something you can think of that will help you in …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> 
<p>Pijul for VS Code is an extension for Visual Studio Code which adds integration with Pijul as a source control management system.</p>
<p>Why develop my own extension instead of contributing to the existing one? It didn't even occur to me to check if one already existed
when I started, and when I did my own extension had enough distinct features to set it apart.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>At present, this extension offers <em>most</em> of the basic features necessary for local Pijul development on a single channel. It includes basic
commands for initializing a repository in a VS Code workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add, Reset, or Record one, some, or all of the files in the Pijul Repository.</li>
<li>Decorations in the file tree indicating the current state of each file.</li>
<li>VS Code comparison integration for diffing files with their last recorded versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else still needs to be done on the command line.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requires an existing Pijul installation. <a href="https://pijul.org/manual/installing.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instructions for installing Pijul can be found here</a>.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the Source Control View, deleted files show up as their parent directory (This is the result of a Pijul CLI limitation)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Pijul for VS Code hasn't been published on the extension marketplace yet, so it needs to be built and installed from the source.
To do so, folloow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Install Visual Studio Code Extensions (VSCE)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>npm install -g vsce
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Package the extension</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>vcse package
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P) and run the "Extensions: Install from VSIX..." to install the VSIX file you created in the last step </li>
</ol>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>With the eventual goal of releasing on the Extension Marketplace with the same level of quality as other source control extensions,
there are a number of areas which will require a great deal of further refinement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper handling of VS Code workspaces with multiple folders</li>
<li>Automatic detection of Pijul installations</li>
<li>More robust .ignore file handling</li>
<li>Greater configurability</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also a number of Pijul features which still need implementation to reach a publishable minimum viable product, suitable for local Pijul development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amending changes</li>
<li>Moving and removing files</li>
<li>Ignore file mangagement</li>
<li>Basic change log</li>
<li>Basic channel management</li>
</ul>
<p>In the long term, I would like to offer more in-depth Pijul integration, with the goal of providing a better experience than can be offered on the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote management</li>
<li>Inline <code>pijul credit</code> annotations</li>
<li>IntelliJ style changeset system</li>
<li>Splitting/Combining existing changes</li>
</ul>

<p>You know backups right? Those things you never got around to setting up… well no need to feel guilty any longer, today
I’m excited to share my new backup tool - <a href="https://bupstash.io/">Bupstash</a>!</p>
<p>So why is bupstash cool? Bupstash lets you make encrypted, deduplicated and secure backups.
Bupstash is fast, focused, and places strong emphasis on both security and privacy. Backups can happen to local drives or over ssh. Bupstash can backup files, directories, and even arbitrary command output.</p>
<p>Bupstash was designed to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficient deduplication - Bupstash can store hundreds of encrypted directory snapshots using a fraction of the space encrypted tarballs would require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offline decryption keys - Backups do not require the decryption key be anywhere near an at-risk server or computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key/value tagging with search - all while keeping the tags fully encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great performance on slow networks - Bupstash really strives to work well on high latency networks like cellular and connections to far-off lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure access controls - Ransomware and disgruntled business partners will be powerless to delete your backups, even after a
full system take over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient incremental backups - Bupstash knows what it backed up last time and skips that work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds great right? How does it work?</p>

<p>Bupstash stores data as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a> with encrypted root nodes. Each
time a file is saved, it is split into data chunks, which are
encrypted (using crypto_box_curve25519xchacha20poly1305 from <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a>) and then sent to or saved in the backup repository if they have never been seen before.</p>
<p>To identify encrypted chunks for deduplication, we use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> of the decrypted contents. The HMAC
key is a shared secret between the encryption key and the decryption key. This means
someone cannot guess a chunk’s contents based on the deduplication address in the backup
repository.</p>
<p>The end result is that many snapshots which share similar data also share encrypted chunks, resulting in very space-efficient backups. My personal backup repository
contains over 400 snapshots of my 40 GB home directory and weighs in at around 50 GB total.</p>

<p>In bupstash a key is either a ‘main key’ or a ‘put key’. Backups made by put keys can only be decrypted by the original
main key. With this setup, you can send backups to a bupstash repository without ever risking your decryption key.</p>
<p>You can imagine Bupstash’s model like when you send someone a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard">GPG</a>-encrypted email and you do not have access to their decryption key. Instead you use asymmetric cryptography and send data addressed
to their private key. Another benefit of the email-like model is that the email provider does not need access to your
decryption keys to store or forward your emails. Likewise, a remote bupstash repository never needs access
to your backup decryption keys to operate.</p>

<p>Bupstash maintains all backups in a mostly append-only log of encrypted backup metadata.
In order to allow searching that metadata, bupstash syncs the metadata log client-side before
performing decryption and searches client-side. This design sacrifices some performance for search and
listing in favour of fully encrypted metadata. In practice bupstash can easily search hundreds to thousands of snapshots
in seconds.</p>

<p>Bupstash focuses on backup and restore streaming, avoiding network round trips as much as possible.</p>
<p>When a user requests an encrypted snapshot, the
server walks the entire data structure server-side, and pushes
it to the client. The client then is able to verify the structure
and restore your data without any network round trips.</p>
<p>The bupstash <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/man/bupstash-gc.html">‘garbage collector’</a> works
entirely server-side and without requiring the server to decrypt any data, avoiding
sending data to the client in costly and slow ways.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? In some benchmarks restoring backups from a distant
remote server, I was able to achieve 6x performance improvements over the
previous backup tool I was using (benchmarks coming soon).</p>

<p>Bupstash is designed to allow the use of ssh force commands to control whether
an ssh key has permission to make new backups, list backups or remove backups.</p>
<p>In my personal backup setup, my laptop can only add new backups via a vpn, but never remove
old backups from my backup repository. If my laptop were to be stolen, all backups are
safe from deletion.</p>
<p>When bupstash is configured with append-only access controls, making a backup is analagous to sending someone an email,
the recipient of the message is the one who decides when the message can be deleted.</p>
<p>You can see how to set this up in the <a href="https://bupstash.io/doc/guides/Remote%20Access%20Controls.html">access controls tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Bupstash has the notion of a ‘send log’ for saving bandwidth and accelerating snapshot
speeds. Bupstash remembers which data chunks were
sent in the previous snapshot, allowing the client to avoid resending data pointlessly.</p>

<p>Below is a simple bupstash session:</p>
<pre><code>$ export BUPSTASH_REPOSITORY=ssh://bupstash.io/backups

$ bupstash put host="$(hostname)" name=home-backup.tar /home
ebb66f3baa5d432e9f9a28934888a23d

$ bupstash list host=$(hostname) and 'name=*.tar'
...
id="dbca49b072c0f94b9e72bf81e7716ff9" name="home-backup.tar" hostname="server1" timestamp="2020/08/03 15:47:32"

$ bupstash list-contents id="dbca*"
drwxr-xr-x 0     2020/10/30 13:32:04 .
-rw-r--r-- 1967  2020/10/30 13:32:04 data.txt
...

$ bupstash get id="dbca*" | tar -C ./restore -xvf -
...
$ bupstash get --pick data.txt id="dbca*"
data!

$ bupstash rm name=home-backup.tar and older-than 30d
$ bupstash gc

</code></pre><p>My goal with the bupstash user interface is letting people get on with their day
while having a simple and excellent backup insurance policy.</p>

<p>Bupstash is currently in alpha and ready for people to play with at their own
risk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Global Unique Identifiers</a> (GUIDs), also known as Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) can be used as practically unique identifiers in systems.</p><p>GUIDs have many advantages. You can safely generate identifiers in a distributed setting, compared to a central identifier registrar. Many systems are vulnerable to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor">Insecure Direct Object Reference</a> attacks, and even though permissions should always be checked for any access, it’s much easier to exploit these with sequential IDs compared to GUIDs (<a href="http://debarghyadas.com/writes/hacking-into-the-indian-education-system/">a high profile example</a>). Sequential IDs can leak <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14524061">important information</a>. Modern databases have custom <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-uuid.html">in-built</a> UUID types which have <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29882952/3399432">less storage overhead</a> and perform better than using a text type. There’s tons of <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">blogs</a> extolling the benefits of GUIDs.</p><p>But anecdotally, there’s too many cases where raw GUIDs are used as identifiers, even though they might not be the appropriate choice.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>By their nature, GUIDs are opaque values that don’t lend too much information about what they’re identifying. They’re also generally unergonomic due to their length and structure. It’s almost trivially obvious that GUIDs shouldn't be in URLs due to their <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?DontPutGuidsInUrls">poor aesthetics</a>. To steal an example from <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/primary-keys-ids-versus-guids/">Coding Horror</a>, database queries at the REPL can become frustrating.</p><pre><code>$ select * where userid='{BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10}'</code></pre><p>Poorly formatted log statements/errors can become harder to debug, since the identifiers don’t tell us what they’re identifying: </p><pre><code><code>error processing BAE7DF4-DDF-3RG-5TY3E3RF456AS10: nil</code></code></pre><p>This can be mitigated by having libraries that report stack traces/line numbers and help identify the exact line of code with the error, so in general, UUIDs often need context to aid debugging.</p><p>Moreover, the lack of type safety of using raw integers and raw UUIDs can cause <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2018/04/27/uid/">horrifying problems</a> and is emblematic of lack of type safety with identifiers. With poor naming in code, it’s very easy to cause problems. Consider a variation of the example from the linked blog:</p><pre><code>def get_team_and_user_ids() -&gt; List[Tuple[UUID, UUID]]:
  """Returns a tuple of (team_id, user_id) tuples"""
  ...

def ban(user_id: UUID) -&gt; None: ...

for (user, team) in get_team_and_user_ids():
    ban(user)</code></pre><p>The script might just error out since UUIDs between users and teams aren’t shared, but the consequences might have been worse with integer IDs.</p><h2>Designing your Identifiers</h2><p>Identifiers should be designed for the properties of object they’re going to be identifying. We can mix and match components based on the importance of mutability, debuggability, performance and privacy for the object. For example, identifiers for permanent or external objects like customers should be treated differently to ephemeral or internal objects like tasks/jobs.</p><p><strong>Structure identifiers with prefixes and hierarchies</strong></p><p>Often for internal objects, debuggability is key, and prefixes can help with debugging. For example, all task identifiers could have the prefix “task-”. This automatically makes context free debugging easier, and makes it easy to grep for all messages that have IDs:</p><pre><code>error processing task-2: nil</code></pre><p>Hierarchies help even more with debuggability. Let’s say that every “Job” spawns N “Tasks”. Tasks IDs might want to contain their job IDs, so that it becomes trivially simple to grep for tasks of a particular job. For example, a task ID would look like: `job-123-task-1`. This also helps in ad-hoc database queries to find relevant rows without complex JOINs. We have examples of this in real life, like area codes in phone numbers.</p><p>We can add constant prefixes/hierarchies to any existing ID type. Critics might point out that storing a prefix with a UUID is wasteful since we’d lose the benefits of database optimized UUID types. This can easily be mitigated by storing un-prefixed UUID in the database, and application code automatically prepends a prefix for client code to use, but this might add some complexity.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content Addressability</a></strong></p><p>Sometimes, we want a zero inconsistency approach to storing objects, so it might make sense to make the identifier (or part of it) the checksum of the content that is to be stored. This guarantees that the underlying content has not been modified. Git does this with SHA1 commit hashes (<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/">even though this is being migrated to SHA256 as of December 2020</a>). <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (build system) uses a Content Addressable Store for <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/remote-caching.html">remote caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Semi sortability</strong></p><p>If you need basic sortability and don’t mind the privacy concerns, consider using a scheme like Segment’s <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid">KSUID</a>. This side-steps use of sequential IDs which will be painful to migrate away from. <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/ksuid#2-collision-free-coordination-free-dependency-free">UUID1 has some known issues</a>.</p><h2>Type Safety</h2><p>At the very least, identifiers should not be allowed to float freely as strings or integers in order to prevent a class of inconsistency bugs. SQLAlchemy, a database manipulation library in Python, lets user implement a custom <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator">TypeDecorator</a> (and has native support for Postgres UUIDs). Let’s reproduce an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398042/3399432">example</a> with some tweaks:</p><pre><code>from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
import uuid
from typing import NewType

db = SQLAlchemy()

FooId = NewType("FooId", bound=UUID)

class Foo(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(FooId(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, 
                   default=uuid.uuid4, unique=True)</code></pre><p>With a custom type “FooId” being marked as the column type, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">type checking</a> will prevent other ID types or raw UUID types there.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’ve seen that there’s a fair amount of complexity involved in id management and decision making. Some high scale applications end up deploying <a href="https://code.flickr.net/2010/02/08/ticket-servers-distributed-unique-primary-keys-on-the-cheap/">custom ID generation</a> services. Identifiers are an early, hard to reverse decision that affect even schemaless datastores, so they’re worth thinking about in advance, and the right decision can compound developer productivity and prevent painful infrastructure migrations down the road.</p></div></div>]]>

        <section>
            <div><p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a solid remote access tool. IMO it's a key enabling technology for distributed systems. However it's effective security is not ideal. It's authentication scheme with RSA key pairs and wire-level encryption is great. But key management is tricky, and opening the firewall(s) for bidirectional SSH (port 22) increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>This article describes an AWS innovation introduced in 2019 called the session manager. Yes, you really can improve that mouse trap. The session manager adds to ssh a layer of authentication and authorization based on IAM and only requires HTTPS <em>outbound</em> on the server end. SSH rides on top of the Session Manager via SSH's proxy capability.</p>
<p>Now, remote host access might be on the wane. Cloud native is trending us towards managed platforms (cloud functions, serverless, container orchestrators), where it is discouraged, if not impossible, to start a shell. But for now, we still need it.</p>
<p>Let us level set first on SSH before we get into SSH proxied via the Session Manaager.</p>

<p>Straight, plain-vanilla SSH has a client and a server component, communicating over the SSH protocol. A shell session is initiated to a server-side user account, and authenticated either by a password or private key whose public key has been pre-authorized on the server:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-straight-ssh"></p>
<p>Note that ssh client is usually a bundle of tools: secure shell, file transfer and copy (ssh, sftp and scp). All three use the above architecture.</p>
<p>For reference, starting the session looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{public-ip-or-fqdn}
</code></pre>

<p>AWS offers session manager clients as part of the AWS CLI (with an add on) and the Console (Browser interface). The client and server communicate over HTTPS and secure web sockets, via the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) gateway:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-direct"></p>
<p>A few points to reemphasize here:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is effectively no risk of inbound attack. The firewall (security group and/or network acl) only needs an 443 outbound rule. The ssm agent on the EC2 Instances poll the gateway for session requests.</li>
<li>You can remove jumphosts altogether, or at least move them to private subnets. These instances need no public IP, and outbound access is enabled via a NAT gateway.</li>
<li>It's easier to harden authentication and manage credentials at scale. Console password rules (complexity, expiry), CLI access key rules (expiry) and use of MFA can be centralized. With AWS SSO or cross-account role assumption, each user has one set of credentials to use and rotate. Of course on and off-boarding is simplified as well.</li>
<li>You can more easily authorize access. SSH keys are often shared across hosts for convenience. IAM policies can be configured to limit access based on instance ids, tags, subnets, etc. on a per-user, per-role or per-group basis.</li>
<li>You can more easily audit access for forensics or integrate DevSecOps processes. Session lifecycle is logged in CloudTrail, and you can log to S3 the <em>full</em> shell history (both commands typed <em>and</em> responses displayed).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="iamuser">IAM User</h2>
<ol>
<li>An IAM policy. I like using to use this set:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:GetConnectionStatus",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:DescribeSessions",
                "ssm:StartSession",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceProperties"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerStartDescribe"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "ssm:TerminateSession"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:session/${aws:username}-*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "SessionManagerTerminate"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above allows a user to list all current and historical sessions. Last I checked (Nov 2019), you cannot restrict DescribeInstances to those started by the user, but it does fortunately restrict entry termination to those the user has started.</p>
<p>You have to choose between users being able to view all current sessions (but not enter or terminate them) and viewing none at all. Same for historical sessions.</p>
<h2 id="ec2instance">EC2 Instance</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An SSM agent. It's pre-installed with the Amazon Machine Images (AMI) for Windows Server, Ubuntu Server 16 and 18, Amazon Linux 1 and 2, and all the AL variants for Batch, ECS, ElasticBeanstalk, etc. However, it has taken AWS many months to roll out the latest agent that supports SSH Proxying. Last I checked (Nov 2020), Ubuntu 16 supports direct but not proxied ssh. (Run <code>snap refresh amazon-ssm-agent</code> in your user data or other bootstrap mechanism to update it.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM policy via an ec2 instance profile (role). The AWS doc on this is a little scattered. I like to use this set:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerCore"
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:ListInstanceAssociations",
                "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
        }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to log session data (shell history), you'll need another set of permissions, e.g. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html">documented here</a>.</p>
<p>Assign the profile (role) to the ec2 instance. If you assign the role after the instance started, bounce the ssm agent to get it connected to the backend.</p>

<p>Now let's bring in our trusty ssh, scp and sftp.</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh"></p>
<p>You can also use this approach for:</p>
<ol>
<li>custom users with non-default authorized ssh keys</li>
<li>custom users with password only authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>The proxy config for Linux (<code>~/.ssh/config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
</code></pre>
<p>For Windows/OpenSSH (<code>C:\Users\{username}\.ssh\config</code>):</p>
<pre><code># SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
  ProxyCommand C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters portNumber=%p"
</code></pre>
<p>If you have multiple aws profiles configured, export (set in Windows Powershell) the AWS_PROFILE variable prior to starting the session.</p>
<p>So now we can use the instance id, instead of the public ip or fqdn:</p>
<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-ec2-instance.pem ec2-user@{instance-id}
</code></pre>
<p>It will look and feel just like a straight ssh session. Occassionally starting the session takes a few seconds, but the performance from there on is just as good as ssh, in my experience.</p>
<p>All the other facilities, like scp and sftp, and remote execution of a command, are available as well. Also you can use the bundled ssh-add utility to store your keys in a cache and drop the -i option.</p>

<p>What about access to data stores, like private RDS or Elasticsearch/Kibana instance? You can use your client tools, like a MySQL Workbench in the case of RDS MySQL, or a browser in the case of Kibana. You connect them to a local port, e.g. 3306 or 8443, that is an open ssh tunnel riding on the session manager.</p>
<p>The following diagram depicts access from the MySQL CLI client to a MySQL RDS:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-proxied-ssh-tunnel-1"></p>

<p>You can amend the user policy to restrict access. My two favorites follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whitelist specific people in a common policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "SessionManagerDenyRestricted",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-0cdbc0106ed03bba5",
              "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/i-07e8b9fc88ee02bf8"
            ]
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:username": "first.last1",
                    "aws:username": "first.last2"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use a group or role reference.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Whitelist categories of instances in a user- or group-specific policy:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>        ...
        {
            "Sid": "StartSessionResourceTag",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ssm:StartSession",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "ssm:resourceTag/Purpose": "jumpbox"
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Of course you then have to restrict ec2 instance tag updates to admins.</p>
<p>Refer to these <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-restrict-access-quickstart.html">quick start policies</a> for more.</p>

<p>By default, all session start and end is logged to CloudTrail, like all AWS service activity. You could enable some DevSecOps process on using CloudWatch event rules, like looking for .</p>
<p>You can enable session data logging to an S3 bucket, but take care! The content is highly sensitive. For example, users may type passwords in shell command arguments and cat files with PHI data. Therefore the logs must be sent to a well guarded bucket, e.g. in an audit account that is only allowed temporarily access by forensics investigators.</p>

<p>Putting it all together:</p>
<p><img src="http://sawers.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1.png" alt="AWS-Session-Manager-Arch-system-1"></p>
<p>AWS Session Manager enables us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>harden our systems (reduce the attack surface, use multi-factor authentication and fine-grained authorization)</li>
<li>centralize identity and access management</li>
<li>centralize audit</li>
</ol>
<p>And all this with no degredation in the user experience.</p>
<p>IMO, it's a win-win for dev, ops and security teams.</p>

                    <p>To say I was a gamer in my teenage years is an understatement. However, the gaming scene today is vastly different, and it's clear from Twitch and YouTube gaming that people really enjoy watching others play. For me, gaming has always been about the stories and the worlds that provides an escape from the present world. Second to that, I enjoy conversing with friends about all things gaming.</p><p>I am an adult now with responsibilities towards work and family. My passion for games got lost along the way. People say, if you really are passionate, you will make time. This is true to a certain extent. Life isn't always that simple.</p><p>Anyway, earlier this year, I was searching for a place where the topic of conversation is gaming without the negativity of the real world. Three of us (similar age and jobs) found comfort in <a href="https://basecamp.com/personal">Basecamp Personal</a>. I take full credit for this idea and execution because when I initially suggested Basecamp; I was told, the last thing we need in our life is another corporate app. The idea is to escape work. It's all a matter of perspective, one needs to look at a software objectively and use it for your use case.</p><h2 id="what-is-basecamp">What is Basecamp?</h2><p>Well, in this case, it's a one-stop shop for all things gaming between close friends. <em>In the real world, Basecamp is a premier project management + internal communication tool for remote WFH teams worldwide.</em> With over 3.3 million Basecamp accounts created, it seems well regarded in the project management world etc. I am no expert, but I am responsible for 10 of the 3.3 million Basecamp accounts, and we do not use these for work or any revenue generating activities.</p><h2 id="why-basecamp-personal">Why Basecamp Personal?</h2><ul><li>Multi Platform — Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and any modern browser</li><li>Privacy focused</li><li>Free</li><li>Flexible and modular</li></ul><p>We all work in big corporations, and you wouldn't believe that most apps/services are blocked by our IT department. On the other hand, Basecamp works perfectly.</p><p>At first, we were cautious of using Basecamp for free because, as you know, nothing in life is free. If you do not pay financially, you will pay through sacrificing your privacy and/or data (🤔 Gmail, Facebook etc). Fortunately, <strong>some things in life are still free with no other costs, and Basecamp Personal is a delightful example of this.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="how-we-use-basecamp">How we use Basecamp?</h2><p><em>Note: My friends were not keen on making our Basecamp setup public, so I attempted to recreate it and basing the characters in this story on David and Jason (<strong>for light-hearted fun only</strong>) to give you an example of how we use Basecamp Personal.</em></p><p><em>The ease of account creation is the single most reason I attempted to recreate our Basecamp setup. In addition, Basecamp only asked for my name and email address. Nothing else! No credit cards, no secret questions, no personally identifiable information. <strong>It's actually nice to have your privacy respected. A strange feeling.</strong></em></p><p>Basecamp is our safe place where we discuss, plan and have fun with gaming. Basecamp is very modular and therefore allows us to turn off any “tools” (features) that are irrelevant. We disabled:</p><ul><li>Message Board</li><li>To-dos</li><li>Email forwards</li><li>Automatic check-ins</li></ul><p>I also appreciated the option to re-arrange the tools, allowing me to put Campfire (most used) on the top left etc.</p><figure><img src="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1000w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_0216.jpeg 1919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>GAMING HUB</figcaption></figure><p>This leaves us with a very custom setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Docs &amp; Files:</strong> starter guides, books, cheat sheets, maps, etc</li></ul><figure><img src="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png" alt="" srcset="https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1000w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1600w, https://merecivilian.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-29-at-8.25.42-pm.png 1604w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><ul><li><strong>Campfire:</strong> lively discussions on gaming, sharing screenshots, betting on when Cyberpunk will come out.

Thankfully, Basecamp<a href="https://3.basecamp-help.com/article/86-how-notifications-work"> offers in-depth control of notifications</a> to your liking.</p><hr><h2 id="perfect-use-case-example-">Perfect USE CASE Example:</h2><p>Recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a> was released and in our childhood, we had spent hours if not days playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streets_of_Rage">Streets of Rage series</a>. Replaying this together again in our adulthood, resurfaced memories of the time when all we did was enjoy and have fun in each other’s company through our passion for gaming.</p><p>Using Basecamp, we organised when we will play online, our respective characters and argued over who will pick which character. We also discussed our childhood memories. It’s fascinating because each of us vividly remembered stories that the others had forgotten. We shared Easter eggs we found. The music and the overall feel of the game is an enormous walk down nostalgia street.</p><h2 id="basecamp-for-task-management">Basecamp for Task Management</h2><p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things by Culture Code</a> is my task management app of choice and has been for over 2 years now. As much as I enjoy using Things, it bugs me that I cannot use it at work (Windows) and cannot attach files to my tasks. I actually tried to move to Basecamp for all things task management but the limitation of 3 projects (5 would be ideal) and lack of repeating tasks was a dealbreaker and the paid up version is $99 a month which is out of the question for me.</p><p>I will say this, if it suits your workflow, Basecamp Personal is excellent for personal task management. It's extremely flexible, intuitive, collaborative (up to 20 users), well designed and a very reliable service.</p><p>Considering how unreliable our current corporate solution is, I pitched Basecamp to my organisation’s IT head. It’s likely this will gain any traction as changing software for an organisation of 30,000 people is no easy task.</p><p>My intention behind this post is to demonstrate the importance of having an open mind and think outside the box, thus allowing you to objectively evaluative the best use of tools in your arsenal. Basecamp is viewed as a business software solution. However, it's clear from my use case, that one shouldn't pigeonhole software into categories.</p><h5 id="my-heartfelt-thanks-to-the-entire-team-of-basecamp-and-the-founders-for-providing-basecamp-personal-free-of-charge">My heartfelt thanks to the entire team of Basecamp and the founders for providing Basecamp Personal free of charge</h5>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>2020 was my second full year running <a href="https://alchemist.camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alchemist Camp</a> as a screencasting business, and it enjoyed some growth. Looking at my dashboards, it's fallen short of the <a href="https://questinglog.com/2019-year-in-review">goals I set last year</a>, but it's still considerable progress given all that's happened.
<small>(Disclaimer: These numbers haven't been audited and are simply what I've pulled from various accounts and spreadsheets. The year isn't quite over, either)</small></p> <p>Alchemist Camp is a site with many screencasts for programmers learning Elixir. Most of them are free and on <a href="https://youtube.com/alchemistcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, but many are restricted to paying subscribers. I've also launched a couple of adjacent products.</p> <h2 id="_2020-goals-recap"><a href="#_2020-goals-recap">#</a> 2020 goals recap</h2> <p>I had set four goals for 2020:</p> <ol><li>Double gross subscription sales to $28k</li> <li>Keep lifetime retention above 60%</li> <li>Launch the second product I've been working on before the first of March</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference</li></ol> <p><strong>#1 (miss)</strong>: Growth has been very slow since March.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/growth-chart-2020.d126cd0d.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p><strong>#2 (barely)</strong>: Retention of existing subscribers was decent, and barely cleared goal #2 as long as people who subscribed and churned multiple times only count as a single churn.</p> <p><strong>#3 (hit)</strong>: I got a 2nd product launched by March! It was the <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit</a> I'd already announced would be a freebie for my existing Alchemist Camp subscribers last Black Friday.</p> <p><strong>#4 (miss)</strong>: I've been in Taiwan all year since arriving from Japan at the end of February and wasn't able to make it to an Elixir conference in the US. I won't count this one due to the pandemic.</p> <h2 id="new-products"><a href="#new-products">#</a> New products</h2> <p>I released two new products this year, both for Elixir devs.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter"><a href="#phoenix-igniter">#</a> Phoenix Igniter</h3> <p>Phoenix Igniter is a <a href="https://phoenixigniter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starter kit for building Phoenix apps</a> that includes various boilerplate code I've found myself writing repeatedly across projects. It's in beta, and is useful for me but I'm having a hard time getting any user feedback.</p> <p>Thus far, it's been entirely driven by what I want on my own projects. It's a one-time purchase product, so sales are very spikey. I gave it away to every Alchemist Camp subscriber during Black Friday of 2019, so there are considerably more users than paying customers.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/igniter-chart-2020.21f716f4.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>I have high hopes for Igniter. Ultimately, I can see it appealing to a much broader group of devs than my screencast subscriptions on Alchemist Camp can.</p> <h3 id="_5-little-potions"><a href="#_5-little-potions">#</a> 5 Little Potions</h3> <p>5 Little Potions is an <a href="https://alchemist.camp/little-potions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ebook for beginner Elixir learners</a> and I'm currently about 45% of the way writing it. I had a few goals in starting this book. First of all, I wanted to have something substantial for beginners. About the first 15 screencasts or so I did for Alchemist Camp are aimed at beginners, but the last 150+ have been aimed more at peers and people digging into specific topics.</p> <p>I also felt like coding some games instead of just business-focused web apps!</p> <p>It hasn't brought in a lot of revenue, due to the low price, but I think it's a great way to reach more learners. As I finish the 3rd, 4th and 5th games in the book and get ready for its launch, I expect to see quite a few more people buy.</p> <p><img src="https://questinglog.com/assets/img/potions-chart-2020.fe47bae1.png#bordered#centered" alt="growth chart"></p> <p>Okay! Let's have a look at the stats...</p> <h2 id="financial-stats"><a href="#financial-stats">#</a> Financial stats</h2> <h3 id="alchemist-camp"><a href="#alchemist-camp">#</a> Alchemist Camp</h3> <ul><li>Alchemist Camp revenue: $18,846.63 (+35%)</li> <li>Wage per hour: ~$38 (+52%)</li> <li>Paying subscribers: 96 current</li> <li>Lifetime retention: 60%</li> <li>Expenses: $4901.56 (-1%)</li> <li><strong>Profits: $13,945.07 (+55%)</strong></li></ul> <h3 id="expenses-breakdown"><a href="#expenses-breakdown">#</a> Expenses Breakdown</h3> <ul><li>Stripe: $2,295.98</li> <li>ConvertKit: $441</li> <li>Digital Ocean: $316.86</li> <li>Domain names: $120</li> <li><strong>Services Total: $3,222.84</strong></li> <li>Technical books: $724.15 (Mostly Manning, Pragprog and No Starch Press)</li> <li>Screencasts and courses: $954.57 (about 50/50 business and technical)</li> <li><strong>Educational Total: $1,678.72</strong></li></ul> <p>This year's expenses ended up almost identical to last year. However the breakdown is very different. Stripe cost considerably more, due to a combination of higher volume, increased fees and using more services. In particular, Stripe moved its customers from Subscriptions (for which I was a free forever plan) to Billing, which has a percentage fee on every transaction.</p> <p>Another major cost increase was due to my moving from Mail Chimp to ConvertKit. I was spending $49/month for marketing email services for most of the year. It wasn't worth it for me in the end, so I migrated to SendFox.</p> <p>My educational spending was less than half what it was last year. That's not because I'm any less of a believer in investing in it, but mostly due to being behind my revenue goals and finding better bargains.</p> <h3 id="phoenix-igniter-starter-kit"><a href="#phoenix-igniter-starter-kit">#</a> Phoenix Igniter (starter kit)</h3> <ul><li>Phoenix Igniter revenue: $1,140</li> <li>Stripe fees: $44.16</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,095.84</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-little-potions-ebook"><a href="#_5-little-potions-ebook">#</a> 5 Little Potions (ebook)</h3> <ul><li>5 Little Potions revenue: $1,575</li> <li>Gumroad fees: $129</li> <li><strong>Profits</strong>: $1,446</li></ul>  <ul><li>YouTube Views: 77.7k (+26%)</li> <li>Monthly Unique Visitors: ~12k (excluding bots)</li> <li>Accounts created (all time): 4705</li></ul> <h2 id="big-wins"><a href="#big-wins">#</a> Big wins</h2> <ol><li>My RSI is nearly healed!</li> <li>Podcasting with Justin Vincent</li> <li>Overcoming crazy obstacles</li> <li>The idea muscle</li> <li>Doubling down on learning</li></ol> <h3 id="healing-wrists"><a href="#healing-wrists">#</a> Healing wrists</h3> <p>Three years and a month ago, I could barely use a phone or mouse at all. It hurt just to brush my teeth. I had <em>severe</em> repetitive stress injuries and was in a pretty bad bind.</p> <p>Even <a href="http://localhost:8080/2020-year-in-review/#wrists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>, I was still far from better. It's a big part of why I've put so much time into reading, podcasting and other hands-free activities the past couple of years.</p> <p>But now, I'm finally feeling about 90%. I still do stretches and still do 100% of my computing from an ergonomic keyboard (or iPad + pencil), but I can actually bang out an 8-hour day of coding and typical computer use and feel okay the next day. I'm not pushing it, but I'm <em>thrilled</em> about the improvement!</p> <h3 id="the-reactor-am-podcast"><a href="#the-reactor-am-podcast">#</a> The Reactor.am podcast</h3> <p>The level of serendipity I experience in my life sometimes astounds me and this is one of those cases. In my yearly review last year, I wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>But then this spring, a funny thing happened. I got sucked into this long-running podcast called <a href="http://techzinglive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techzing</a> and started listening to the archives (which go back ten years) and I heard some interviews they did with Amy Hoy.</p></blockquote> <p>Well, things have progressed. I just finished recording the 44th episode of <a href="https://reactor.am/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactor.am</a>, a mastermind-based podcast a few hours ago. My co-host is Justin Vincent—one of the two co-hosts of Techzing. He's got far, far more entrepreneurial experience than I do and it's been a good learning experience.</p> <p>This certainly wasn't remotely a goal or something that even seemed within the realm of possibility a year ago, but it's been great! If we're living in a simulation, I'm pretty sure I'm a player character 😎</p> <h3 id="overcoming-crazy-obstacles"><a href="#overcoming-crazy-obstacles">#</a> Overcoming crazy obstacles</h3> <p>I was in Taiwan on a 90 day visa-free entry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PPfl4XRxh4&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when borders started closing</a> due to the pandemic and managed to get an entrepreneur visa good for a year.</p> <p>Then later in the spring, my bank closed my account and disabled my debit card due to an error, while I was abroad... in the middle of the pandemic. That was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxCra7EaPQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly a crisis</a> since 100% of my income flows through the account and I needed things like food, housing and water.</p> <p>But, I managed to hustle and overcome both obstacles mostly intact. All I lost was some sleep and some time. All-in-all, that's not bad for 2020.</p> <h3 id="the-idea-muscle"><a href="#the-idea-muscle">#</a> The idea muscle</h3> <p>I've been religiously sticking to James Altucher's <em>Idea Muscle</em> practice, picking a topic and generating at least 10 ideas every day. It seems like a small thing, but after a month or two, I really started feeling a difference. I attribute both the book I'm currently writing and my increased screencasting productivity to it.</p> <p>I've been doing all of it on an iPad and just using Apple notes with the pencil and it's been just as good in terms of writing, thinking and processing as a paper and pencil were last time I tried this but it's easier to save and review them.</p> <h3 id="doubling-down-on-learning"><a href="#doubling-down-on-learning">#</a> Doubling down on learning</h3> <p>I've continued aggressively trying to deepen my technical skills while picking up some new ones that will help me make progress as a founder. Humble Bundles and ebook purchases in general have been paying off the most.</p> <p>One great thing I've realized is that an iPad + pen is a near ideal tool for active reading. I can fearlessly highlight the heck out of any book I read and later erase any highlights I don't want to keep.</p> <h2 id="what-didn-t-go-so-well"><a href="#what-didn-t-go-so-well">#</a> What didn't go so well</h2> <ol><li>Growth</li> <li>Decision paralysis</li></ol> <h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth">#</a> Growth</h3> <p>My audience is growing just as slow as it was a year ago. I noted an increase in competition in the market then and it seems to have continued, likely in part due to the pandemic.</p> <p>At that time, I wasn't too concerned and saw such competition as likely to grow the market overall and mostly have little effect on me. Now I'm not so sure.</p> <p>Elixir is a <em>tiny</em> market, and I'm seeing the low-end of it getting flooded with new courses while the total number of people learning it or using at work is fairly flat.</p> <p>This is part of why I've broadened my business into adjacent territory with the book and the starter kit and why I'm looking at still other opportunities involving software as opposed to educational products.</p> <h3 id="decision-paralysis"><a href="#decision-paralysis">#</a> Decision paralysis</h3> <p>I know I can make faster progress than I have so far, but it's <em>very</em> difficult to evaluate what business efforts are worth investing time into.</p> <p>I'm currently evaluating a <em>lot</em> of options, including finding contract work and investing money as well as time into a project.</p> <br>   <br> <h2 id="goals-for-2021"><a href="#goals-for-2021">#</a> Goals for 2021</h2> <ol><li>Break $75k total revenue</li> <li>Launch a SaaS product, likely a micro-SaaS</li> <li>Find a banking setup I can rely on while living outside the US</li> <li>Finally travel to the US for an Elixir conference???</li> <li>Grow sales in all three existing products</li></ol> <p>Despite everything, I'm feeling even more confident this year than I did last year. I may experience some pain revolving around banking and residency status again, but I'll find my way through it and keep investing in the long-term.</p> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25587873" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion on HN</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Traditionally at the year end I like to note most significant trends that I see unfolding in the DevOps world. I did not know about the level of disruption that Covid would cause when I put “Remote Asynchronous Workforce” on the <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/01/04/devops-2020-tectonic-shift/">last year’s list</a>. As we now know this actually turned out to be the #1 trend of 2020, which to me actually was the brightest spot of the otherwise grim year.</p>



<p>Now, going to 2021 here are the trends that I would like to highlight:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Bundles and Software Bills of Materials.</strong> The industry is actively looking to automate push-button deployments but at the same time preserving transparency and traceability of software components. From the one side we want a black box with the whole suite of what we are deploying. From the other side we want to be able to quickly replace a component which security or stability was compromised. That’s why bundles are so important. Read more about bundles in my recent post <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/11/15/devops-bundles-new-name-of-the-game/">here</a>.<br></li><li><strong>Complexity vs Simplicity paradox.</strong> Business wants simplicity and quick roll-outs of ad-hoc software components. To achieve that they are actively looking at so-called “no-code” or “low-code” tools. Similarly, in DevOps world “Serverless” or “No-Ops” tools become increasingly popular. At the same time, this approach creates a huge scalability gap between initial prototyping and production deployments. This problem is only starting to unfold and I expect we would be hearing more about it in 2021.<br></li><li><strong>Vertical integration in DevOps vs “Best Tool for the Job”.</strong> Philosophy of DevOps tooling is currently split between companies like GitLab who are pushing for single suite of tools to handle all your DevOps needs and many others who build specialized tools which do better job in their niches. I wrote a post about this some time ago <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/03/20/lego-world-no-1-devops-solution-fits-all/">here</a>. What I currently observe is increased marketing effort from companies advocating vertical integration to gain market share. I believe in the end of a day this is harmful to the overall software quality and that the “Best Tool for the Job” approach would be the preferred one. But in any case it would be interesting to observe the community reaction to this marketing push.<br></li><li><strong>Widening gap between high performers and low performers.</strong> Not sure if this will happen in 2021 or a little later, but there is a growing sense of urgency for low performers to do better or be wiped out by competition. Essentially, the trend we are waiting for is mass migration of low performers (in DevOps terms) to modern tooling and modern philosophies. This creates massive challenge and massive opportunity at the same time for DevOps practitioners.<br></li><li><strong>Kanban.</strong> Kanban is often more appropriate than Scrum for DevOps-oriented organizations. Still, the adoption level of Kanban remains sub-par to that of Scrum. However, I see the trend that this is changing. People enjoy Kanban boards and gradually move to adopt wider Kanban principles (starting with things like WIP-limits).<br></li><li><strong>CI is the new Version Control – CD will come next. </strong>These days it is hard to imagine a software project without version control. And starting one is as simple as typing “git init”. Now with Dockerfile, Continuous Integration piece is not much harder. So essentially, every piece of software now relies on working Version Control <strong>and </strong>its Continuous Integration pipeline. These are pretty much 2 things you do right away when you start a software project. And I believe this trend will be solidified in 2021. Continuous Delivery would come later, but it will come inevitably. See my post on <a href="https://worklifenotes.com/2020/06/04/7-best-practices-modern-cicd/">best CI/CD practices</a> for more details on the current state of things.</li></ol>



<p>I believe these are the most important trends that are happening right now in the DevOps world. Happy 2021, I truly hope it would be much happier than 2020!</p>

<p>It all started at my first job. I’ve been around 6 months in the company and was happy getting used to the ropes of my current job. In those 6 months, I quickly pushed to prod (without even knowing it) and was learning very fast. I still remember when my boss called me to his office: We are going to do some changes and you’ll lead this new 3 person team. I thought to myself: Cool, I’ve learned some books about leadership, this could be fun.</p>



<p>The tricky part was the members of the team. They were a couple of technicians who had more than ten years on the job and more than twenty years in the company ( I was twenty years old). One of them was even a team lead recently. I did not understand the mechanics of that re-org at the time and still don’t have all the information about what was happening. I wish I had some cool story about why I was chosen to lead the team, really don’t know.</p>



<p>It was not a walk in the park, things started to get ugly before they could get better. As expected they pushed back a lot, they did not like the change, me, or anything that was happening. It’s funny, looking back I think my ego should have been hurt based on all the times they tried to avoid working with me and change things. I guess I was so confused with everything that I had no time for that.</p>



<p>When we started to work together, one thing was clear: they were not in the mood to take orders from a kid. I was not in the mood to give orders to them. This particular situation helped me a lot and shaped the way I work ten years later.</p>



<p>Given that it was almost impossible to give orders and avoid starting a world war. I started listening, that’s what I did the most in the first weeks. I listened and asked questions. Not like interrogations, more like curious questions. I think the key to the questions what that I wanted to learn from them. I was not a trick, I was very interested in what they were doing.</p>



<p>I still remember some kind of pranks they pulled on me. They would tell me they had run out of a particular material they needed. I had made a lot of calls and research to try to find it for them, then they magically found some in the warehouse or the car they used. I did not know these were pranks, I learned later when they had another team lead (I laughed that time).</p>



<p>With some retrospective, I think these pranks were not just to pick on the new guy. I think they were testing me. They wanted to see what I did, would I forget about the problem, slack off, blame it on them, or take ownership and be part of the team. Most of the time I came with solutions and discussed alternatives with the team. Some weeks later I think they started to trust me.</p>



<p>There was a point where I started to notice that I could help with some things. Not so much in executing, but there were some things they needed help with. Mostly operational excellence. They were relieved to have someone handle that. Every week we were becoming a better team.</p>



<p>Patience was a foundation for this team. At least from my side. I did not rush things out (I was not even sure how to do that) and never try to impose my ideas or way of working. I trusted a lot the team and things started to look better.</p>



<p>Not everything was perfect. We had disagreements and sometimes we preferred different approaches. This is normal in all teams, the good part is that we started to have a process. We had a daily meeting, talked about what we needed to do that day and we talked briefly at the end of the day. Every side learned to cede sometimes and when months have passed we were playing by ear.</p>



<p>Even though we were a productive team and technically very respected, what I always treasure from these experiences is human relationships. I still have a great time whenever I talk to these two people and we have a blast remembering the good old days. Based on what they say, they learn a thing or two from me, but I learned a ton from them and that experience.</p>

<p>They are more accurate than complicated devices in the laboratory, they know “something is wrong” faster and cannot be fooled.  In Poznań, mussels have been keeping water purity for 26 years.  The TVN24 reporter checked what exactly their “work” is all about and whether the inconspicuous barks have raised the alarm. </p>
<p><span>In Poznań, 26 years ago, mussels were “employed” to check the safety of water, and more specifically large ones.  The capital of Greater Poland was the first Polish city to decide on such a solution. </span></p>
<p><span>– Working as a microbiologist, I always thought to introduce a system that would work independently and would be based on living organisms.  The idea was for such a system to give us information about the quality of the water.  When looking at chemical tests, you can check a lot of things, but for each type of test you need a separate device – says Grzegorz Podolski, senior technologist for water quality at Aquanet. </span></p>

</p><p><span>It is different with biomonitoring.  – Here one organism, in this case a clam, checks many parameters and if there is any chemical contamination, it lets you know.  And that’s enough to take a sample, take it to the laboratory and see what it is about: confirm or deny that something is happening to the water.  It is a system that ensures safety against pollution and even terrorist activities.  The work of the mussels is closely related to what the laboratory does, adds Podolski. </span></p>
</div>
<h2>Work for two months </h2>

<p><span>Clams nourish themselves by filtering the water.  They are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution and much more than humans.  That is why they belong to the indicators, i.e. species of plants and animals that have a low degree of tolerance to changes in conditions in the environment in which they live. </span></p>
<p><span>How many mussels were given a “job” and how long they can work was checked and described in the instruction by scientists from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.  – We have three measuring devices in the company and eight clams in each.  In total, we “employ” 200 individuals during the year – says Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Within an hour, one individual can filter 1.5 liters of water.  – It is a good cooperation.  We have full democracy and gender equality here, because we have both male and female individuals – says Dorota Wiśniewska, spokesman for Aquanet SA in Poznań. </span></p>
<p><span>Each clam is first prepared and fed.  Then it goes to a special flow-through aquarium.  And there, for two months, they are on “duty”.  – This is the time when he can work and live safely.  Then the “workers” return to their natural environment, that is, to water reservoirs – explains Wiśniewska. </span></p>

<h2>They filter and alarm </h2>

<p><span>Biomonitoring based on mussels consists in constant, round-the-clock observation and registration of their shell movements.  How it’s working? </span></p>
<p><span>– Mussels open the shells and every now and then take in a small amount of water, filtering out everything that is suitable for eating.  When the water is polluted, they do their best to separate from it, and everyone’s shells just close at the same time.  This happens within two minutes.  If two or three clams close, it doesn’t have to mean anything, but if there are eight, it’s an alarm.  Then our role is to find out what has upset them so much and find out if it is a real or a false alarm – says Podolski. </span></p>

<p><span>– Have they all shut down?  – the TVN24 reporter asks. </span></p>
<p><span>– There has not been such a situation for these 26 years.  The water that goes to the mussels is of very good quality – adds Podolski. </span></p>
<p><span>Scientists have translated these clam responses into ‘computer language’.  – The mussels are glued to the plastic pedestal.  In addition, a magnet disc is glued to the shell, and a probe is mounted nearby that detects changes in the magnetic field.  When the clam closes or opens, it touches the probe with this magnet.  And we translate it into an image of the degree of opening and closing – explains the Aquanet employee.  </span></p>

<p><span>– During these 26 years, when we talk about the work of mussels during “open doors” or educational lessons, they always arouse positive emotions and great interest.  Visitors are always surprised that such small creatures play such an important role – adds Wiśniewska. </span></p>

So, I wanted to attempt to derive a learning progression for developers.</p><p>At each level of development, I recommend a few books. Each book hopefully is a thread you can pull on, if you want to go deeper into a particular topic.The book recommendations are subjective, but I believe that one can chart their own curriculum following the basic model. The recommendations that I make are just based on my own experience and aim to serve merely as guidance.</p><p>When it comes to progression to the next level, my general advice would be to master the level you are operating on and then aim to understand whats needed to operate at the next level.</p><p><strong>Completely Clockwork</strong></p><p>At this level most of the work is involved in making changes in a single service or component. This is where most of the <em>‘coding’</em> happens. The amount of time that will be spent reading your code will be multiples of the amount you would take to write it. You will work more with existing code rather than writing new code. A corollary of this fact is that you need to know how to make your code easy to change.So your focus should be on writing readable code and making it easy to change. </p><p>Your scope of work will probably within your team and its very likely that your circle of influence, impact and visibility would mostly be your team as well. The abstraction at which you operate in is your team. </p><p>The advice I would give at this level is to optimise for seeing problems solved through different <a href="https://charity.wtf/2020/11/01/questionable-advice-the-trap-of-the-premature-senior/">reference points</a>. </p><p>My recommendations for this level would be:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rDymed">Refactoring</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2L4q3HJ">Clean Architecture</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Somewhat Clockwork</strong></p><p>As you begin to build familiarity and also gain experience, you might see that increasingly you begin to look outward from the immediate scope of your team. You begin to try to understand how the surroundings affect the goals of your teams.  You start going on <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/surviving-the-organisational-side-quest">organisational side quests</a> to achieve your team’s goals. The abstraction at which you operate is still typically your team but the way you look at things becomes more outward looking.</p><p>In modern software development, distributed systems are ubiquitous. Even when you are making a change to a single service, that service most likely lives in an ecosystem of other services and a plethora of other distributed tools. As you grow in seniority you need to understand how best to interact with other services  and also the tradeoffs involved with each tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3rFMkfH">Designing Data Intensive Applications&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o1QDjf">Building Microservices</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Somewhat Complex</strong></p><p>As you gain more experience, you would have ideally developed some <a href="https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/08/31/on-touching-candles.html">calluses</a>, had a ring side view of  some <a href="https://twitter.com/StanTwinB/status/1336890442768547845">heart stopping close shaves</a>. This will prepare you to operate at next abstraction: teams of teams.  You would be advising on how to organise software and teams best to make teams successful in aggregate. You could be either leading <a href="https://lethain.com/migrations/">migrations to address technical debt</a> or <a href="https://lethain.com/reclaim-unreasonable-software/">reclaiming unreasonable software</a>. It will also probably be your call as to when to do what.</p><p>A practitioner operating mostly at this level needs to be able to use models to explain the  overall system or domain they are operating in and its interactions with its neighbouring domains. These models are not just to explain the software system but also the teams that surround that software. You need to understand the best models for organising teams to drive maximum impact. Additionally, as the operator of <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">complex systems</a> they wear two hats : that of the producer and that of the protector against failure. The practitioner needs to be able to handle this duality well.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eAl7">Domain Driven Design</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3o2KenM">Team Topologies</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3mYTWpZ">SRE Book&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/381eWrX">Accelerate&nbsp;</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>Completely Complex</strong></p><p>The abstraction that you operate in now is the entire organisation or in bigger companies, an entire division or department. Your focus is primarily on what to build rather than the how.  You will be doing a lot of writing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6530173230102122496/">since you need to communicate at scale</a>.</p><p>According to the paper, a completely complex system is a dynamic process, which is constantly in a state of flux. Any patterns here are emergent. Changes have both short term and long term repercussions. You also realise that the system is self organised for the most part. This sounds a lot like the modern organisation. At this scope you are typically operating as the technical leadership. You need to be able to form technical strategies grounded in the needs of the business.&nbsp;</p><p>Books for this level</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">Wardley Maps</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://amzn.to/38Msirg">Enterprise Architecture as Strategy</a></p></li></ul><p>So to summarise, this is what we end up with as a progression plan for developers over varying degrees of complexity.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3051da8e-aaca-477b-93d1-96e243d91b22_3846x1168.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:172810,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>There is a pithy saying - “<em><strong>All models are wrong, some are useful</strong></em>.” The model I have described here is not perfect.

</p>


<p>
Well, I'm finally bringing this series back from a months-long hiatus! In the
<a href="https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-2.txt.html">last post</a>, we started implementing an
emulator for a simple instruction set of our own. We sketched out the overall
architecture, and implemented a few instructions for moving data between virtual
registers and memory, learning about the corresponding x86-64 instructions
along the way. In this one, I want to focus on arithmetic and logic operations,
which will allow our emulator to do stuff that is a bit more interesting than
just moving bytes around. But before we jump into that, I want to briefly talk 
about how numbers are represented in a computer.
</p>

<h2>Number Representation</h2>

<p>
If you've made it this far in the tutorial, chances are that you understand the
basics of how the binary notation for numbers works, and don't need an
explanation of what bits and bytes are. So I'm not going to spend time on that.
</p>

<p>
However, there are some particular details related to representing signed
integers. Theoretically, this topic should be a part of any computer
science curriculum. But not every coder has a formal CS background, and even
among those that do, most either don't remember or have never encountered
these things in practice - because one simply doesn't have to think about them
for the vast majority of time when programming computers.
</p>

<p>
But number representation <i>is</i> important for understanding the arithmetic
instructions that we're going to be looking at; therefore, I feel like I can't
simply gloss over the topic.
</p>

<p>
If you already know how signed integers work in most computers, this might be a
good refresher, otherwise you might learn something new!
</p>

<h2>Representing Integers</h2>

<p>
Computers can't represent "numbers" in the abstract, mathematical sense.
They're finite, discrete machines and there's not enough memory in the world to
store a representation of an arbitrarily large quanitity, or even the
representation of a rather small, but "weird" quantity like
<a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">tau</a>.
</p>

<p>
We cope with that limitation by conceding that we'll never be able to represent
an arbitrary number. Instead, we use the resources at our disposal to represent
a subset of all numbers. We look at all the bit strings of a fixed
length, and agree that each of them represents a particular number.
However many different bit strings we can deal with, that's how many different
numbers we can represent.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can represent 256 distinct numbers using 8 bits, because there
are 256 different bit strings of length 8. Generally speaking, it is entirely up
to our interpretation <i>which</i> 256 numbers these strings represent.
For example, you could decide to interpret each of the 8 bits as a binary digit,
so that the entire 8-bit bitstring is nothing more than its corresponding
number, written out using the binary numeral system. On the other hand, you
might decide that the first 6 bits specify the "whole" part of the number, and
the remaining 2 bits specify the "fractional" part (this is called fixed-point
representation and used to be commonplace before the wide spread of
hardware-accelerated floating point arithmetic). It all depends on which subset
of numbers interests you at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
Certain instructions of a given processor have baked-in assumptions about the
representation used by their parameters, and behave accordingly. For example,
the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/addps">addps</a> SSE instruction
assumes that its parameters are floating point numbers adhering to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard. We're
more interested in instructions doing simple integer arithmetic, but those also
assume a certain representation, as we're about to see.
</p>

<p>
Let's have a look at some of the possible ways to represent integers in a
computer. For the sake of simplicity and readability, I am going to use eight
bits for everything, but all of this extends to a larger number of bits in a
straightforward manner.
</p>

<p>
In case of positive integers, the simple and straightforward mapping is to
just use a given integer's binary representation, as we've mentioned before.
If the representation doesn't take all of the available eight bits, we'll pad
out the number with zeroes from the left (the additional whitespace in the
middle of the bit string is added just for readability):
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>2</td><td>10</td><td>0000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>3</td><td>11</td><td>0000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>4</td><td>100</td><td>0000 0100</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
So far, so good. But things start to get sticky when we introduce negative
numbers into the mix. How would you represent a number like -5? Sure, if you
were doing math with a pencil and a piece of paper, you could just write "-101"
instead of "-5" and be done with it, but you can't exactly do that with a
computer.
</p>

<p>
The initial instinct might be to use the leftmost (most significant) bit to
indicate the sign. If the very first bit of a bit string is 0, then we assume the number to be
positive. If it is 1, we assume the number to be negative.
This way of coding signed numbers is called "sign-and-magnitude representation"
and it was used in some very old machines.
</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
 <td>Decimal<br>number</td><td>Binary<br>number</td><td>Bit<br>string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-3</td><td>-11</td><td>1000 0011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-2</td><td>-10</td><td>1000 0010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>-1</td><td>-1</td><td>1000 0001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>0000 0000</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Astute readers might have noticed an interesting problem here.
We've assigned the string "0000 0000" to 0, but how are we to interpret the
string 1000&nbsp;0000? It's -0, so the effective value it represents is just 0.
It looks like we ended up with two representations for a zero - one "positive"
and one "negative".
</p>

<p>
While having two representations for the same number is kind of ugly, it's
actually the least of our worries. In fact, the standard for floating point,
IEEE 754, mentioned earlier, does have the notion of "negative zero", and it's
no big deal. But nevertheless, the sign-and-magnitude representation is not used
on any modern machine that I am aware of. That is because there is a <i>much</i>
better way of representing signed integers, that not only avoids having two
representations for 0, but actually ends up being much easier to deal with in
hardware. However, in order to really understand why this alternative
representation we're about to propose is better, we need to take a little
detour.
</p>

<h3>Learning to Add</h3>

<p>
Let's mentally put integer representation on the backburner for a minute.
Let's think about how CPUs work on the lowest possible level (the lowest that I
can grasp myself anyway).
</p>

<p>
The most basic component of a CPU is a switch that can be controlled by an
electrical current: when a current is present, the switch is ON, and when there
is no current present, the switch is OFF. You could build a crude switch like
that yourself using a few pieces of metal, insulation and some wire - it's
called a relay.
</p>

<p>
Some early machines might have used relays (which were huge and unreliable), but
modern machines use a different kind of switch - the transistor, which is 
semiconductor-based. It's extremely reliable, and can be made so tiny that 
it's possible to cram billions of these things into a small space. Still, the
principle is the same - a transistor is a simple switch, controlled by
electrical current, it's just miniscule in size.
</p>

<p>
By wiring switches together in a particular manner, one can build <i>logic
gates</i> - tangible hardware implementations of the AND/OR/NOT/XOR/etc.
functions that most programmers are familiar with. For example, here's a diagram
showing how you can build an OR logic gate from two switches:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/sw_OR_tmb.jpg">
<br>
<small><i>Image credit: simplecpudesign.com</i></small>
</p>

<p>
If any one of the switches (labelled A and B respectively) is turned on, the
output (labelled Z) will have current.
If both A and B are off, Z will have no current. Switches act as "operands" for
the logical OR operation, and the output Z represents the result.
</p>

<p>
Logic gates can be further wired together to make more complex circuits, and
so on.
</p>

<p>
So, fundamentally, a CPU is a giant collection of interconnected logic gates
that consist of tiny electrically operated switches. With that in mind, I invite
you to consider the question: how does a CPU actually do arithmetic? For
example, how does it add two positive integers?
</p>

<p>
Turns out, you can wire together logic gates to make circuits that can perform
arithmetic operations.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider adding two single-bit numbers. Forget about negative numbers for
now, let's just handle positives. Note that result itself can be larger than
1 bit, so we'll add a second, "carryover" bit to it. There are only 4
possibilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>0 + 0 = 0 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>0 + 1 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 0 = 1 in the result bit, 0 in the carryover bit</li>
<li>1 + 1 = 0 in the result bit, 1 in the carryover bit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The pattern in the result bits looks like a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth table</a> for a
familiar boolean operation - exclusive OR (aka XOR). The pattern in the
carryover bit looks like the truth table of a boolean AND operation. So, a
circuit for adding two single-bit values can be built with a XOR gate and an AND
gate. It's called a half-adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/ha.png">
</p>

<p>
When we try adding two 2-bit numbers, things start to get real hairy. We need to
take into account the carryover bit from adding the first two bits when adding
the second two bits. So we can't just string together two half-adders to add two
2-bit numbers. We need to design a circuit that adds <i>three</i> bits: two 
"regular" bits and one carryover bit from the previous single-bit addition.
Such a circuit is called a full adder:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/fa.png">
</p>


<p>
By stringing together a half-adder and a full adder, we can finally get a
circuit that can add two-bit numbers:
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-3/2-bit-addr.gif">
</p>

<p>
In general, by stringing together several full adders one after another, we can
build blocks for adding numbers with more bits. Such blocks are called
ripple-carry adders.

<p>I’ve been in a reflective mood lately, probably because it’s the end of a very eventful year. Change is all around us and technology is the enabler.</p>



<p>On that note, I’ve been thinking a lot about my own experiences with technology-driven change in the reinsurance industry, where I worked as an analyst from 2017 until recently.</p>



<p>During these three short years, I observed a radical shift in data analysis methodologies. Excel-based models, which had seemed top-of-the-line suddenly were too slow and too rigid; Integration with 3rd party data sources, which was once a luxury, became the norm; And analysts began to utilize scripts to accomplish many labor-intensive tasks typically performed by hand or in spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Enabling this change is a suite of accessible Python-powered tools. These technologies are rapidly displacing the old way of doing things, ushering in a new wave of reinsurance models and the talent needed to support them.</p>



<p>Admittedly, the following observations do come from a very niche industry. But I believe that the broader trends discussed here will also apply to other legacy companies and sectors.</p>



<p>In this post, I explore the following topics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Section 1</strong> – An introduction to reinsurance</li><li><strong>Section 2 – </strong>The need for technological disruption in the reinsurance industry</li><li><strong>Sections 3 to 5</strong> – How Python is replacing Excel</li><li><strong>Section 6 </strong>– Arguments against adopting new technologies</li><li><strong>Section 7</strong> – The evolution of the reinsurance industry</li></ul>



<p>If you are curious about the transition from Excel to Python but aren’t interested in reinsurance, skip to section 3.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="406" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-1024x406.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-300x119.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python-768x304.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/ditching-excel-for-python.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>1. Reinsurance, from an analyst’s perspective</h2>



<p>Most people understand insurance, but few have heard of its rather exotic sounding cousin: reinsurance. So, before I begin, here’s a quick intro:</p>



<p>Just as individuals transfer risk to insurers in exchange for a premium, insurers too must mitigate their risk by transferring some or all of their liabilities to one or more reinsurance companies. This enables insurers to protect themselves in the case of a large event, such as a hurricane, which affects many individual policyholders. Without reinsurers, insurance companies would not be able to survive catastrophes and would be much more risk averse, ultimately impacting the end consumer.</p>



<p>Reinsurance programs come in a variety of flavors to suit the need of the reinsured. I’ll spare you the details but suffice it to say that all potential reinsurance programs must first be analyzed. In industry speak, this is the process of “pricing a deal”.</p>



<p>For each deal, brokers gather relevant data from the insurance companies and send it to potential reinsurers as a “submission”. It is the underwriting analyst’s responsibility to parse this data, enter it into Excel-based models and produce a number.</p>



<p>This number, the loss ratio, represents the expected loss divided by the total premium and typically ranges between 10% to 150+%. LRs above 100% mean that the premium is not sufficient to cover the losses that we expect based on our model. In other words, we’d be writing the deal at a loss.</p>



<p>In reality, reinsurance companies have pricing hurdles well below 100% because they have other money outflows to account for such as brokerage (intermediary fees) and G&amp;A (general and administrative expenses).</p>



<p>The point is, Excel is the key piece of software that enables underwriting teams to assess new business. Throughout the company, different teams use different models, each with different processes and different pricing hurdles. But the one common theme is that all of the models are based on Excel spreadsheets. That’s just how the industry works. Everyone uses Excel for everything.</p>



<p>Well, until recently.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-4.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>2. Change is coming</h2>



<p>In an industry that is notoriously behind the times, a fundamental change is underway. This change is in response to new business demands, including:</p>



<ol><li>The desire to price increasingly complex deals with increasingly large datasets</li><li>The desire to integrate with 3rd party data to augment pricing models</li><li>The desire for faster models and robust codebases that adhere to software development best practices</li></ol>



<p>Excel fails miserably at these tasks.</p>



<p>First, expressing complex reinsurance deals requires tabs and tabs of structural details, interlinking formulas and limiting assumptions. It’s a mess to build and a headache to understand. Have a lot of data? That’s more tabs and formulas to add to the model. Performance slows dramatically and minutes of your life are wasted waiting for bloated spreadsheets to finally open.</p>



<p>Second, you’re forced to use the VBA programming language if you want to query external data or implement user-defined functionality. According to one Stack Overflow survey, VBA ranked “most dreaded” of all the languages, which wholly sums up my feelings. The development environment is not user friendly, the syntax confusing, there’s no support for unit testing –&nbsp;I could go on.</p>



<p>Third, Excel is fragile. Views and logic are intermingled, making it very hard to troubleshoot errors. Also, models aren’t put into source control, so you can’t restore an old version. Massive spreadsheets with dozens of tabs frequently crash without warning, much to the dismay of underwriting analysts (like myself).</p>



<p>During my three years in reinsurance, I witnessed a dire need for new tooling. And, from what I observed, it is clear that this tooling will be powered by Python.</p>







<figure><img width="1024" height="190" src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" data-src="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-1024x190.jpg 1024w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-300x56.jpg 300w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2-768x142.jpg 768w, https://amypeniston.com/downloads/Image-2.jpg 1500w"></figure>



<h2>3. The future is Python</h2>



<p>As a technical underwriting analyst with programming skills, I was among the first to build and benefit from what I think are the next generation of pricing tools. These tools fall into two main categories:</p>



<ul><li>Excel models running Python code</li><li>Python notebooks in the browser</li></ul>



<p>Both options offer enhanced analysis capabilities while still catering to a non-technical or semi-technical end user.</p>



<p>Now, let’s explore each technology in more detail.</p>



<h2>4. Excel models running Python code</h2>



<p>The first category of new technology is based on augmentation. Rather than adding VBA code to your Excel spreadsheet, you can use Python instead. This is possible thanks to 3rd party Excel add-ins such <a href="https://www.pyxll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PyXLL</a>, which brings the power of Python data analysis into the humble spreadsheet.</p>



<p>When you open Excel, the add-in makes your Python code accessible either as functions or as macros. This means that you can write Python code in the development environment of your choice, add unit tests, integrate with 3rd party libraries and push to source control.</p>



<p>PyXLL facilitated a step change in how we construct reinsurance models. Specifically, here’s how our setup looked before and after augmenting our model with Python:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Before Python</strong></td><td><strong>After Python</strong></td></tr><tr><td>We used an Excel spreadsheet-based model with dozens of tabs containing complex formulas, endless pivot tables and unintelligible VBA code.</td><td>The tangled mess of VBA was re-written into independent Python modules, each of which performs a distinct function.</td></tr><tr><td>The spreadsheet took 30+ seconds to open.</td><td>The Excel spreadsheet is now just a view, so it is lightweight and quick to open.</td></tr><tr><td>There was no visibility into errors. “Debugging” meant manually breaking apart lengthy Excel formulas.</td><td>The new model logic is testable and can be upgraded independently.</td></tr><tr><td>We were limited by the assumptions made when the model was first created, with little ability to add new features.</td><td>The codebase lives in source control, enabling multiple collaborators to work in tandem.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Developers can use their preferred development environment.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A robust peer review process helps to perpetuate high quality code.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Using PyXLL, we built an underwriting pricing model powered entirely by Python code. We were able to express structural complexities of deals at a level never before achieved. And we were able to add simulation-based pricing techniques that simply cannot be done using spreadsheets alone.</p>



<p>The impact of PyXLL on how we build models and ultimately price business cannot be understated.</p>



<p>Which leads us to the second technology that is changing the way we perform underwriting data analysis…</p>

<h2>5. Python notebooks in the browser</h2>



<p>The second novel approach to reinsurance risk assessment and pricing is enabled via Python notebooks. These are web-based documents that can contain narrative text, live code, charts and visuals, plus results from your data analysis. </p>



<p>Python notebooks are all about collaboration, visualization and rapid iteration. They are a way to execute code with minimal setup and overhead, making it easier for new programmers to explore data outside of Excel. One of my favorite parts of notebooks is how easy it is to access your data, whether that’s from a file, SQL databases or an external source.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what a data analysis project looked like for me with and without Python notebooks:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Without Python Notebooks</strong></td><td><strong>With Python Notebooks</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Manually query SQL databases and copy data into Excel. Keep data fresh by re-querying SQL and copying in new data.</td><td>Drop in a csv file, connect directly to an internal SQL database or utilize a 3rd party API to retrieve external data.</td></tr><tr><td>Perform analysis using Excel functions, pivot tables and VBA code. Functions quickly became unwieldy and difficult to troubleshoot.</td><td>Manipulate data easily and rapidly using Python libraries like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandas</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Collaborate with a colleague by closing Excel and letting your colleague know that the spreadsheet is available for them to work on.</td><td>Collaborate with colleagues by sharing the notebook.</td></tr><tr><td>Copy tabular results and charts into Word or Powerpoint and add written narrative as necessary.</td><td>Export results to csv or generate professional-looking PDFs to give directly to key stakeholders.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Add explanatory narrative directly to the document alongside related code blocks.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Create interactive charts and static visuals using libraries like <a href="https://plotly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plotly</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seaborn</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matplotlib</a>.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Leverage existing libraries like <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SciPy</a> or <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scikit-learn</a> to …</td></tr></tbody></table></figure></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Matestack Ui Core Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>In this step-by-step guide, I will show you how to create a Twitter clone in pure Ruby with Matestack, following the great screencasts from Chris McCord <a href="https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI">Phoenix LiveView Twitter Clone</a> and Nate Hopkins <a href="https://youtu.be/F5hA79vKE_E">Stimulus Reflex Twitter Clone</a>. We will use the Gem <code>matestack-ui-core</code>, which enables us to implement our UI in some Ruby classes rather than writing ERB, HAML or Slim views. Furthermore we don't need to touch JavaScript in order to create reactive UI features, such as updating the DOM without a full browser page reload or syncing multiple web clients through Action Cable!</p>

<p>I've added a screencast (two parts) showing you what you will be doing in this tutorial:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mue5gs6Wtq4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Mue5gs6Wtq4/0.jpg" width="350"></a></p>

<p><em>This guide utilizes the full power of Matestack and uses <code>matestack-ui-core</code> as a complete substitute for Rails views. If you only want to create UI components in pure Ruby on existing Rails views, please check out <a href="https://docs.matestack.io/docs/ui_components/100-rails_integration">this guide</a></em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p>
<p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p>
<p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p>
<p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p>
<p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p>
<p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p>
<p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p>
<p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when youâ€™re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p>
<p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote>
<p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p>
<p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p>
<p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p>
<p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p>
<p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Promotional text:

Over the holidays, spent some time reflecting on the past 7 years of Sourcegraph and the state of developer tools in general. Very excited to see what the future holds (and to bring the future sooner with our work). It's time to buildâ€”developer tools: https://beyang.org/time-to-build-dev-tools.html

-->
<h2><span>It's time to build developer tools</span><span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2020.12.29</span></h2>
<p>We are living through a golden age in developer tools.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=software+is+eating+the+world">Software is eating the world</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=every+company+is+a+software+company">Every company is now a software company</a>.</p>
<p>Every software company needs developers—and developer tools.</p>
<p>The ecosystem of companies building tools for developers is booming. If you are a developer who loves the art and craft of programming, if you like working on <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/optimizing-a-code-intel-indexer/">technical problems beyond scaling CRUD</a>, or if you love the idea of accelerating technological progress by building tools for people like yourself, you should think about working on dev tools!</p>
<h2>Historic forces, immense opportunity</h2>
<p>Every company that now writes code has discovered (or is discovering) that software development is really tricky. The world needs more software, but it’s not as simple as hiring more developers. Building software doesn’t scale or parallelize easily. Serial dependencies coupled with unforeseen complexity lead to gross underestimates of timeline and budget, which in turn lead to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/30/companies-that-failed-at-digital-transformation-and-what-we-can-learn-from-them">bad</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/03/why-so-many-high-profile-digital-transformations-fail">business</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/heres-why-ge-fords-digital-transformation-programs-failed-last-year.html">outcomes</a> and even <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/08/19/10-great-companies-that-lost-their-edge">existential</a> <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp">crises</a>.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of developing software quickly and efficiently at scale, more and more companies are building and buying developer tools. It’s no longer just the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts, and Amazons of the world spending serious money doing so.</p>
<p>To satisfy this increasingly apparent need, a rapidly growing new industry of developer tool companies has arisen in recent years. Individual names like GitHub, GitLab, and HashiCorp are now well known and the emergence of the field has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/10/16/developer-tools-quietly-become-a-growth-story/">not</a> <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/rise-of-the-developer">gone</a> <a href="https://alven.co/the-debrief-go-to-market-in-dev-tools-part-1/">unnoticed</a>.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to overstate how quickly the market for developer tools has grown in the past decade.
When Quinn and I started Sourcegraph back in 2013, we quickly discovered that “dev tool” was a dirty word among investors. Developer tools, it was thought, were super valuable, but most of them were single player tools that didn’t make enough money (e.g., JetBrains, Sublime Text), internal tools built for the specific needs of a particular big tech company (e.g., Google Code Search), or open-source projects that no one paid for and which you could only make money from by selling services and support. Investors told us there was just one billion-dollar company that sold to developers—Red Hat—and it was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p>Developers were building lots of valuable software that was sold to other folks—salespeople, marketers, designers, etc.—but when it came to their own work, the common refrain was, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/159004/the-cobblers-children-have-no-shoes">“the cobbler’s children have no shoes”</a>. An article in TechCrunch lamented, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/22/will-developer-tools-startups-ever-find-investors/">“Will Developer Tools Startups Ever Find Investors?"</a></p>
<p>But then, somewhere along the line of the past seven years, something changed. Evidence of this shift is in the valuations: <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/">GitHub acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/-gitlab-valued-over-6-billion-in-secondary-share-sale.html">GitLab valued at $6 billion</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/hashicorp-soars-above-5b-valuation-in-new-175m-venture-round/">HashiCorp at $5 billion</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/czech-startup-founders-turn-billionaires-without-vc-help">JetBrains estimated at $7 billion</a>, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But though the big numbers with lots of zeroes raise eyebrows and make the headlines, they are just the byproduct of the underlying factors driving big changes in where and how software is built. To list a few of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Competition from Big Tech and tech-enabled startups moving into every industry is driving every company to prioritize software as a core competency.</li>
<li><strong>Big Code:</strong> The amount of code in the world has been growing rapidly, and more and more companies have reached a tipping point previously reached only by the largest tech companies.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise OSS:</strong> The maturation of “the cloud” as a software platform built on top of open-source software (Linux and Kubernetes), in contrast to older software platforms, which were vertically integrated proprietary ecosystems (e.g., Windows + .NET + Visual Studio).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other trends at play here, but one thing is certain: almost every valuable or growing company is now building software and most have realized they need great developer tools to compete.</p>
<p>This is fantastic news. “Tech” has traditionally been a distinct sector of the economy, and the ability to build software effectively at scale was confined to a handful of big technology companies. Now, companies in every sector understand that code has to become a core part of their DNA. And this means the impact of code and software is amplified. No longer does the value proposition of software have to flow through some product or service offered by a “tech company”—companies across every sector of the economy are now learning how to build great software themselves.</p>
<p>As the broader economy learns to build software, progress will accelerate. All the promises that the future holds—<a href="https://grail.com/">cures for cancer</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">life-saving</a> <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/">medicine</a>, <a href="http://uber.com/">mass</a> <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">individualized</a> <a href="https://comma.ai/">transportation</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spacex-rockets-fly-with-software-you-can-find-on-your-android-phone/">rocketships</a>, and more—will arrive sooner in large part thanks to code. Software has long been recognized as a technological accelerant. But developer tools are now a <em>second-order accelerant</em> on technological progress. This is an immense opportunity.</p>
<p>How best to pursue it?</p>
<h2>Large companies, open source, and startups</h2>
<p>There are three places where you can work on developer tools. (There may be more, but for brevity’s sake, we’ll focus on these.)</p>
<p>The first is inside a large non-developer-tool company. Many large companies that build software are investing heavily in internal tools. There have been a lot of great dev tools created inside large companies, and many such tools have inspired the creation of similar tools outside the company. Blaze, the build system of Google, inspired other build systems like Pants and Facebook’s Buck and was later itself open-sourced as Bazel. Large companies also offer the benefit of a large, stable salary. The downside is that the direct impact of your work will likely be limited to a single organization. It’s possible that your work will be open-sourced down the road, but there is no guarantee, and it can often take years to get the necessary legal and bureaucratic approvals to do so. And, of course, you don’t have a direct piece of the financial upside if the tool becomes super widely used.</p>
<p>The second place you can build dev tools is on an open-source project. Working in the open guarantees you will receive recognition for your work, and you also have the benefit of not having any pesky pricing considerations standing in between your users and your product. If mass adoption is your primary goal, then open source holds great appeal. Many of the most widely used developer tools—Git, Linux, Emacs, Vim, etc.—are open source projects. The downside, of course, is lack of revenue. Most open-source authors and maintainers have an alternate source of income (often working at a large tech company). Patreon and GitHub Sponsors are great, but it’s likely that only a small fraction of open-source creators will ever earn enough to make a comfortable living through sponsorship alone. The number of hours you can devote to working on open source will be constrained by where you can find sources of income.</p>
<p>The third place is at a developer tools company. Most such companies will be startups, because of the rapid growth in market size for dev tools over the past few years. Dev tools companies offer the benefit of aligned incentives: your users, your customers, and even your fellow engineering teammates are often the same people. If you build a great tool, then your users are happy, you get paid so you are also happy, and you and your teammates can also make use of the same tool, so that should make you doubly happy! Dev tool startups have the additional benefit of financial upside (assuming part of your compensation is an equity stake in the business). This upside could be substantial. Personally, I think we are in the early days of the developer tools market. I believe the impact of high-quality, broadly useful dev tools will someday far exceed the impact of <a href="https://www.google.com/">ads-driven web search</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">PC operating systems</a>, and <a href="https://facebook.com/">social media</a>. Which is to say, I think that the value of developer tool companies will someday exceed the combined value of the most valuable tech companies today.</p>
<p>Of course, startups also carry a downside risk. There is a high chance that the company will fail to meet its lofty goals, or may need to lay people off, or fail completely. There is no one-size-fits-all prescription for the best place to work. Personally, the principle I follow is, “Maximize expected utility subject to minimizing the risk of ruin,” where the definition of “utility” and “ruin” is up to you to define.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you opt for large companies, open source, or dev tool startups, there is still the question of how to evaluate which specific opportunities and tools are worthy of your time. For that, you’ll need to rely on a combination of intuition and worldview, which we’ll discuss next.</p>
<h2>Scratch your own itch, but understand the big picture</h2>
<p>Jamie Zawinski once said, “The best motivator in the world is scratching your own itch.” He was talking about developer tools, and he was right. Most developer tools start with a programmer noticing they have a problem, imagining a way to fix the problem through software automation, and then writing the code that implements that automation. Building for yourself means you get to wear the hat of product manager, engineer, and customer simultaneously. This is a fantastic recipe for building something truly useful, not just for yourself, but for other people who feel the same pain. As you evaluate the landscape of enterprise developer tools, you should rely heavily on your own intuition for where pain points exist and which products offer effective solutions.</p>
<p>However, you’ll also want to combine your direct intuition with a broader view of how software development works—what is common across companies and sectors and what is different and specific to the segment of the market you are building for. It’s important to understand where your itch fits into the overall picture, how others experience that itch, and how <em>their</em> itch fits into <em>their</em> picture.</p>
<p>The way software is …</p></div></div>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

			<h6>Computer cases, in their majority, have some significant disadvantages. They are close-type plastic boxes almost identical to each other and are located mainly under our desks.
New trends such as “case-modding” and “custom desk-setup” appeared to change the monotony of ordinary computers, or even offices, by gaming-enthusiast users who mainly focus on building high-end hardware and opting for top class performance!
However, such a passion drives easily to exaggerations, both in the aesthetic and operation sector, with PC implementations that have tremendous energy needs, high temperatures, air-flow problems and of course high costs!

        <p>This post is for everyone who is trying to start a company right now. </p><p>The headlines make it seem easy. </p><p>20 year old kids raising millions of dollars to build the next Snapchat. Smug digital nomads posted up on a beach in Thailand making $75k/month. That lifestyle design dude who made $200k selling a Twitter course this year. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not that simple. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>It's fucking hard. </strong></p><p>At least it was for me. </p><p>I wanted to be a millionaire by 30. I was broke at 25. </p><p>I launched dozens of products, navigated through the minefield, and came out of it with business that exceeded all my expectations - millions in annual recurring revenue. </p><p>Here's the true story. </p><h2 id="year-0-inspiration-">Year 0 (inspiration)</h2><p>About 10 years ago I unofficially graduated university. </p><p>I had the credits to finish early, but stuck around to take one last class. That class </p><p>New Venture Design - it paired up business and engineering students to build a company. </p><p>That class changed my life.</p><p>My accounting major put me in the "useless business guy" category, so I consciously recruited the only two software engineers in the class. </p><p>The project we dreamed up was a daylighting system for commercial office buildings we called Luminex. </p><p>Essentially, reflective venetian blinds that tracked the sun and automatically reflected light into the ceiling - so you can work at your computer with natural light and no glare. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-5.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-5.png 625w"><figcaption>Rendering of the project</figcaption></figure><p>Still one of my best ideas. </p><p>Instead of testing it in the market, the primary objective of that class was to compete in business plan competitions.

Recruiting events with a bunch of 20 year olds putting on suits to impress 23 year olds in suits for the privilege of making $40k/year working 80 hours a week. &nbsp;The weird reverence for McKinsey and KPMG. </p><p>I had some experience making my own money - running a window cleaning company that grossed $45k one summer - and once you've charged your friends out for $30/hr and paid them $15, it's hard to imagine working for anyone else. </p><p>The three of us were ready to build a hardware company. With $10,000. </p><p>A month after jumping into the abyss, we quickly realized we had no idea what we were doing and no money to do it with. The extent of our market validation was a few random people telling us our idea was good, and a prototype with some really decent software on it. </p><p>It took 3 months to realize it was never going to work. One engineer quit. </p><p>We were down to a partnership with no plan, no direction, no strategy, and no money.

I didn't even know what a job looked like (still don't!). </p><p>My only goals were to make that rent payment, drink a few beers, try to meet women, and eat. My business partner and I turned to what we knew. </p><p>Craigslist. </p><p>More specifically, web development on Craigslist. </p><p>We started building average Wordpress websites for small businesses, averaging $1000 to $4000 per month in sales from posting ads on Craigslist. </p><p>To supplement that kinglike income, we also started blogging on Seeking Alpha - writing stock investment advice for $80-$300 per article. </p><figure><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/296864-apples-future-is-in-the-icloud"><div><p>Stock Picks, Stock Market Investing</p><p><img src="https://seekingalpha.com/samw/static/images/favicon-192x192.png"><span>SeekingAlpha</span></p></div><p><img src="https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png"></p></a></figure><p>I had never bought a stock, and here I was - writing about Apple's future. </p><p>I should have bought Apple stock. </p><p>We shipped dozens of projects. </p><p>A website that paired up students and businesses, an events listing website, a Wordpress theme directory, a platform that helped companies pre-test job applicants skills, and many other forgotten ones. </p><p>The worst one was probably office composting. </p><p>Urban Dirt picked up your organic waste (in a rented Zipcar, as I didn't own a vehicle), and dropped it off at a composting facility for $30/week. </p><p>We got 10 customers for that business, and nearly landed the contract for Rogers Arena (Home of the Canucks) through a cold call. Hundreds of dollars of revenue wasn't enough, so we decided to make a huge bet on making our own fertilizer out of used coffee grounds from Starbucks. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 1140w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This image gives me shivers.</figcaption></figure><p>We spent weeks drying coffee grounds on homemade racks and packaging it in paper bags to sell at farmers markets.

I'm sure I've told the story about how we wanted to hire for our web design agency and needed a way to track applicants so we built this software to solve our own problem. </p><p>That's a lie - our agency never hired anyone. We probably built that software because I saw it somewhere and it looked like something we could build. </p><p>Anyways, we built an applicant tracking system (it worked!) and I hustled my ass off to sign up customers. </p><p>A few companies (thanks Charlyne, Heidi, and Gord) believed in us enough to pay us a little bit of money for it. From there, we had a few more ideas around the recruitment space - again, likely borrowed. One idea was a really cool tool that helped asynchronously test out job applicants skills before they got hired. </p><p>Similar to Codility, but for everyone. </p><p>We couldn't get customers. People just wanted an applicant tracking system. </p><p>We tried to make that applicant tracking system sexier, by allowing companies to add pictures/videos of their companies to their job postings. Like Unbounce for your job postings. No one wanted it. </p><p>We got desperate. </p><p>To promote our product, we decided to host an online job fair. We dreamed up the idea for an online event where candidates could visit company "booths," chat with recruiters, and drop their resume. </p><p>We set a 6 week deadline to launch and promote it. </p><p>I hit the phones hard, and signed up 40 companies. My cofounder built the software. We got press in some of the countries' <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/bc-tech-fair-delivers-online-job-fair">biggest publications</a>. Thousands of candidates pre-registered for the event. </p><figure><img src="https://www.mistakesofambition.com/content/images/2020/12/image-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>We went live on 2pm on Monday, July 23rd. </p><p>Our servers crashed. </p><p>I punched a wall. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattfromlater">Matt</a> (who we were sharing an office space with) got our servers back up, and the site held together for a few hours. Overall it was a very average experience, but enough to get us on the radar of Growlab - Vancouver's version of YCombinator. </p><p>Growlab was a group of experienced entrepreneurs and mentors who invested $20,000 in startups with the goal of helping them raise more money.

	<p><small>December 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/the-easy-ones-three-bugs-hiding-in-the-open/">The Easy Ones â€“ Three Bugs Hiding in the Open</a>,
Bruce Dawson gave us a little C puzzle in passing:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h">variable arguments</a> in
printf formatting means that it is easy to get type mismatches. The
practical results vary considerably:</p>

<ol><li>printf(â€œ0x%08lxâ€�, p); // Printing a pointer as an int â€“ truncation or worse on 64-bit </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%d, %fâ€�, f, i); // Swapping float and int â€“ could print nonsense, or might actually work (!) </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%s %dâ€�, i, s); // Swapping the order of string and int â€“ will probably crash</li>
</ol>

<p>[...] (aside: understanding why #2 often
prints the desired result is a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> puzzle)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to think about this for a bit, and then I realized why and
how it can work (and why similar integer versus float argument
confusion can also work for other functions, even ones with fixed
argument lists). What it comes down to is that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a>s,
arguments are passed in registers (at least early arguments, before
you run out of registers), and <strong>floating point arguments are passed
in different registers than integers (and pointers)</strong>.  This is
true even for functions that take variable arguments and will walk
through them using stdarg macros (or at least it can be, depending
on the ABI).</p>

<p>Because floating point and non floating point arguments are passed
in different sets of registers, what matters isn't the total order
of arguments but the order of floating point or non-fp arguments.
So here, regardless of where '%f' is in the printf format, it always
causes printf() to get the first floating point argument, which can
never be confused with an integer argument. Similarly, the first
'%d' causes printf() to look for the second non-fp argument,
regardless of where it was in the argument order; it could be at
the end of several floating point arguments and still work.</p>

<p>(The '%d' makes printf() look for the second non-fp argument because
the first one was the format string. In an ABI that passed pointers
in a separate place than integers, it would still work out, since now
the first '%d' would be looking for the first integer argument.)</p>

<p>Using the excellent services of godbolt.org, we can see this in
action on 64-bit x86 in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hYz9Gn">a very small example</a> (I used a very small example and a
decent optimization level to get clear, minimal assembly code). The
floating point argument is passed in <code>xmm0</code>, while the format string
and the integer argument are passed in <code>edi</code> and <code>esi</code> respectively
(I don't know what <code>eax</code> is doing, but it probably has something
to do with the ABI). A similar thing happens on 64-bit ARM v8 (aka
Aarch64), as we can also see on godbolt with <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jrxz96">the same example on
Aarch64</a>.</p>

<p>(Based on <a href="https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/AArch64_Register_and_Instruction_Quick_Start">this page</a>,
the Aarch64 <code>x0</code> and <code>w1</code> are in the same set of registers. Apparently
<code>d0</code> is a 64-bit version of the first floating point register, from
<a href="https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/pdf/graphics-and-multimedia/ARMv8_InstructionSetOverview.pdf">here</a>
[pdf]. I wound up looking up all of this to be sure I understood
what was going on in the Aarch64 call, so I might as well write it
down here.)</p>

<p>Since pointers and integers are normally passed in the same set of
registers (at least on 64-bit x86 and Aarch64), we can also see why
the third example is very likely to fail. Since the same set of
registers is used for both argument types, it's possible to use an
integer argument as a pointer argument, with a segmentation fault
as the likely result. Similarly, we can predict that '<code>printf("%s
%f", f, s);</code>' might well work.</p>

<p>PS: This confusion can happen in any language that follows the C
ABI on a platform with this sort of split usage of registers (although
many languages may prevent this sort of argument type confusion).
Not all languages do; famously, Go currently passes all arguments
on the stack (as of Go 1.15 and soon Go 1.16).</p>

<![CDATA[Unsafe String Interning in Go]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><time datetime="2020-12-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">December 30, 2020</time></p><p>For a few months, I’ve been collaborating on the
<a href="https://inet.af/netaddr"><code>inet.af/netaddr</code></a> package for Go which introduces a
new <code>netaddr.IP</code> type as an alternative to the standard library’s
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/#IP"><code>net.IP</code></a> type. There are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/inet.af/netaddr#readme-motivation">a variety of reasons
for this</a>, but those are
not the focus of today’s blog.</p><p>The folks over at <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> have been working on
improving the performance of the package in various ways, including shrinking
the size of types and trying out faster internal IP representations.
Specifically, one topic that came up was <a href="https://github.com/inetaf/netaddr/pull/57">how to shrink <code>netaddr.IP</code> from 32
bytes to 24 bytes</a>, the same size
as a Go slice header.</p><p>Because a <code>netaddr.IP</code> can also have an associated zone for IPv6 link-local
addresses, the type previously contained a Go string, which occupies 16 bytes.
This is a good use case for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">string
interning</a>, a technique which
can be used to reduce the number of string allocations. It is highly likely that
a small number of zone identifiers will be used repeatedly throughout a program,
so string interning seems like a great fit for this problem.</p><p>In addition, another need for <code>netaddr.IP</code> is to guarantee that identical input
strings will also have identical backing data pointers in the intern pool. This
ensures that the input strings are usable internally as map keys, can occupy
less space in the pool, and can be used to occupy only one word of memory within
the type rather than two, as a Go string header would.</p><p>The result of this work is the package
<a href="https://go4.org/intern"><code>go4.org/intern</code></a> which uses some pretty neat <code>unsafe</code>
tricks to implement efficient string interning using weak references and Go
finalizers. We’ll start by showing off the safe implementation and gradually
introduce the concepts needed to understand the unsafe one as well.</p><p>All credit for the ideas and implementation of <code>go4.org/intern</code> goes to <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_universetf">Dave
Anderson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/commaok">Josh Bleecher
Snyder</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a>. I simply watched the discussions
unfold on the issue tracker and thought that the code and the ideas behind it
were too interesting to not write up and share!</p><h2 id="safe-string-interning-in-go">Safe string interning in Go</h2><p>The basic idea of string interning is to retain a global pool of strings which
can be created or fetched on the fly, so that each string is allocated exactly
once for values which are identical. It’s worth noting that since our code will
accept empty <code>interface{}</code>, you could use it with any type which can be used as
a map key. This blog will focus on strings, but the same API could be used for
comparing the equality of a large struct type as well.</p><p>In its most basic form, you could implement <code>go4.org/intern</code> (with a caveat!) by
writing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> intern

<span>// A Value pointer is the handle to an underlying comparable value.
</span><span>// See func Get for how Value pointers may be used.
</span><span></span><span>type</span> Value <span>struct</span> {
	<span>// Enforce that Values cannot be used directly for equality comparisons.
</span><span></span>	<span>// We'll explain why a bit later.
</span><span></span>	_      [0]<span>func</span>()
	cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}
}

<span>// Get returns the comparable value passed to the Get func
</span><span>// that returned v.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> (v *Value) Get() <span>interface</span>{} { <span>return</span> v.cmpVal }

<span>// Our pool of interned values and a lock to serialize access.
</span><span></span><span>var</span> (
	mu      sync.Mutex
	val = <span>map</span>[<span>interface</span>{}]*Value{}
)

<span>// Get returns a pointer representing the comparable value cmpVal.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// The returned pointer will be the same for Get(v) and Get(v2)
</span><span>// if and only if v == v2, and can be used as a map key.
</span><span>//
</span><span>// Note that Get returns a *Value so we only return one word of data
</span><span>// to the caller, despite potentially storing a large amount of data
</span><span>// within the Value itself.
</span><span></span><span>func</span> Get(cmpVal <span>interface</span>{}) *Value {
	mu.Lock()
	<span>defer</span> mu.Unlock()

	v := val[cmpVal]
	<span>if</span> v != <span>nil</span> {
		<span>// Value is already interned in the pool.
</span><span></span>		<span>return</span> v
	}

	<span>// Value must be created now and then interned.
</span><span></span>	v = &amp;Value{cmpVal: cmpVal}
	val[cmpVal] = v
	<span>return</span> v
}</code></pre></div><p>Usage of the package is straightforward at this point:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> TestBasics(t *testing.T) {
	foo := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)
	foo2 := intern.Get(<span>"foo"</span>)

	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != foo2.Get() {
		t.Error(<span>"foo values differ"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo.Get() != <span>"foo"</span> {
		t.Error(<span>"foo.Get not foo"</span>)
	}
	<span>if</span> foo != foo2 {
		t.Error(<span>"foo pointers differ"</span>)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The global pool in the library stored the string <code>"foo"</code> on the first call to
<code>intern.Get("foo")</code> and the same <code>*intern.Value</code> was returned and stored in both
<code>foo</code> and <code>foo2</code>.</p><p>However there is a caveat to this approach: the pool can never shrink. If we
keep adding more distinct values to the pool, it will continue to grow in size
and allocate more memory until our program eventually runs out of memory and
crashes. Even if we don’t add more values, we’ve still stranded some of our
memory for the entire duration of the program’s execution.</p><p>In fact, this is the tradeoff made by <code>go4.org/intern</code> for the “safe” operating
mode of the package. If you run your program with the environment variable
<code>GO4_INTERN_SAFE_BUT_LEAKY=true</code> then no unsafe tricks will be used, and the
intern pool will continue to grow as more items are added. For some programs,
this may be an acceptable tradeoff, but there’s much more to be discussed!</p><h2 id="breaking-the-unsafe-rules">Breaking the unsafe rules</h2><p>In order to make use of string interning while also cooperating with Go’s
garbage collector to remove and free unused values from the pool, it is
necessary to bend the package <code>unsafe</code> rules. This is what inspired me to author
this blog: I’ve written a lot of unsafe code in the past but have never
intentionally stepped outside the guard rails that the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/#Pointer"><code>unsafe.Pointer</code> rules
provide for you</a>.</p><p>Specifically, we have to violate rule number 3:</p><blockquote><p>(3) Conversion of a Pointer to a uintptr and back, with arithmetic.</p><p>… Note that both [uintptr and unsafe.Pointer] conversions must appear in the
same expression, with only the intervening arithmetic between them:</p></blockquote><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// INVALID: uintptr cannot be stored in variable
</span><span>// before conversion back to Pointer.
</span><span></span>u := uintptr(p)
p = unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code></pre></div><p>In a hypothetical future version of Go, it is possible that the value stored at
the address pointed at by the <code>p</code> in the Go heap could be moved in between the
conversion and assignment <code>u := uintptr(p)</code> and the pointer arithmetic <code>p =
unsafe.Pointer(u + offset)</code>.</p><p>Because we are relying on the invariant that the Go garbage collector (as of Go
1.15) does not move data in the heap, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz">Brad
Fitzpatrick</a> came up with a clever pseudo-package
which users can underscore import if they intend to violate this particular
package <code>unsafe</code> rule:
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc"><code>go4.org/unsafe/assume-no-moving-gc</code></a>.
If a program or its dependencies import this package and a future version of Go
uses a moving garbage collector which may rearrange items in the heap, the
package can be updated to fail compilation when the program’s behavior is now
invalid.</p><p>Technically, Go <em>does</em> have a moving garbage collector for its stacks as of Go
1.15. See <a href="https://github.com/go4org/unsafe-assume-no-moving-gc/issues/3">Matthew Dempsky’s issue for more
details</a>. Because

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="h.f0zdx2p8r8sq"><span>Writing my first Gameboy Emulator</span></p><p><span>Okay so today’s post might be a bit of a cheat because I’m nowhere near complete on this project. But I’m really excited, because I just got the Tetris title screen working!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/O9JwbvM5phtNcpgBj_2Un5C3QWVLTn24SWN43trTYG7ryH4enLNU6vbMzqMYwridlrhT8HswNBQNVUk19vTe87fsSwvJf0W-IsUEx6j8u13I1zKrktnzabBUzOf3lZcNor0lvGxV" title=""></span></p><p><span>This is the first time I’ve worked on an emulator and </span><span>oh boy</span><span>&nbsp;do I regret taking this long to get around to it. This has been one of the most rewarding projects I’ve worked on. Not only do I feel like I’m truly gaining a more fundamental understanding of the internals of a machine (which is sort of the point), but it is SO exciting suddenly seeing someone else’s software pop up on the screen.</span></p><p><span>I’m still working on this journey myself but I thought I’d share what I’ve done so far to hopefully encourage others to give this a go.</span></p><p><span>It all started with the bootrom. The gameboy didn’t have an operating system. It simply had a simple bootrom that showed you that famous Nintendo logo (which is actually </span><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cUIGHZLGA">a novel DRM scheme</a></span><span>). It’s a very simple program that you can read line by line making it pretty easy to work out where I was going wrong. I started by making a “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a></span><span>” which was just a big ol switch statement going through </span><span><a href="https://meganesulli.com/generate-gb-opcodes/">each opcode</a></span><span>. This is definitely the most labour intensive part of the project. There are a lot of opcodes.</span></p><p><span>What you quickly discover while implementing opcodes is that the gameboy memory is basically just an array. So next I created registers and an “</span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">MMU</a></span><span>” (the gameboy didn’t really have an MMU but this made things easier to manage). After around four days, I had the Nintendo logo rendering!</span></p><p><span><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xRho4Dq1Fo1vUdM6BNTShSDwfBupG_CSlcrlkG2m9MhC_O75h1T1krLYA16RbOXUSH0BO-W_6u-2B6opnDkgzO3BYHmHJLxgrWbaPEJfbhumMPHAZp0acPT2iL_86tIv3zCLl6DB" title=""></span></p><p><span>Simple rendering is pretty straightforward. The Gameboy would write to a certain region of memory reserved for video so all you need to do is read from there to know what you should render. Once I got that far - I was completely hooked. My approach of just implementing more and more Gameboy hardware was working.</span></p><p><span>There are already a ton of resources that go into far more detail:</span></p><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html">http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/gameboy.html</a></span></li><li><span><a href="http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU">http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU</a></span></li><li><span><a href="https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/">https://blog.ryanlevick.com/DMG-01/public/book/</a></span></li></ul><p><span>If you have the time and you’re interested, I would strongly suggest you give this project a go.

<div id="post-body"><p>I have recently bought an e-book by a <a href="https://gumroad.com/dellannaluca">Gumroad author</a> named <a href="https://twitter.com/DellAnnaLuca">Luca Dellana</a>. I have to admit I did it mainly to see how successful authors on Gumroad package their offerings. I was initially skeptical about the book, dismissing it as just another attempt to capitalize on the self-help trend. As I kept reading, however, I found a few clever references washing away my initial skepticism. One quote in particular, stuck in my mind, and I cannot seem to stop thinking about it: </p><blockquote>"If you think about it, the very important never feels urgent. Instead, <strong>most things which feel urgent are important <em>for someone else</em>, not for you."</strong></blockquote><p>Something so simple and yet so difficult to put through common sense. Modern life is full of urgency - from the moment we wake up to the time we go back to bed. Things coming from different directions, fighting for our undivided attention, non-stop.</p><p>The key is this. We acknowledge the presence of <strong>urgency</strong>, however, most of us wrongly attribute <strong>importance</strong> to it, putting the actually important stuff aside. In reality, things that matter usually become urgent when it is too late. In most other times, they are important for someone else, not for us.</p><p>Think about that project at work that so badly needed to be finished before the holidays. It must have brought a ton of pressure to you and your team, hasn't it? Yet, chances are, you would hardly remember it on your deathbed. Neither will your boss or their boss, either. The only person for whom it makes any difference is the one who created the business. If that is not you, I have news - you need to shift your focus. Start with your family and friends, for example. Or your health and passion. The kinds of things you always thought you would resort to doing someday, once you become rich and retired.</p><p>Do them now, instead of when it gets too late.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>«If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it will protect all of you.»<br>
<em>Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I like the quotation above. It’s a powerful statement and one of the reasons why I am not concerned when I hear positions I deeply detest. Well, as long as they are detested by society as well. Because if these people are heard, we just might have something similar to freedom of speech (we don’t have that first amendment in Germany).</p>
<p>But, damn, it’s not easy to listen to positions you don’t like.</p>
<p>I was recently reminded of that issue when I tried to listen to a “<a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast/culture-wars-with-andrew-doyle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Culture Wars with Andrew Doyle</a>” episode, <a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/podcast-episode/the-misogyny-of-trans-activism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in which he had Julie Bindel as a guest</a>. She’s a feminist, lesbian, and judging by what I have heard of her, does not like men very much. It’s all patriarchy, men &amp; violence, the whole narrative. At least that how that episode appeared to me.</p>
<p>And after less than half of the episode, I had enough.</p>
<p>I might agree with (part of) her criticism of trans-activists, but the way she talks about men — damn, she appeared to have been stuck in the past. Or rather, in an extremely antiquated view of men. It’s strange how in many other areas we talk about the overlap between men and women being greater than the differences (not in physical strength, but you get the idea), but when it comes to power somehow we are talking about two distinct populations.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.</p>
<p>That stick-in-the-mud perspective lost its appeal years ago. Just look at the number of homeless, suicides (actual, not attempts), murders, and much, much more. And sure, when it comes to murder, most of the murderers might me male, but would you really care about the sex of the murderer when you get murdered? I wouldn’t. I found her attitude appalling. And I am — again — very glad I am not a woman. If I had people like her ostensibly speak for me … I’d be mad as hell. Like when it comes to what makes a woman, or whether sex work is demeaning. Seriously? Why not let each person decide for <em>themselves</em> what the fuck that means and how they see that work?</p>
<p>I thought people — and that includes women — should decide for themselves?</p>
<p>And yeah, on another level, it was really funny (for a part of me) to hear that all those <em>unfair</em> strategies, all this emotional reasoning feminists used against men (and women who disagreed), is now used by trans-activists against feminists.</p>
<p>You’ve made your bed, you’ve used those strategies, now how do you like them apples?</p>
<p>But yeah, I take no pleasure in watching the world burn. So no, I don’t really take pleasure from seeing those kind of feminists tasting their own medicine. But even so, I found her views so appalling that I stopped listening. Which I also found interesting. I thought of myself as someone who is willing to differing perspectives, but I guess I found my limits.</p>
<p>And that is actually something valuable I will take from this “conversation”, well listening to that podcast: Nobody listens to you if you disparage their person, no matter how much they might agree with your point.</p>
<p>So, it was <em>surprisingly educating</em>.</p>

                <p><em>This is the fourth installment of my “year in review” series. 
For a recap, here’s <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">2019</a>,
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/a-tale-of-two-years/">2018</a> 
and <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/the-year-everything-changed/">2017</a>.</em></p>

<p>2020 was my fourth year of building my own internet businesses.
Like everyone else, my 2020 did <em>not</em> go according to plan.
And yet, things worked out in the end.</p>

<p>It was a year of big swings: starting with a taste of celebrity—followed by 
the collapse of my biggest business—and closing with record-breaking success.
Eventually I ended up almost exactly where I planned,
only the route was totally unexpected.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap of my 2020 in nine pictures.</p>

<h4 id="january-officially-an-indie-hacker">January: officially an Indie Hacker!</h4>

<p>In January, I met and recorded a podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen">Courtland Allen</a>,
founder of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> and a hero of mine. 
When <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/147-cory-zue-of-place-card-me">the podcast aired</a>,
I had a tiny taste of celebrity, hearing from people throughout the Twitter-verse
who were inspired by my story.
It was the most fun moment of my Indie Hacking career.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/first-subscription/me-and-courtland.jpg" alt="Meeting Courtland Allen"></p>

<p>Me and Courtland Allen in his Cape Town Airbnb. January, 2020.</p>

<p>Courtland also convinced me to double down on my <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">wedding place card app</a>—called Place Card Me—leading
to <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/first-subscription/">my first ever subscription revenue online</a>.</p>

<p>The year was looking good!</p>

<h4 id="march-the-pandemic-shakes-things-up">March: the pandemic shakes things up</h4>

<p>Fast forward to mid-March, and the world decided to take Covid-19 very seriously, very fast.</p>

<p>Place Card Me—my primary side-business—saw its revenue plummet to $0 almost overnight.
Not seeing a way to pivot, I decided to pause work on the project indefinitely—now
9 months and counting—and shift my focus to <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Pegasus, my Django boilerplate for SaaS apps</a>.
Sorry, Courtland!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/retros/misc/place-card-me-5-weeks-corona.png" alt="Place Card Me Revenue Feb-March"></p>

<p>Place Card Me’s revenue, late Feb - April 1. It has sinced picked up a bit, but remains
well off 2019’s numbers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, South Africa—where I live—introduced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world,
including banning alcohol sales and disallowing outdoor exercise.
I had to resort to running in circles around my flat.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/lockdown-run.png" alt="Lockdown Run"></p>

<p>My lockdown running route. Hundreds of circles around my small flat. March, 2020.</p>

<p>The lockdown also took away our childcare, so my wife and I split the work day in half.
My productive hours ended at noon, most of my time went to my day job,
and my side-businesses languished.</p>

<h4 id="may-my-first-record-breaking-month-of-the-year">May: my first record-breaking month of the year</h4>

<p>In May we got childcare back and for the first time in months I had time for proactive work.</p>

<p>I started by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/may-2020/">experimenting with some pricing changes</a> 
leading to Pegasus earning over $4,000—more than any of my products had ever earned in a single month.
I had to re-do the axes on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open">side-project dashboard</a>—where I track
my product revenue and effort—to accommodate the new high.</p>

<h4 id="july-august-distractions-and-failure">July-August: distractions and failure</h4>

<p>July and August saw my biggest divergence of the year.</p>

<p>Thinking it would be a good opportunity to exercise Pegasus, I decided to build and launch
a new product to provide <a href="https://repostory.app/">code review analytics for Github repositories</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, before I finished MVP I realized the project was too ambitious for the 
amount of time I was willing to devote to it.
So, following a lackluster launch, and seeing a long road ahead, 
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/aug-2020/">I decided to stop working on it indefinitely</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/repostory-social.png" alt="RepoStory"></p>

<p>RepoStory: my failed experiment building code review analytics product, launched to no one in August.</p>

<p>I still think the project has potential, but for now it’s lying idle.</p>

<h4 id="september-hello-world">September: hello world!</h4>

<p>September marked the arrival of our new son Victor into the world.
I learned that <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/new-parent-again/">being a parent is easier the second time around</a>—except
for the <em>other</em> kid.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/new-parent-again/victor-sleep.jpg" alt="Hello Victor"></p>

<p>Our new son Victor, born September 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on paternity leave I stumbled upon a diagram labeled as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">Ikigai</a>—that 
I later learned was <em>not</em> Ikigai—that made me question about my chosen career.</p>

<p>Specifically, I felt like I was doing well with everything <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/ikigai/">except possibly “what the world needs”</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/not-ikigai.jpg" alt="Not Ikigai"></p>

<p>This diagram, often attributed as the Japanese concept of Ikigai, was actually
created by <a href="https://twitter.com/cosmograma">Andrés Zuzunaga</a>.</p>

<p>So, I devoted a chunk of the last three months of the year to trying to explore the topic of a “meaningful” life
and career more seriously.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/how-to-save-the-world/">turns out this is hard</a>!</p>

<p>I’ll let you know if I figure it out.</p>

<h4 id="november-another-record-breaking-month">November: another record-breaking month</h4>

<p>Back on the business-side of things, at the end of November, I ran an impulse Black Friday sale,
leading to another record-breaking month for Pegasus and 
me—outstripping my previous monthly high by almost $3,000.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/total-profits-social.png" alt="Black Friday"></p>

<p>The massive spike from the Pegasus Black Friday sale. November, 2020.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">my write-up on the sale</a> made 
the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, resulting in about 10,000
visitors to my website and leading to another few Pegasus sales.</p>

<p>After the whole saga, I was suddenly within reach of my 2020 profit target of $42k that
I’d all-but abandoned post-Covid.</p>

<h4 id="december-rr">December: R&amp;R</h4>

<p>Finally, rounding out the year amidst another Covid surge and lockdown in South Africa
with the family and some time off.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/family-holidays.jpg" alt="Family Holidays"></p>

<p>While alcohol sales are again closed in South Africa, at least the national parks are open. December, 2020.</p>

<h2 id="profits">Profits</h2>

<p>When all was said and done, <strong>total profits on the year from personal projects came in just over $43,000</strong>—or
about $1k higher than <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/master-plan/">my goal set in January</a>.
Given how hard the pandemic hit Place Card Me, I’m quite proud to have still hit that target.</p>

<p>Here’s the last four years of product income—broken out by product.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/profits-by-year.png" alt="Profits by year"></p>

<p>Annual profits by product. Now available on my <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/">side-project dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>Place Card Me ended up down about 42% on the year, but Pegasus more than made up for it,
growing from $4,000 to almost $30,000 in a single year—or about <em>double</em> 
what I had forecasted at the start of the year.</p>

<p>More on this later.</p>

<h2 id="time-spend">Time spend</h2>

<p>I logged just under 2,000 hours this year. 
This works out almost exactly to a standard 40-hour-a-week, 52-week work-year,
which makes it easier to think about the time distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/2020/2020-time.png" alt="2020 time"></p>

<p>In terms of a calendar year breakdown, about four months went to my day job at Dimagi,
three months went to Pegasus, six weeks went to email and writing,
another five weeks went to exercise(!), and then the rest fell into smaller buckets.</p>

<p>I’m happy with this breakdown, though I would prefer if the amount of “day job” time was a bit
less and the amount of “exploration” time was a bit more.
Something to think about for 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="the-year-ahead">The year ahead</h2>

<p>If 2020 was the year of Pegasus then 2021 will be the year of…well…also Pegasus.</p>

<p>Yep, for the third year running, <strong>I’m planning for Pegasus to be my main hustle</strong>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p><em>Because it still feels like Pegasus is in its first act</em>.</p>

<p>A year into Place Card Me the product felt basically complete.
I could add features, improve marketing, etc. but there weren’t any easy ways to grow it without 
fundamentally changing the product in some way.
Place Card Me made place cards well. Where do you go from there?</p>

<p>Pegasus on the other hand, seems to have limitless possibility.
The core product itself can continue getting better, with lots of features to add and improvements to 
make—some of which are already in flight. Plus, it’s fun as hell.</p>

<p>But even Pegasus itself is just the beginning.</p>

<p>Could Pegasus have a plug-in marketplace where other developers can earn money extending it?
Could Pegasus have a jobs board to connect Django developers to my customers who need help on their projects?
Could Pegasus offer Django courses or books?
Or a hosted way to deploy your Django apps to the cloud?</p>

<p>Much like <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/183-chris-oliver-of-gorails">Chris Oliver has done for Ruby on Rails</a>, 
there appear to be an infinite amount of Pegasus-adjacent opportunities to create new products, offerings,
and build out the Pegasus ecosystem—all of which are aligned with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah. Already my most profitable product by a lot and still in act one.
Hopefully exciting times ahead!</p>

<h2 id="2021-targets">2021 Targets</h2>

<p>The other big decision I’ve made about 2021 is that it’s time to flip the narrative 
of what I’ve been doing.</p>

<p>For the last four years I’ve thought of myself as a professional developer/freelancer who also played around
on the internet trying to make money from side-hustles.</p>

<p>But barring an unexpected turn of events—<em>I expect 2021 to be the first year I make
the majority of my income from my own businesses</em>.
A change I hope just might hold for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>the side hustles have become the main hustle.</em>
<strong>I’m no longer a <em>side-project</em> entrepreneur. I’m a mother-fucking <em>real entrepreneur</em>.</strong></p>

<p>So, here are my targets for 2020:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Earn $65k Profit from personal projects.</li>
  <li>Spend the majority of my time working for myself.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time to own this thing!
I’m looking forward to it.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Societies have long valued information control but methods of control have changed over time. What systems drive these changes? And where do undesirable outcomes occur?</p>
<p>Using any of these methods doesn’t imply bad intentions. In some cases, there are good reasons for wanting to control information. But if we’re thinking only of intentions, we’ll lose our focus on outcomes. <strong><a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/morals-of-the-moment/">Good intentions</a> can lead us down bad pathways</strong>.</p>
<p>Four major types of control information are destruction, banning, debauching, and blocking.</p>
<p>These methods are applied to recorded information as well as what we carry in our memories and pass down verbally.</p>
<p>And why do I care about this?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png" alt="" width="550" height="271" srcset="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types.png 876w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-300x148.png 300w, https://unintendedconsequenc.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Information-Control-four-types-768x378.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><span id="more-2793"></span></p>
<h2>Destroy</h2>
<p>When we think of the topic of information control, we might naturally think of destruction. But <strong>destruction is a small part</strong> of this issue today.</p>
<p>Many of the best examples of destruction are from long ago.</p>
<p>China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang Di, ordered the burning of books (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars">213 BC</a>) that existed before his reign so that he could not be compared with times of the past. As the Qin emperor’s chancellor is recorded as saying: <em>“Anyone who uses history to criticize the present shall have his family executed.”</em> The Qin emperor did however allow books on certain topics to survive, including&nbsp; agriculture and medicine.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae">damnatio memoriae</a> (the erasure of specific villains from history) served both as punishment and to prevent others from committing similar acts.</p>
<p>Note that destroying information was more possible in the past. When much information was handwritten, not easily replicable or distributed, and in limited quantities, outright destruction was a serious option. Destruction became less of an option after the development of the printing press, online distribution and historical backups, and more.</p>
<h2>Ban</h2>
<p><strong>Banning often comes from a entity’s decision that certain information is contrary to their aims</strong>. Information may be banned because it is bad for morals, is believed to create bad feelings, may harm the people who should be protected from it, or may harm the group banning it.</p>
<p>Books form some of the better known types of banned content. There are too many banned books to list.</p>
<p>Germany in the leadup to WWII started to burn and ban books and other works of art, building a “list of harmful and undesirable literature” with <a href="https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/berlin-im-nationalsozialismus/verbannte-buecher/#headline_1_2">4,500 works</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the more famous books banned at one time in the US (with their reasons) include: <em>Brave New World</em> (sex, drugs, morals), <em>Animal Farm</em> (politics on multiple sides), <em>Catch-22</em> (profanity), <em>Of Mice and Men</em> (profanity, racial slurs), <em>Lord of the Flies</em> (morals, racism), <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> (sex, profanity, morals), <em>Invisible Man</em> (sex), <em>Satanic Verses</em> (blasphemy).</p>
<p>Bans also depend on timing. The Catholic Church (in an era of weakness due to the Protestant Reformation) banned Galileo’s works on the heliocentric solar system, but not Copernicus’ supporting work that predated it (in an era of a strong church).</p>
<p>In <em>The Republic </em>Plato even concerns himself in which types of music to ban. A dialogue in Book III outlines the types of music that should be allowed in an ideal city. Ban the dirges, ballads, and drinking songs; keep the marches.</p>
<p>A ban keeps information out, whether from a geographic area, an age group, a religious group, or political one. Bans don’t affect the existence of that information or its presence in other groups. <strong>The groups enforcing the ban are typically open about their reasons</strong>.</p>
<h2>Block</h2>
<p><strong>Groups understand the risk of allowing certain information to flow.</strong> Blocking is a more sophisticated version of banning. Where you might make a list of books that are to be banned, you never could do the same with the volume of user generated content created today.</p>
<p>Examples of blocking includes censorship during wartime. The lack of censorship in Spain (neutral during WWI) is why even today we refer the 1918 flu pandemic as the “Spanish Flu.” Spain was one of the few countries with reporting on the new disease.</p>
<p>Wartime censorship was also on an individual basis, scanning letters to prevent the flow of sensitive information. This exchange on WWII censorship from <em>Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! by </em>Richard Feynman shows how it sometimes worked:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Next day I get a letter from my wife that says, ‘It’s very difficult writing because I feel that the _____ is looking over my shoulder.’ And where the word was there is a splotch made with ink eradicator.<br>
“So I went down to the bureau, and I said, ‘You’re not supposed to touch the incoming mail if you don’t like it. You can look at it, but you’re not supposed to take anything out.’<br>
“They said, ‘Don’t be ridiculous. Do you think that’s the way censors work — with ink eradicator? They cut things out with scissors.’<br>
“I said OK. So I wrote a letter back to my wife and said, ‘Did you use ink eradicator in your letter?’ She writes back, ‘No, I didn’t use ink eradicator in my letter, it must have been the _____’ and there’s a hole cut out of the paper.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But today there are also subtler means of blocking, for example pushing information down to page two of Google, releasing information on a holiday when there will be a little attention or, as Youtube is now doing, blocking content related to <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election">election fraud</a>.</p>
<p>The largest public version of this is China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a>, which blocks specific external sites and user-generated content.</p>
<p>Blocked information, when known, can also backfire. Those blocked Trump tweets related to the election may have caused more people to believe them than <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-social-media-fact-check-farce-11606519380?mod=e2two">otherwise</a>.</p>
<p>Blocking can also be self-propagating. When people learn what information will be blocked, they may self-censor themselves both in posting about it and searching for it.</p>
<h2>Debauch</h2>
<p><strong>Information debauch sets out to change the information for a specific purpose.</strong> Perhaps in our modern belief in openness, this technique has become more common.</p>
<p>The purpose could be to harm a opponent, for example by exaggerating a quote taken out of context or preventing specific information from reaching an audience by altering it. I’ve written about <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">disinformation</a> variations of this.</p>
<p>There are different types of information debauch. One is the Cardinal Richelieu style of inventing a crime in anything (<em>“If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged”</em>). The other is to <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/the-clip/">select an out-of-context clip</a> of a longer conversation when it agrees with your worldview (unintentional debauch) or supports your argument (intentional debauch).</p>
<p>The intentional misrepresentation of quotes fascinates me. People can go back to the primary source to see that the misquote is actually misleading, but few actually do that.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this related to Trump, both from him and targeted against him. To choose one of the more bizarre examples, debauched information led many people to believe that Trump recommended injecting or drinking bleach to treat COVID <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/11/joe-biden/no-trump-didnt-tell-americans-infected-coronavirus/">when he didn’t</a> (the light mentioned was apparently <a href="https://aytubio.com/healight/">this</a>). Few people view the original video or quotes in their entirety rather than only the retold story. When something is odd but believable, people will pass it along.</p>
<p><strong>You should not want debauched information even if it helps your side.</strong> Information debauch can be used in any direction. Making it a norm hurts the entire system.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I’ve written about information and how we use it multiple times on this site, in <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/question-of-timing/">A Question of Timing</a>,&nbsp; <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/disinformation-and-disease-coronavirus-edition/">Disinformation and Disease</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/prester-john-and-the-long-history-of-disinformation/">Prester John and the Long History of Disinformation</a>, <a href="https://unintendedconsequenc.es/acquiring-ignorance/">Acquiring Ignorance</a>, and other posts.</p>
<p>What unintended consequences can flow from each of these types of information control?</p>
<ul>
<li>Destroying: The loss of the information itself, historical value, missed links in human thought.</li>
<li>Banning: Possibly drawing more attention to the information than otherwise, bans can be found for contrary reasons.</li>
<li>Blocking: Does the controlling entity choose well?</li>
<li>Debauching: This technique brings doubt into other information, can be used in any direction, sows confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Controlling the flow and accuracy of information has long been essential. We are just in a stage of the world where information can flow fast and far and yet still be controlled in ways described above.</p>

<h2>Joy of Lisp.</h2>

<p>Ten years ago myself, Ray McDermott and Kristof Sajdak fell in love with functional programming; we marveled at its ease of expression, simplicity, and immutable data structures.</p>

<p>After reading the now classic <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf" title="[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>, this only made functional programming more attractive.  It seemed to be what we had been missing in the typical enterprise landscape, which at that time, was full of Java and .Net. It was a literal <em>where have you been all my life</em> moment as the beauty of it struck a chord with all of us.</p>

<p>From there, we never looked back – with our eyes now wide open, we had seen the promise of the future, and the current languages just wouldn’t cut it any longer.  Outside of our world, other factors that contributed to functional languages’ perfect timing for emergence included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moore’s Law was topping out</li>
<li>Lower cost multi-core CPUs were now mainstream</li>
<li>Parallel architectures were appearing, and</li>
<li>Jaded developers, were frustrated with their languages</li>
</ul>

<p>Martin Odersky’s Scala programming language was the subject of significant press attention and turned many people like us onto the possibility of using functional programming for the enterprise, but it wasn’t quite right, it was’t a Lisp.</p>

<h2>Hello Clojure.</h2>

<pre><code>(ns hello-clojure.core)
(defn -main [&amp; args]
    (println "Hello, Clojure!"=))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Around this same period, Rich Hickey’s Clojure came to our attention, with the simplicity of Lisp, a REPL, immutability and, critically, first-class host language interop. With Interop, we were no longer in a walled garden that restricted so many other, purer implementations. Rich’s pragmatic choices and the resultant capabilities of Clojure ticked all the boxes. It also seemed to do the impossible: re-invigorating and exciting the development teams.</p>

<p>We started using Clojure where we could and where it proved viable.  Areas where we identified uses were primarily in applications where there was little or no existing code in place and no overriding requirement to adhere to a corporate standard. No going back now, we were all in.</p>

<h2>Enter ClojureScript.</h2>

<pre><code>
(ns todomvc.views
  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]
            [re-frame.core :refer [subscribe dispatch]]
            [clojure.string :as str]))
</code>
</pre>

<p>ClojureScript goes everywhere; it can get to places that Clojure can’t go. It does this by piggybacking on the reach claim from JavaScript, and we can keep it functional.</p>

<p>We want our product to be able to reach any possible location, inside a car key fob, IoT devices, smart homes, and cities. ClojureScript is now mature enough to use everywhere, but it wasn’t always this way of course.</p>

<p>Looking back to 2010, I wanted to go way more mobile, and I had a desire to make the companies’ tech more ubiquitous for it to be deployed on iOS/Android/Tractors/Cars and we couldn’t do this in a functional programming way. Ray was using Clojure on Cloud PaaS and Web, continuing to leverage the JVM and Clojure to achieve great things.  Kristof and I worked on making connected cars “Restful” and idempotent, and JavaScript &amp; JSON made that happen for us; there just wasn’t a way to do this with functional programming.</p>

<p>As good as Clojure was we couldn’t use it where we wanted and felt like it was a vast chasm to cross for the reach that we desired to become a reality.</p>

<p>What we didn’t know then is that two future members of our team where actively solving this problem.</p>

<p>Mike Fikes built <a href="https://github.com/mfikes/goby" title="Goby" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goby</a>, a hybrid iOS app technology using ClojureScript and Objective-C and released it into the App Store. I understand that Facebook’s Lee Byron saw this, and it probably inspired Facebook towards going in this direction. Coincidently, David Nolen was asked by Facebook to speak at the React.JS conference around the same time. This led to both Mike and David being granted access to the React Native Github repository, which was closed to the public as it was still alpha.  Subsequently, Mike became the first person to get <a href="https://twitter.com/mfikes/status/573918846890938368?lang=en" title="ClojureScript working with React Native" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript working with React Native.</a></p>

<p>Separately &amp; together Mike and David worked on projects such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/" title="Om" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Om</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mfikes/ambly" title="Ambly" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ambly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/replete-repl/replete-ios" title="Replete" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Replete</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/planck-repl/planck" title="Planck" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planck</a></li>
<li>and of course the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript" title="ClojureScript" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClojureScript</a> compiler itself</li>
</ul>

<p>They blazed a trail that we now take for granted.</p>

<p>We came into Vouch with a long-held belief of consuming technology where no competitive advantage was needed and where differentiation is not a critical factor; this allows us to move quickly without us needing to become experts in commodity technologies.</p>
<p>Therefore we stand on the shoulders of many industry giants. Examples of this would be <a href="https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel" title="Figwheel" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figwheel</a>, created by Bruce Hauman, which has revolutionized the way we build UI, and Blockchain, and provided a way to create absolute trust.  To make our platform work with these great technologies, we needed flexibility and modularity for our technology.</p>

<p>Our approach has always been to use the right tool for the right job, first and foremost, it just so happens that that has been ClojureScript.</p>

<h2>Attracting World-Class Talent.</h2>

<p>We started Vouch with a core team, myself, Ray and Kristof, who had worked together for many years before Vouch.  We quickly came to a point where we needed to expand the development team with skilled engineers who shared our vision and passion for building the company we wanted to create.</p>

<p>A company’s product vision, culture, and outcomes are not the only considerations for attracting world-class engineers to join a team; technology choices are just as critical, which has been one of my maxims for success over the years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Great people want to work on great teams using great technologies, to build great products.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While our team shares a common interest in Clojure/ClojureScript, more importantly, we all wanted to work within a great team, using great technologies, to build great products.</p>

<p>The team is growing and attracting seriously world-class talent faster than we can onboard them.  It might just be the best problem I have ever had to solve for. Recently Mike commented, <em>“Wouldn’t it be great if we could build a team that could make all the tools we wanted to use to develop our products?”,</em> I could not have agreed more.</p>

<h2>Community.</h2>

<p>The Vouch team began getting deeper into the  Clojure community by first attending and then speaking at conferences. Ray started to host the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a>  podcast, which led to an introduction and later joining of Mike Fikes to the Vouch team.  Mike then introduced David Nolen who subsequently joined the team.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is here to stay, loved by the team and obviously, we have David and Mike who are the lead committers of the language and compiler respectively.  Ray hosts the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/defn" title="DEFN" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEFN</a> podcast and also started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UxEQuBvfLJgWR5tk_XIXA" title="Apropos" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apropos</a>. Our team speaks publicly and regularly at ClojureScript or related conferences. We invest in this language, we craft solutions using its strengths, we speak publicly about it, we educate people about it and most of all, we care for it.</p>

<h2>So are we actually betting the company on ClojureScript?</h2>

<p>In just 18 months with a small but highly skilled team, we have been able to conceive of, prototype, design, build and implement a breakthrough product that we believe will fundamentally alter the way that people, devices, software and processes interact digitally based on improving trust between those parties. I can honestly say that ClojureScript has been a substantial contributing factor to making this possible and in many ways, our product has become a poster child for the language.</p>

<p>ClojureScript is one of the most valuable tools available to us, and we use it where it makes sense to do so.  I’m not sure if we even consider this as a bet, but if it is, then it’s the safest bet we will ever make.</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

Therefore, the only sensible bet is to believe in God. This has come to be known as <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/why-pascals-wager-is-eminently-modern" target="_blank">Pascal’s wager</a>.</p><p>It has a surprising number of applications beyond concerns for a comfortable afterlife. There are many things for which the value of believing something or not can be seen as a cost-versus-likely-benefit wager,&nbsp;often without regard to the actual truth of the matter. Since science does not profess to have a final truth, and in many areas freely admits its incomplete knowledge, Pascal’s wager can provide a useful method of deciding between two alternatives.</p><blockquote><p>All drugs and treatments have side effects, but vaccines in general have the fewest.</p> </blockquote><p>For example, it seems that a significant percentage of the population is suspicious of science, or so we are told. We often hear that some large number, approaching or exceeding half of Americans, do not believe in evolution. This seems remarkable on the face of it because there is no viable scientific opposition to evolution and it is widely accepted by biologists and other life scientists as being fundamental to understanding biology—from genetics to medicine.<br></p><p>What we are not often told is that most of those who answer negatively about believing in evolution nonetheless understand evolution—or at least the basics of it. They are not stupid, ignorant, or uninformed. They have simply made a Pascalian wager. What benefit, we might ask, is derived from believing in evolution rather than a <a href="http://nautil.us/blog/how-to-weed-creationism-out-of-schools" target="_blank">divine creation</a>? Unless you are a professional biologist, it is hard to see how this would affect your everyday life. On the other hand, professing a belief in Darwinian evolution over the biblical narrative will likely ostracize you from family, friends, co-workers, your church community—in short most of your social infrastructure. Place your bets.</p><p>Can we apply any of this to decisions over the current controversy surrounding vaccination—and in particular the newly arrived COVID-19 vaccine?</p><p>There are certainly reasons to be concerned about being vaccinated, and it would be a gross over-simplification to consider anyone who expresses reticence about taking a vaccine, this new vaccine in particular, as being just plain dumb or scientifically illiterate or gullible. They need be none of these things and still may be suspicious of the vaccine.<br></p><p>One issue is safety. The vaccine, any vaccine, is designed to mobilize your immune system, essentially to fool it into believing that there is an invading virus present and to mount an immune response. That way it will be ready when the real invasion comes, if it comes. This seems pretty sensible and preferable to going to war with an opponent you know nothing about. But still, it is fooling around with Mother Nature and some people are uneasy about that. Although it must be pointed out that the virus is not at all shy about fooling around with your immune system and many other parts of you, so letting it have its way is not good policy, either.</p><p>What about a vaccine made of genes? This vaccine is being produced by what is being touted as a new method using RNA—genes. While it is true that for entirely economic reasons, this is the first vaccine to be produced in this way, the method is not really new and the science that makes it possible has been developing over the last 40 years. So it’s not so radical as the press makes it seem.&nbsp;</p><p>But it is true that this method uses RNA, genetic material, to make the vaccine. We hear a lot about gene modification and the potential dangers associated with it. Why then am I going to allow RNA, genes, to be injected into me? The first thing to realize is that this is exactly what the virus does—so whether you get a vaccine or an infection, you are getting genes injected into you. The virus RNA encodes around 12 functional genes (by comparison humans and other mammals have around 25,000 genes). The virus only contains the genes to make a new virus—it does not have any of the capabilities of a normal cell to actually turn those genes into the proteins that make up the complete virus. It hijacks your cells to do this—and that’s how it sickens you, by forcing your cells to make new viruses instead of what they should be doing.</p><blockquote><p>Vaccines have fewer side effects than virtually any other drug you wouldn’t even think twice about taking.</p> </blockquote><p>Now the new vaccines have taken just one of those genes—the one that directs the production of the now infamous spike protein that appears on the surface of a normal virus—and injects just that one gene into your muscle cells, which then make that one single protein. Your immune system comes along and sees that weird protein and makes antibodies to it. These same antibodies will now recognize the spike protein on the surface of any viral particles that invade your body. We have effectively turned the virus into its own enemy.</p><p>The viral RNA that you are getting will decompose over a few days because RNA is not a stable molecule (that, by the way, is why the vaccine needs to be kept frozen) and it will no longer exist in your body. It could only become a permanent part of your genome if it were a DNA molecule instead of an RNA molecule—and even the chances of that happening would be chemically remote. So regardless of how it sounds, this may actually be the safest sort of vaccine to use. In the future it is likely that all vaccines will be made this way.</p><p><span>T</span>hen, of course, there is the issue of who is running this whole vaccine program—the government and the pharmaceutical industry. These are the guys who brought you opioid addiction, death by Vioxx, soaring drug prices, the worst health-care system in the developed world, regulations where you don’t need them and none where you do—am I really going to trust this cast of so-called “inept villains,” as some believe, to dictate my personal health choices? Do we know for sure that the claims of efficacy are real or just made up to sell some worthless procedure? It would not be the first time. (I would not, on the other hand, worry about Bill Gates having a chip inserted into you along with the vaccine—if you use any social media, navigational tools, or purchase anything online, then Bill Gates already knows more about you than he will get from any injectable chip. So that train has left the station.)</p><p>All this and a few lesser issues are worth a pause, for sure. But we must also look on the positive side of the ledger. Why trust science? Modern medicine and the science behind it has eliminated or dramatically lessened such scourges as smallpox, polio, cholera, chicken pox, measles, rabies, and dozens of other killer pathogens that had previously wiped out enormous numbers of people, in some cases significant parts of entire generations. Don’t we depend on science for much of the comfort and safety of our everyday lives? Isn’t science the way we heat our homes, drive to work, fly around the world, have dependable food? Yes, there is the bomb—but there is also anesthesia.<br></p><div id="inpagesub">

</div><p>When it comes to viruses, the only tool we have to fight them is vaccination. The only tool. Antibiotics are for bacteria, a completely different sort of creature. Sanitation beyond personal hand-washing is ineffective. Vaccines trick the immune system into recognizing the virus earlier than it would otherwise and protect normal cells from invasion by the virus. Tricking the immune system is understandably problematic for people who believe that their body knows best if it’s just kept healthy. This virus, as we have seen from the array of infected people that includes apparently healthy folks, unfortunately does not subscribe to that belief.</p><p>By a similar sort of reasoning, some people make the plausible error of calculating that the vaccine is 95 percent effective but the survival rate is 99 percent, so why not just let my natural resistance take care of this? Indeed, that might not be unreasonable thinking if we were talking about the common cold, but this virus has shown itself to be a tricky character, and we are not yet able to predict who gets a serious case and who a mild one. With those sorts of stakes, you shouldn’t wager on either of those numbers because they have nothing to do with&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;as an individual. Like flipping a coin, there is only a 1 percent chance of it coming up heads 6 times in a row. But if it has come up heads 5 times in a row, the probability of it coming up heads on the next flip is…still 50/50.&nbsp;</p><p>An even larger unknown is whether there may be long-term effects associated with SARS-Cov-2, as is the case for many viruses. The 1918 influenza virus has been linked to a subsequent two-three fold increase in Parkinson’s disease by a mechanism we still don’t understand. The virus that gives children chicken pox will hide out in a person’s body for 40 years or more, and then emerge as a painful, sometimes debilitating, case of shingles. The 99 percent survivability rate of this virus is meaningless if, 20 years from now, it causes some devastating pulmonary or brain disease.</p><p>The main upside to vaccines is that because they use your already existing defense system, they are surprisingly safe. Safer than antibiotics, which have numerous side effects, because they are not part of our normal make up and are …</p></div></div>

The basic premise of this post is that a good telemetry library needs to be lightweight to avoid perturbing the application; inefficient diagnostic tools are self-defeating.
Unlike other formats, nested Protobuf messages cannot be written contiguously into a stream without significant buffering. 
The post doesn’t argue to never use Protobuf, but that the trade-off made by the <em>wire-format</em> itself, as opposed to any existing implementation, is unlikely to work for lightweight message senders.</p>

<h2 id="protobuf-java-is-a-little-heavy">Protobuf-java is a little heavy</h2>

<p>A few months ago I needed to become familiar with the Protobuf wire-format for a proof of concept.
The motivation for digging in to the wire-format, rather than just using <code>protobuf-java</code>, was the dimensions of the library, which I would need to bundle in an agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>stat</span> <span>-c</span> %s protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar
1672950

<span>$ </span>jar <span>-tf</span> protobuf-java-3.14.0.jar | <span>grep</span> <span>'.class'</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span>
669
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just depending on the library adds 1.6MB and nearly 700 classes before you even generate your own message classes.
Since the deployment in question was an agent which can’t assume the presence of <code>protobuf-java</code> at runtime, there is no way to avoid bundling the extra 1.6MB.
Since the aforementioned agent implements <code>ClassLoader</code> isolation to avoid interfering with application class loading, even if <code>protobuf-java</code> <em>is</em> present at runtime, the classes would need to be loaded again by an isolated <code>ClassLoader</code>.</p>

<p>A tracer only needs to <em>produce</em> messages, so not all of those 669 classes (which doesn’t include your own generated classes) will get loaded, but a lot of them do.
Having since implemented library-neutral Protobuf serialisation in Datadog’s <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java">sketches-java</a>, I have a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/sketches-java/blob/master/src/jmh/java/com/datadoghq/sketch/ddsketch/benchmarks/Serialize.java">point of comparison</a> to show how many classes get loaded in a write-only context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>@OutputTimeUnit</span><span>(</span><span>TimeUnit</span><span>.</span><span>MICROSECONDS</span><span>)</span>
<span>@BenchmarkMode</span><span>(</span><span>Mode</span><span>.</span><span>AverageTime</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Serialize</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BuiltSketchState</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>@Benchmark</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>serialize</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since I mention a Datadog library and am a Datadog employee, I make clear that none of the opinions presented in this post or elsewhere on this blog represent those of my employer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each method produces identical bytes, and the purpose of the benchmark above is to compare speeds.
One of the methods relies on a single class consisting of fewer than 150 lines of code, including white-space, whereas the other depends on a large library.
For the record, the hand-written method <code>serialize</code> above is roughly 10x faster than using <code>protobuf-java</code>, but it’s not the point of this post. 
By running the benchmark for a single warmup iteration each, with the argument <code>-jvmArgsPrepend "-verbose:class"</code>, the classes which are loaded are logged, which I captured in separate files.
276 more classes are loaded when using <code>protobuf-java</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> serialize.log 
1400 serialize.log
<span>$ </span><span>wc</span> <span>-l</span> to_proto.log 
1676 to_proto.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you work at a large organisation which has entirely embraced Protobuf, I would not suggest worrying about 1.6MB or a few hundred loaded classes; these costs quickly amortise as you use the library for more features.
However, your resource budget for a diagnostic agent which tells you what your application is doing and how it’s performing should be tiny, and I’m not sure <code>protobuf-java</code> can be made to fit in to it, given the isolation constraints for agents outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="length-delimiters-are-costly-to-produce">Length delimiters are costly to produce</h2>

<p>This meant that I needed to write my own (which is a lot easier than it sounds if you haven’t done this sort of thing before) so I had to read the only documentation there is on <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding</a>.
I couldn’t get the formatter I had written based on my first reading of this document to produce valid protobuf because I had skim-read the section on embedded messages, and because it includes a design decision that would never have occurred to me.
When I went back and read it again I was surprised to find that embedded messages are length-prefixed, but the length prefix is varint encoded, which means you don’t know how many bytes you need for the length until you’ve done the serialisation, and it’s recursive.</p>

<p>Length prefixes aren’t unusual in binary formats: BSON documents are prefixed by their sizes in bytes, meaning sub-documents need to be serialised recursively before their lengths can be written.
BSON makes this easy by not compressing the document length so you just leave 4 bytes for the length and come back and fill it in when popping document contexts (<a href="https://richardstartin.github.io/posts/shrinking-bson-documents">it can add up to a significant portion of your database though</a>).
Msgpack, for example, <em>does</em> apply prefix compression of embedded element lengths (e.g. maps and arrays) but the length is an element count, not a number of bytes, which makes streaming serialisation a lot easier to do.</p>

<p>Protobuf does both, and, consequently, there’s no way to produce nested Protobuf messages without doing something relatively expensive.
You must either maintain a stack and copy contents from frame to frame as they are popped, or pre-compute serialised lengths of nested elements recursively; it isn’t possible to simply write serialised output sequentially to a stream as it is with other formats. 
I abandoned the proof of concept when I found that a streaming zero-allocation msgpack codec I had written was around 6x faster than either <code>protobuf-java</code> or a handwritten Protobuf codec for messages with nesting.
Since I couldn’t remove the nesting in the messages I needed to produce, I blamed the wire-format and moved on.</p>

<p>People who actually know Protobuf already know this (it’s literally written in the encoding manual), and understand the benefits which arise from this cost elsewhere (e.g. implementing partial deserialisation is easy, easy to skip over sections of the message), but lots of people don’t seem to understand the cost model the wire-format imposes.
If they did, there would probably be a lot less nesting in Protobuf as used in the wild.</p>

<p>This more or less concludes my argument against using Protobuf for telemetry: if you find for yourself that producing Protobuf messages is costly, it’s not even a case of a third party library making the wrong trade-offs for your application; it’s the wire-format itself at fault.
If you want to ship telemetry data out of an application and aim to minimise the impact on the application, even if you implement your own zero-allocation, micro-optimised codec, you shouldn’t choose Protobuf.</p>

<p>This is a good opportunity to segue into describing the wire-format for Protobuf 3, filling in a couple of the gaps in <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">Google’s encoding document</a>, but read the official document if you want to write your own.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-the-wire-format">Notes on the wire format</h2>

<p>Protobuf’s wire format is really simple: it’s just a list of tagged key-value pairs. 
Since readers have a schema to refer to, ambiguity is permissible and advantageous.
The logical structure of a Protobuf message is as below, with each tag followed by some bytes associated with the tag.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>tag1:value1, tag3:value2, tag2:value3, ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is a pseudo-Backus-Naur form of the wire format.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>body 	         ::= 	tagged_value*
tagged_value     ::=    tag value
tag              ::=    varint((field_number &lt;&lt; 3) | wire_type)
wire_type        ::=    VARINT | FIXED_64 | LENGTH_DELIMITED | GROUP_BEGIN | GROUP_END | FIXED_32
VARINT           ::=    0
FIXED_64         ::=    1
LENGTH_DELIMITED ::=    2
GROUP_BEGIN      ::=    3 (deprecated)
GROUP_END        ::=    4 (deprecated)
FIXED_32         ::=    5
value            ::=    varint | fixed_64 | length_delimited | fixed_32
fixed_64         ::=    double | long
length_delimited ::=    varint(N) byte{N}
fixed_32         ::=    float | int
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Each data item has a tag, which contains the field number (as defined in the .proto file) and one of the four wire types still in use in Protobuf 3.
The tag is constructed by shifting the field number left by three bits and combining with the wire type, and then <em>varint-encoded</em> so it takes up less space.
Since there are only three bits for the wire type, there can only ever be eight wire types, and two have already been wasted on group begin and end markers (I don’t know the story behind these).
Given that <code>FIXED_32=5</code> with only two possible wire types left, I imagine that there were some tense meetings before deciding to add it.</p>

<p>The terminology above is my own, but notice that there are no terms like <code>repeated</code>, <code>oneof</code>, or <code>message</code>.
This is because they don’t exist at this level. 
<code>message</code> is just a length delimiter followed by some more protobuf, preceded by a <code>LENGTH_DELIMITED</code> tag; the schema has the necessary information to read the raw bytes.
<code>repeated</code> fields come in two kinds: packed and not packed. 
Packed <code>repeated</code> fields are indistinguishable from a <code>message</code> or a <code>string</code> on the wire.
<code>repeated</code> fields which aren’t packed are a list of tag-values with the same field number and the element type in each tag, and they don’t need to be contiguous within the message.
Incidentally, writers aren’t obliged not to repeat non-<code>repeated</code> fields, and as there is nothing to distinguish these fields over the wire, readers are obliged to take the <em>last value</em> for a non-<code>repeated</code> field (which makes some of the partial deserialisers I’ve seen illegal).</p>

<p><code>FIXED_32</code> corresponds to proto types <code>float</code>, <code>fixed32</code>, and <code>sfixed32</code>, whereas <code>FIXED_64</code> corresponds to <code>double</code>, <code>fixed64</code>, and <code>sfixed64</code>.
All other integers, which includes booleans, are <em>varint</em> encoded, which has the basic effect of removing leading zeros in order to save space.
Starting with the least significant bits, seven bits are taken at a time from the integer until no bits remain, and all but the last byte have their most significant bit set.
This allows the parser to detect the end of an integer by looking for a byte with the MSB unset. 
Whilst this saves space, it …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the beginning of the corona pandemic, I work from home. This means my MacBook is constantly connected to the charger. For Lithium-Ion batteries, it's not healthy to remain charged at 100% all the time. I first noticed that there's a problem when my trackpad wasn't clicking properly anymore. Upon inspection with a ruler, I noticed that the keyboard was curved because the battery had swollen. To replace the swollen battery, the entire Topcase had to be replaced.</p>
<p>To avoid this from happening again, I started looking for a way to control the charging behavior of my MacBook.</p>
<p>In Mac OS Catalina 10.15.5, Apple has introduced a new feature called <code>Battery Health</code>. It is found under <code>System Preferences &gt; Energy Saver</code>. Apple describes the feature as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The battery health management feature in macOS 10.15.5 is designed to improve your battery's lifespan by reducing the rate at which it chemically ages. The feature does this by monitoring your battery's temperature history and its charging patterns.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the measurements that it collects, battery health management may reduce your battery's maximum charge when in this mode. This happens as needed to ensure that your battery charges to a level that's optimized for your usage-reducing wear on the battery, and slowing its chemical aging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does that mean exactly? The description in the System Preferences is a bit clearer:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>According to this message, OS X will start reducing the maximum charge of the battery when it ages, to extend its lifespan. In my tests, it drained the battery a bit after being plugged in for a while and then recharged it back to 100%. Since my battery health is still high, it didn't reduce the maximum charge even after being plugged in for multiple days.</p>
<p>This wasn't what I was looking for. I wanted to control the maximum charge level myself before the battery was degraded. Lenovo and Tesla are both offering such a feature out of the box, Apple doesn't. Luckily there's a free tool that allows you to take control over the maximum charge level.</p>
<p> <strong>AlDente</strong> gives you the possibility to set a maximum charge level for your MacBook. The tool itself writes this value to the SMC of your MacBook. Most likely it's just using the same feature OS X is using, just more explicitly.</p>

<h2>How to install AlDente</h2>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/davidwernhart/AlDente/releases" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AlDente's Github Page</a> and download the latest release. Then unzip the archive and move <code>AlDente.app</code> to your Applications folder.</p>
<p>Upon opening, you'll probably get a message like <code>AlDente cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>. To work around this, right-click on the application and click <code>Open</code>:</p>

<p>When you start AlDente for the first time, it will ask you to install its helper tool. This is required for AlDente to be able to write the SMC value as root.</p>
<p>Once the app is running, set the value to the maximum you desire. I would recommend a value between <strong>60 and 80 percent</strong> - I chose 70 percent as my sweet spot.</p>
<p>After that, you need to reboot to ensure the value is taken into account. If your battery is currently above your threshold, you'll have to unplug your MacBook, drain it below the threshold and then plug it back in. Once your defined maximum is reached, it will stop charging and display <code>Not Charging</code>.</p>

<h2>How Neobanks Should Monetize Status Signaling</h2>



<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you probably know by now that one of my favorite topics to think and write about is “status signaling”.</p>



<p>Signaling explains most of our everyday actions: what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling-as-a-Service</a>, I described the implications signaling has on the monetization of software businesses. For many traditional industries, monetizing the display of status is not a new concept. A Rolex watch, for example, is not better at telling the time than a cheap Casio watch. But a Rolex reveals something about its owners’ wealth and, thus, their status in society. It’s that status message that explains the difference in price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/equaltime.png"></p><p>Similarly, driving a Prius says something about your views on climate change. A <em>Make America Great Again</em> cap reveals something about your political affiliations. And Nike athletic wear signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle.</p>



<p>Software is at a crucial disadvantage compared to these physical products because of its intangibility. A fitness app also signals a healthy, pro-active lifestyle, but no one can see it because it only lives on your phone. Everyone can see your Nike gear whenever you wear it in public. Software can’t offer the same benefit. It doesn’t have a signaling distribution channel.</p>



<p>This is why there is no software equivalent of a Rolex watch or a Louis Vuitton handbag. People aren’t willing to spend money on things other people can’t see they spent money on.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. As software is eating the world, the lines between physical and digital products are becoming increasingly blurry. As I have pointed out in my original essay, one way for software companies to solve the signaling distribution problem is to add a physical element to their software product.</p>



<p>In this post I want to explore this idea a little bit further. Specifically, we’ll look at neobanks – and their opportunity to monetize credit card signaling.</p>



<p><span>02</span> Neobanks</p>



<p>In the last couple of years we have witnessed the birth and rise of a new startup vertical: neobanks.</p>



<p>Neobanks differ from traditional banks in two ways:</p>



<p>1) Rather than relying on a physical branch network, the entire banking experience is managed via an app</p>



<p>2) Instead of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-q4bEULG64">“how do you do, fellow kids”</a>-cringiness that ad campaigns of traditional banks usually invoke when they try to appeal to a younger audience, neobanks are actually perceived as cool. In fact, many of them feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1_26qGBSGmB3yaPD7nZJrFIg.gif">



<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lifestylebrand-1.png"></p><p>Interestingly though, neobanks still use one very traditional banking element: physical cards.</p>



<p>At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive. If you are building a mobile-first bank, why not offer virtual cards and let users pay with their phone? Why go through the hassle of producing and shipping physical cards?</p>



<p>The answer is – you guessed it – signaling.</p>



<p>Think about it: Paying for things (offline) is a social activity. It’s an interaction between at least you and a cashier or waiter. But ideally, in a dinner scenario for example, you are surrounded by other people you want to impress: a date, a group of friends, or work colleagues.</p>



<p>This makes the moment you take out your card to pay the bill a great opportunity to make a statement and build social capital.</p>



<p>If you look at neobanks out there today, it’s pretty obvious that signaling is in fact one of the main benefits they offer – and almost the only thing they monetize <span>(apart from interchange, of course)</span>:</p>



<ul><li>The premium subscriptions neobanks offer usually don’t win on features but solely on nicer looking cards. The <a href="https://n26.com/metal">N26</a> or <a href="https://revolut.com/metal">Revolut</a> Metal plans, for example, don’t offer any additional features that <em>really</em> justify the ~€15 / month price tag. They do include a nice looking metal card though – that’s what people pay for.</li><li>Relatedly, it seems like most of the innovation in the industry is happening in card design. The actual banking products are more or less interchangeable, what differs is whether the card comes in <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">titanium</a>, <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">wood</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832">glow-in-the-dark yellow</a>.</li><li>You may have noticed that the credit card number has moved from the front to the back of the card. This makes it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.</li></ul>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nocardnumber-1.png"></p><p>Neobanks are popping up like mushrooms after the rain at the moment and it’s unlikely that this trend will end any time soon. Thanks to banking-as-a-service providers, we’ll likely see a lot of non-banking-companies add banking functionalities and cards to their product offering.</p>



<p>There’s an old Twitter joke that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a chat app. The 2020 version of that joke is that every app evolves until it eventually becomes a bank.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1295024066869567488">I did some research on credit card designs</a> recently, I was surprised by the sheer amount of different neobanks already in existance. And yet, even though almost all of them offer well-designed cards, it’s shocking how similar they all are. It seems like all of them are focusing on the same target audience instead of differentiating their signaling messages.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>03</span> In-Groups, Out-Groups and Artificial Scarcity</p>



<p>In every signaling scenario there are two possible target audiences: An in-group and an out-group.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/groups.png"></p><p>The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90391587/why-we-dont-want-you-and-your-android-green-bubbles-in-our-imessage-chat">iMessage is a great illustration of this</a>: the chat bubble colors clearly indicate who belongs to the in-group (blue = iOS) and who is part of the out-group (green = Android). </p>



<p>It’s important to note that signaling in iMessage is limited to the in-group since these color codes are only visible for iOS users – Android users can’t see who in the group is using which operating system. </p>



<p>Signaling, however, grows stronger the larger the out-group is – as long as the out-group knows about the in-group. This is why luxury car manufacturers deliberately extend their advertising campaigns to people who will never be able to afford their cars: they are increasing the size of the out-group by educating people about the in-group.</p>



<p>At the same time, brands need to control the size of the in-group. The more exclusive the in-group, the higher the signaling strength and, thus, the monetization potential of a customer. </p>



<p>The easiest control mechanism for the size of the in-group is price. If you set the price high enough, few people will be able to afford the product. Ironically, this, in turn, justifies the high price.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/priceloop.png"></p><p>Alternatively, companies create artificial scarcity by setting a hard number on supply. Limited supply creates FOMO and hype which increases the size of the out-group and results in higher social status for members of the in-group. Artificial scarcity explains the price of Bitcoin, Pokémon trading cards and why people spend hours queuing in front of Supreme shops.</p>



<p>The problem with keeping the in-group small is that it also limits the number of potential customers and, thus, overall revenue potential. Companies need to walk a fine line between maximizing the number of customers while simultaneously maximizing the number of people they can (afford to) exclude.</p>



<p><span>04</span> What Neobanks Should Build</p>



<p>The problem with neobanks today is that they all focus on the same in-group. Here are the premium cards of some of the largest European challenger banks – notice any difference?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/metalcards.png"></p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to become the Apple of Banking – including <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple itself</a>. The signaling messages are all about displaying economic power.</p>



<p>But we are slowly seeing new banking apps that are focusing on different audiences. For example, there are now a <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/">handful of</a> <a href="https://blog.gohenry.com/uk/gohenry-news/meet-our-new-biodegradable-eco-card/">“green”</a> <a href="https://www.treecard.org/">neobanks</a> that help users signal environmental altruism. </p>



<p>Or how about <a href="https://www.razer.com/razer-card">this Razer Card</a> targeted at the gamer community?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/environment.png"></p><p>The question for these companies and their investors is whether the in-group is big enough to justify building an entire bank around it. Making the unit economics of a bank work requires a certain amount of users, but as we discussed earlier, the signaling strength decreases as the size of in-group increases.</p>



<p>So how do you solve this problem?<br>By introducing multiple in-groups.</p>



<p>See, the current model looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup01.png"></p><p>(In fact, given how undifferentiated most of the offerings and cards are, there are actually multiple neobanks within the same small in-group bubble.)</p>



<p>But what if one bank would target multiple, different in-groups?</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neogroup02.png"></p><p>For example, what if N26 had dedicated cards for soccer fans, hip-hop enthusiasts and gamers? Instead of focusing on just one signaling audience, their total addressable market would massively increase. </p>



<p>The way they would target these audiences is via brand collaborations. N26 does not have the necessary reputation in any of the above-mentioned areas to build credible signaling messages. It would not be able to build attractive in-groups on its own – but other brands could lend N26 their social capital. </p>



<p>Apple has long worked with <a href="https://www.apple.com/lae/product-red/">RED</a>, IKEA recently <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/virgil-abloh-ikea-collaboration-best-look/">teamed up with Virgil Abloh</a>, and <a href="https://www.headspace.com/partners/nike-partnerships">Nike partners with Headspace</a>. Why wouldn’t this concept work for neobanks?</p>



<p>What would <strong>N26 x Manchester United</strong> look like? <br>Or <strong>Chime x Supreme</strong>? <br>Or <strong>Revolut x 100 Thieves</strong>?</p>



<p>Because of a bigger target audience overall, individual in-groups could be kept smaller. Cards could be <a href="https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/scarcity-as-an-api">released as limited edition drops</a> transforming them into collectibles, which would justify a higher price tag per card.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that different signaling audiences are not mutually exclusive. We don’t just subscribe to a single in-group – our <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/09/25/is-this-real-life/">identities are prismatic</a>. This means that some users might …</p></div></div>

    <p>The idea of this post is to introduce and discuss several interesting research programs from the past decade. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_program">research program</a> (or programme) refers to a common thread of research that shares similar assumptions, methodology, etc. The list below contains a variety of research programs: some on topics that have broad appeal e.g. <a href="#machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">explainable machine learning</a> and <a href="#the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">mental disorder</a>; others moved the direction of entire industries e.g. advances in <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">computer vision</a> and <a href="#blockchains-and-cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>; and others still are more niche areas that I happen to be deeply interested in e.g. <a href="#topological-learning-theory">topological learning theory</a>, <a href="#privacy-attacks-on-machine-learning-models">privacy attacks on ML models</a>, and <a href="#the-graph-theoretic-approach-to-epistemic-justification">graph-theoretic approaches to epistemology</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously, a list of this variety can never be complete and is surely biased by what I happen to be reading. If I’ve missed something interesting that you enjoy, let me know at <a href="mailto:brettcmullins@gmail.com">brettcmullins@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="image-recognition-and-object-detection">Image Recognition and Object Detection</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is difficult for me to begin this list without first talking about the area that most affected my professional career, led to (or at least accelerated) a boom in data science, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/neural-net-history">potentially thawed an AI winter</a>. During the 2010s, <a href="https://bmk.sh/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/">deep learning made enormous progress</a> in heuristics and applications. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a> in particular, a good starting point is <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf">AlexNet</a> in 2012 which used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional neural network (CNN)</a> architecture to substantially surpass existing benchmarks for image recognition - the task of assigning a label such as <em>cat</em>, <em>dog</em>, or <em>tree</em> to an image - on the <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet dataset</a>. Over the next few years, improvements would continue with architectures such as <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vgg-neural-networks-the-next-step-after-alexnet-3f91fa9ffe2c">VGG</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">ResNet</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf">Inception</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>With progress being made with recognition, other tasks such as object detection - finding and labeling objects (sometimes multiple objects) within images - became more feasible. One approach to object detection introduced in 2013 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524">Regional CNNs (or R-CNNs)</a> combined a model that first produced promising bounding boxes then utilized the newly developed recognition models (starting with AlexNet) to classify or label the regions in the bounding boxes. Over the next few years, progress in this direction was realized with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Fast R-CNN</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083">Faster R-CNN</a>. These frameworks not only employed better recognition models and found better bounding boxes, but they integrated the model components together so that they could be more efficiently trained or tailored to one’s application. <a href="https://blog.athelas.com/a-brief-history-of-cnns-in-image-segmentation-from-r-cnn-to-mask-r-cnn-34ea83205de4">Here is an excellent overview</a> of these models with a bit more detail.</p>

<p>Accompanying these new techniques and improvements was a large amount of software - with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffe_(software)">Caffe</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)">Torch</a> at first then the more user friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras">Keras</a> - allowing anyone to implement these models for their use cases. It’s also worth mentioning the proliferation of online courses such as <a href="https://fast.ai/">fast.ai’s</a> <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> that facilitated getting potential users up to speed to test out and deploy these tools.</p>

<h2 id="topological-learning-theory">Topological Learning Theory</h2>
<hr>

<p>Topological Learning Theory is the mathematical study of the learnability/solvability of hypotheses/problems that is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory">theory of computation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_set_theory">descriptive set theory</a> rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference">classical statistics</a> (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory">statistical learning theory</a>). The idea of learning theory is to analyze the learnability of hypotheses as one incrementally receives information about the true state of the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3858127/pexels-photo-3858127.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;dpr=2&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" width="200" height="350"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/learning-formal/#1.1">classic example</a> is to consider an ornithologist observing the color of ravens as, say, black or not. With each raven observed, the ornithologist gains information which rules out some hypotheses but is consistent with others. By coding a black raven as 1 and other ravens as 0, we can mathematically represent possible observation histories as infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, i.e. points in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_space">Cantor space</a>. The crux of this approach is that the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/jsr25/Spring_11/Lecture_Notes/dst_lecture_notes_2011_lec_2.pdf">topology on the Cantor space and other such spaces</a> naturally <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/kelly/learnreview.pdf">encodes the idea of information accumulation</a>. By considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_hierarchy">descriptive complexity of hypotheses</a>, identifying a hypothesis with the set of sequences that make it true, we can say things about the learnability of the hypothesis. For instance, the hypothesis “all ravens are black” is the set containing the single sequence of all 1s. We say that this hypothesis is falsifiable since if there is a non-black raven our ornithologist will eventually observe it; however, it is verifiable not in finite time but in the limit since the hypothesis is never conclusively true after any finite number of observations. This corresponds to the topological notion of properly being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%CF%83_set">$F_{\sigma}$ or $\Sigma^{0}_{2}$ set</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/kevin-kelly.html">Kevin Kelly’s</a> 1996 <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-logic-of-reliable-inquiry-9780195091953?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Logic of Reliable Inquiry</em></a> has been an authoritative text on formal learning theory in the Cantor space and other <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Polish+space">Polish spaces</a>. Advances in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computable+analysis">computable analysis</a> beginning in the early 2000s have enabled the extension of these classical formal learning theory results to a more general topological setting throughout the 2010s. The paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540109001631?via%3Dihub"><em>Topological Properties of Concept Spaces</em></a> from 2010 is the first to connect these computable analysis results to learning theory. By 2015, a pair of papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07518"><em>On the Solvability of Inductive Problems</em></a> and <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/TARK2015-proceedings.pdf#page=119"><em>Theory Choice, Theory Change, and Inductive Truth-Conduciveness</em></a> - both presented at the <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/tark/tark15.html">TARK 2015 conference</a> - provide complete topological characterizations of learnability/solvability in the limit as well as connections to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-belief-revision/">belief revision theory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Ockham’s Razor</a> in this more general topological setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-disordered-mind-theory-of-mental-illness">The Disordered Mind Theory of Mental Illness</h2>
<hr>

<p>In a series of articles and books over the past decade, the philosopher <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/george-graham">George Graham</a> develops a theory of mental disorder with the following qualities: 1. is non-reductionist with respect to the mind and the brain; 2. is informed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind">philosophy of mind</a>; and 3. coheres with the experiences of patients and clinicians. Graham’s theory holds that mental illness is distinct from somatic/bodily illness though may co-occur or otherwise be bound up with so-called <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07609-001">broken brains</a>. A helpful analogy for what is meant here by “the mental” or “the mind” is to view the brain as computer hardware, whereas the mind is software. On this picture, the mind and the brain are surely not independent; a hardware issue may impede the computation of some software. However, one may have bugs in one’s software - “gumming up the works” to use a common phrase of Graham - on perfectly functioning hardware.</p>

<p>This theory of mental disorder is developed in Graham’s text on mental illness in the context of the philosophy of mind: <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Disordered-Mind/Graham/p/book/9780367322328"><em>The Disordered Mind</em></a>. A follow-up book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-abraham-dilemma-9780198728658?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Abraham Dilemma</em></a>, refines this theory for the case of delusion, religious delusion in particular (I discuss <em>The Abraham Dilemma</em> in greater detail in my <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/top-books-2020/#the-abraham-dilemma-a-divine-delusion">Top Books in 2020</a>). Graham’s latest book <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/hearing-voices-and-other-matters-of-the-mind-9780190091149?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind</em></a> explores the unique properties and challenges of mental disorders in the presence of religious content. The disordered mind theory <a href="https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-disordered-mind-an-introduction-to-philosophy-of-mind-and-mental-illness/">is not without its detractors</a> who hold that Graham goes too far in arguing that one need not situate and commit to positions in the philosophy of mind to reject the complete reduction of mental illness to neuroscience.</p>

<p>I took George Graham’s seminar on Philosophy and Mental Illness in 2014 at <a href="https://philosophy.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a> and had several interesting chats with him about the metaphysics and definability of mental disorders.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-interpretability-and-explainability">Machine Learning Interpretability and Explainability</h2>
<hr>

<p>The boom in data science and widespread use of machine learning models during the past decade was accelerated by innovations in model architectures as well as tools and software to train and deploy these models. In addition to the <a href="#image-recognition-and-object-detection">progress with neural networks and deep learning</a>, algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost">XGBoost</a> allowed users to achieve state-of-the-art classification and regression performance without much effort. XGBoost in particular became so prevalent in both industry and ML competitions - as had logistic regression and other GLMs in the past - that it was not unreasonable for some to wonder whether or not <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d">we should just use XGBoost all the time</a>.</p>

<p>For all that these models gained in performance, they lost ground in being able to provide answers to questions from stakeholders, developers, and so forth when things went wrong as to why a model’s prediction was so far off or why does the computer vision model <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf">think a banana is a toaster</a>. Two approaches were offered as a solution (three if you count “Who cares?! Let’s do nothing!”): interpretability and explanations. The former offers constraints on model building such as limiting the number of features used and restricting to linear models so that the model is sufficiently simple to allow the developer/user to reliably predict the model’s behavior with a reasonable amount of effort. The latter is a set of methods for generating reasons for a model’s behavior for arbitrarily complex models. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03490"><em>The Mythos of Model Interpretability</em></a> is an early effort to disentangle these terms and map the landscape for understanding models. Also see <a href="https://bcmullins.github.io/economic_methodology_interpretable_ml_blackboxes/">my attempt here</a> as well as Christoph Molnar’s ever-evolving text <a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em></a>.</p>

<p><img width="40%" height="40%" src="https://bcmullins.github.io/images/blog/best_articles_2018/anchor.png"></p>

<p>The approach that I find the most compelling stems from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME paper</a>. LIME (or local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) is a method of generating an interpretable, i.e. linear, approximation of a model in the neighborhood of a given point in the feature space. This new model is then used to generate explanations by virtue of its interpretability. A second approach for classifiers called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf">Anchors</a> - both are developed by the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/group.html">same research group at UW</a> that also developed XGBoost - produces a simple region of the feature space (a rectangle) where the model’s prediction holds with high probability for a given point. This region or anchor acts as a sort of sufficiency condition for classification. The image to the right illustrates these ideas with the dotted line being a local linear approximation and the …</p></div></div>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies that law enforcement may use at protests and other public gathering to spying on people exercising their fundamental rights. Learn how to spot the surveillance so you can advocate effectively for the policies necessary to protect your rights and bring transparency to the police surveillance.</p>

<p>If you attend a protest, demonstration or any mass gathering in a public space, the police are probably surveilling you. Whether it’s sophisticated facial recognition, ubiquitous video recording, or the instant analysis of our biometric data, law enforcement agencies are following closely behind their counterparts in the military and intelligence services in acquiring privacy-invasive technologies, from automated license plate readers to body-worn cameras to drones and more.  In this talk, Kurt Opsahl with show you how to identify surveillance technologies in use:
<br>	• Where to look for these devices
<br>	• How these technologies look
<br>	• How these technologies function
<br>	• How they are used by police
<br>	• What kind of data they collect
<br>	• Where to learn more about them
<br>Knowledge is power. Knowing what technologies are in use can help you understand the threats to your privacy and security, as well as tools to advocate for limits on police use of surveillance that may chill people’s rights to express themselves on public issues.  Just as analog surveillance historically has been used as a tool for oppression, policymakers and the public must understand the threat posed by emerging technologies to successfully defend human rights in the digital age. </p>

<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=473">‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’</a> by Donald Knuth from 2001. Recommended reading if you like reading about how a world-renowned computer scientist wrote a book about how he wrote a book that deals with another book! Sounds recursive 😏</p>



<p>That last book is of course the bible and the book Knuth wrote about it is <a href="https://books.j11g.com/search.php?id=1">‘3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated ‘</a> — published in 1991. And in 1999 Knuth gave <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">a series of lectures at MIT</a> <em>‘on the general subject of relations between faith and science’.</em> In these lectures he explains how he went about writing this book and the thought process involved. So the lectures make for an enjoyable deep dive on creating such a book and how Knuth’s brain works, paired with discussions and insights on religion and things like eternity and finiteness.</p>



<p>And it is this series of lectures that are bundled together in ‘Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About’ — almost verbatim. But, the lectures have also always been available as audio files (sadly no visuals) on <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/things.html">Knuth’s homepage</a>. And I listened to those a few years back, and as I read this book I was reminded that I had created a RSS feed for these files, <strong>effectively creating a Knuth podcast!</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml"><img loading="lazy" src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.jpeg 1550w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></a><figcaption>This is a later picture of Donald Knuth and not from the 1999 lectures. I added the text, of course in the <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern">only possible font</a>.<br>(I have no copyright on this picture and couldn’t find out who did actually. Feel free to drop me a line if I can accredit you, or if you want it changed.)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I mostly created the file for myself to have the convenience of listening to the lectures in a podcast player. But I have also dropped the link to the XML file <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21967785">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19688748">there</a> over the years, and I noticed 607 <strong>unique</strong> IP addresses hit this link this month alone! There are only six lectures and one panel discussion and never any new content, so I am not sure what these numbers mean, if they mean anything at all. </p>



<p>But I also remembered I had never blogged about this, until now. So without further ado here is the link: </p>



<p><a href="https://j11g.com/knuth.xml">https://j11g.com/knuth.xml</a></p>



<p>You can add this to your favorite podcast player. I have added the feed to Overcast myself so <a href="https://piks.nl/upload/upload/_pn_2020-12-29_11-02-22.png">it looks like this</a> which is nice.</p>



<p>Having the audiofiles available in a podcast player enables you to track progress, speed up/down parts and have an <a href="https://twitter.com/OvercastFM/status/1223317202478211076">enhanced</a> audio experience.</p>



<p>I do remember writing an email (<a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">no hyphen</a>) to Knuth’s office and I received a nice reply that they thought it was <em>‘a great idea’</em>, and they were actually also thinking of starting their own podcast ‘<em>based on these materials’</em>. However I haven’t found any link to this yet, so for now it is just this.</p>



<p>If you are more into video, here is a great conversation Donald Knuth had with Lex Fridman last year. Published exactly a year ago to this day. The video is not embeddable but  you can click the image to go there. Recommended.</p>

<br/>
December 30, 2020 | https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://philippmuens.com/psychological-triggers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The triggers discussed in this post are powerful levers to influence peoples decision making processes. Never ever abuse this knowledge. Apply it in ethical ways and call out unethical usage when you spot it in the wild.</p>
<p>Your Landing Page is finally live and the metrics are promising but your conversion rates are still a little bit behind? It seems like there's some interest in your product but for some reason people aren't convinced enough to click that call-to-action.</p>
<p>Maybe you're running an ecommerce store and sales are great. But aren't there any tweaks you can apply to increase your sales even further?</p>
<p>Sometimes all that's necessary is a little nudge. In this blog post we'll examine what that nudge might be. How you can drive more attention towards action-taking rather than closing the browser tab and moving on. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2>Human needs</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is by no means a scientific write-up. If you're interested in the fascinating topic of Psychology I'd encourage you to pick up some legit literature such as "Thinking Fast and Slow" or to connect with an expert who majored in Psychology.</p>
<p>Before jumping right into the triggers, let's take a step back and understand why knowing the basics of human psychology is such an important and fascinating skill to possess.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything we do on a day-to-day is somehow influenced by our unconscious, the part of our being we cannot directly control. One of the many sources of information that has formed and still informs our unconscious is the basics of human behavior and desires. At the core, humans are very social beings. Forming tribes helped us survive and thrive in uncertain times. It's important for us to show that we're worthy being part of the tribe. Being an outsider by taking unapproved actions put oneself at huge risks and disadvantages. Risks that usually translated into pain and death. As it turned out, it made a whole lot of sense to play by the rules and adhere to the consensus.</p>
<p>Times have changed and nowadays there's a lot less risk involved when making decisions. However the tribal thinking is still deeply rooted in ourselves and therefore influences the actions we take.</p>
<p>Do you study reviews before buying products online? Do you browse through the comments on a YouTube video? Both of those actions are driven by the fact that we want to see what our peers are thinking and how they might think about us when we buy the item in question or like the videos content.</p>
<h2>The Triggers</h2>
<p>Now that we learned more about basic human needs and what drives us, it's time to take a deep dive into the different Psychological Triggers you can use to tap into those needs and nudge your visitors to take certain actions.</p>
<h3>1. Me vs. You</h3>
<p>To some extent, everyone is an egoist. While that might sound harsh it's a reality that people are obsessed with themselves. Knowing this puts you at a huge advantage because you can articulate your copywriting in a way that speaks directly to your users "self".</p>
<p>Don't talk about your company, the achievements and prizes you won. Don't write a wall of text outlining every single feature your product offers. Your company is in the business since the late 90s? Your app has a "dark mode"? That's all great but <strong>nobody really cares</strong>!</p>
<p>What matters are the benefits your users will experience when using your product. What are they dreaming about? What pain does your product address? How does your product help them live a better life? That's all that matters.</p>
<p>Update your copywriting to talk directly to your users rather than about you. Paint a picture of their dream and how your product helps them turn that dream into a reality.</p>
<h3>2. Making Progress</h3>
<p>There are only 9 pages left to complete the chapter in your favorite book? You only have to collect one more item to reach the next level in your favorite video game?</p>
<p>People love to make progress. It just feels good to take a project all the way from 0% to 100%. Even better if the progress is visualized and you can see the progress bar increasing with every little step of the way.</p>
<p>Use this love for progress in your products and services. Do you have a time-consuming onboarding process? Break it up into individual pieces and show a progress bar at the top of the page which updates as your users fill out the forms. Are you looking for more Newsletter sign ups? Display a "50% done" progress bar at the top of your Newsletter Form and call out that your visitor is "almost there".</p>
<p>Whenever you're looking for more commitment from your users, break the task down into individual pieces and add some information which makes it clear as to what the current status is and what is necessary to make progress.</p>
<h3>3. Time</h3>
<p>Time is one of the resources which cannot be created. Time will move on, no matter what you do. Given this, everyone values their time more than anything else.</p>
<p>There are a couple of different ways you can work with the "Time trigger".</p>
<p>The first one being to call out how much your product will help your users save time. Do you automate a time-consuming process? Do the math and clearly show your users how much time they'll save when they use your app. Time they can spend with their significant other or kids (you want to call that out as well).</p>
<p>Another usage of the "Time trigger" can often be found in conjunction with scarcity. "25% for the next 24 hours", "Registrations only open today". Those are the phrases you'll usually find on ecommerce stores or online course websites. You can do the same and offer time-bound discounts. If you do so, please make sure that your offer is legit. Use time and scarcity in a dishonest way and you'll immediately lose trust.</p>
<h3>4. Comparing and Contrasting</h3>
<p>The "Basic Plan" is 99 USD while the "Pro Plan" which has significantly more features is only 129 USD? Most people would pick the "Pro Plan" given that it has more features to offer. Even if those features will never be used. Looking at it through the lens of logic it doesn't really make sense to go with the "Pro Plan" if the "Basic Plan" would be more than enough in terms of value delivered.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it's not about what the product is, it's about what it stands next to. You can use this fact to steer the decision making process in the direction of your liking. Make it easy for your users to compare and contrast different offerings. Even if you don't plan to sell a cheaper option, offer it anyway and put it next to the one which is slightly more expensive but more feature rich. You'd be amazed to see that most of your users will go with the more expensive option even if they'll never user all the features it offers.</p>
<h3>5. Fear</h3>
<p>A huge major driving force which is ingrained in everyone of us is fear. Fear comes in many different forms. We're fearful of failure, bad things happening to our loved ones and the inevitable death.</p>
<p>Another form of fear is the "fear of missing out" a.k.a FOMO. Always being in the known gives us huge advantages and an edge over our competition. Missing out on a major new trend or business opportunity could have detrimental consequences.</p>
<p>You can trigger the "fear of missing out" by subtly talking about the possibility of missing out on a huge opportunity when passing on your offering.</p>
<p>A prime example which shows this in action are travel booking websites. Remember that "12 people have visited this listing in the last 6 hours" notification on the hotel website. You don't want to be the person who misses out on this great deal!</p>
<h3>6. Social Proof</h3>
<p>As we already learned, us humans are social animals. Being social doesn't only mean that we like to socialize with each other, it also means that we tend to mimic and "copy" one another to be more likeable and therefore accepted in our peer group.</p>
<p>Do you want to buy something but you're not sure which option to go with? It might be a good idea to study the testimonials, reviews and ratings to make a more informed decision. The new Todo-app you just discovered looks quite compelling but why bother given that you're already using the stock Todo-app on your phone? As it turns out, at least a handful of Fortune 500 companies and Silicon Valley juggernauts are using it in their day-to-day so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>You want to be a part of your tribe so naturally you're looking at what your peers are doing. This is what "Social Proof" is all about. Showing that you're about to make the right decision because peers in your tribe did the same.</p>
<p>Do you already have happy customers using your app? Take some time to conduct some interviews and translate those into testimonials you can put on your Landing Page. Maybe you have some large enterprises using your product. Write some Case Studies to show what value your product offers. There are entire software applications you can use to display social proof widgets on your homepage or ecommerce store ("Someone in New York bought this item 2 hours ago").</p>
<h3>7. Acting logical</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to believe that all the decisions she makes are entirely driven by logic. As it turns out this is not true most of the time. You and I buy products based on emotion rather than logic. Just pay close attention to the advertisements you see every day. Almost every single one speaks in the language of emotions rather than logic.</p>
<p>But once the decision has been made and the purchase is done we tend to justify our actions based on logic. "I bought the car because there was a discount and a friend of mine knows the car dealership owner. Furthermore I get the first service for free and it's also an older model so it's cheaper than buying a brand new one. ...". Observe yourself and others and you'll notice that all of us try to retroactively fit our decision making into logical bits and pieces. Even if it sometime results in contradictions and lies.</p>
<p>What you want to do is to supply additional information about your product which helps your users justify the purchase in a logical manner. Have a dedicated "Features" page which lists out all the …</p></div></div></div>

December 30, 2020 | https://drobinin.com/posts/things-i-learnt-in-2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://drobinin.com/posts/things-i-learnt-in-2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am pretty much a knowledge addict.</p>
<p>I use Twitter, RSS, and numerous other mediums of information — from Telegram channels to standalone blogs.</p>
<p>Out of a thousand articles a hundred gets skimmed through. A few dozens make it to my "Read Later" list, and only a fraction I find worthy of sharing.</p>
<p>These worthy ones end up in <a href="https://drobinin.com/newsletter/">my weekly newsletter, the Tuesday Triage</a>, where I comment on the most intriguing articles I've read and share facts I learnt over the week.</p>
<p>Some of those trivia are not trivial at all, so I decided to condense this <em>crème de la crème of the Internet</em> in a subjective list of the best ones in no particular order.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="solresol"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solresol">Solresol</a> <a href="#solresol">¶</a></h4>
<p>Most people know about the esperanto, an artificially created language. Way less people are aware of Solresol, another artificial language, built upon the musical grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your health good? - Redofafa?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the countryside this year? - Fadoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Will you go to the theatre tonight? - Soldoremi?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Sol-resol.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="logbook"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Logbook</a> <a href="#logbook">¶</a></h4>
<p>As developers we work with logs a lot. And the logs are stored in logbooks (or at least they were). What's the ethymology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term originally referred to a book for recording readings from the chip log that was used to estimate a ship's speed through the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how come a chip log was used to estimate a ship's speed? In the absence of GPS and without any visible clues about the speed of a ship in the open water, sailors started to throw wooden pieces with a tied strope (hence the definition of knots as nautical miles per hour!) into water and then measure the relative speed against such logs, hence the name.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="popcorn-in-the-1800s"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn#Consumption">Popcorn in the 1800s</a> <a href="#popcorn-in-the-1800s">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Popcorn as a breakfast cereal was consumed by Americans in the 1800s and generally consisted of popcorn with milk and a sweetener.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't surprise me when I think about this as a dish, and yet I'd probably never come up with that on my own.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="danakil-depression"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danakil_Depression">Danakil Depression</a> <a href="#danakil-depression">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Danakil Depression is the northern part of the Afar Triangle or Afar Depression in Ethiopia, a geological depression that has resulted from the divergence of three tectonic plates in the Horn of Africa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3682/10387154385_32f2fdb136_b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ansi-k-100.1-1974"><a href="https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6140/K100.1-1974%20-%20American%20National%20Standard%20Safety%20Code%20%26%20Requirements%20for%20Dry%20Martinis%20.pdf">ANSI K 100.1-1974</a> <a href="#ansi-k-100.1-1974">¶</a></h4>
<p>The year is 1974. The American National Standards Institute introduces safety code and requirements for dry martinis, and boy-oh-boy are they good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p><em>Gibson.</em><br>
An unpardonable form of perversion. See onion soup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test Methods</p>
<p>[...] In testing, the taster shall watch for lightness of color, absence of sediment, a delicate aroma that effectively combines the scent of the juniper with the herbal infusion in the vermouth, a taste that is both sharp and clean with a faint body, and a light delicate aftertaste.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4 id="by-the-bye"><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/57078/by-the-bye-etymology-and-usage">By the bye</a> <a href="#by-the-bye">¶</a></h4>
<p>This example left me, to put it succinctly, flabbergasted for a brief moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>by the by or by the bye : INCIDENTALLY [defined as "by way of interjection or digression : by the way"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if it will help me to up the game of interrupting folks in conversations.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="pie-barm"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barm_cake">Pie Barm</a> <a href="#pie-barm">¶</a></h4>
<p>Watch after my hands:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We ferment a liquid (beer, wine, or stock)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We take the foam from the top of the liquid (this is called <strong>barm</strong>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use this foam to leaven a bread roll, and then put something inside it (now this is called a <strong>barm cake</strong>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we do all of that in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England, we most likely would put a pie as a filling (they also host the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-46620294/world-pie-eating-champion-crowned-in-wigan">World Pie Eating Championship</a>, so no surprise). And here it is, the pie barm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Wigan, a whole savoury pie is served in a barm cake, known locally as a "Wigan Kebab".</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/random-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5813a857-4338-41ec-a2db-d751d986268c.jpeg?resize=878%2C659&amp;ssl=1" alt="The image by https://random-times.com/2020/04/24/pie-barm-an-unconventional-traditional-sandwich-from-wigan-england/"></p><hr>
<h4 id="two-spaces-after-period"><a href="https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/two-spaces-after-period/">Two spaces after period</a> <a href="#two-spaces-after-period">¶</a></h4>
<p>Back then people had to put two spaces after punctuation marks as typewriters had monospaced typesetting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s why: Back when we used typewriters, every character was given the exact same amount of space on the page. That meant the letter i was given the same amount of space as the letter m, even though it clearly didn’t need it. This is called monospaced typesetting and it’s, well, spacey. We needed that extra space between sentences to make it easier to see the beginning of new sentences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days quite a few still do that; usually one can easily assume they've learnt to type not on a computer.</p>
<p>Rarely, one encounters someone like me, with a typewriter next to the keyboard, and just thinks I am stupid and don't know thine grammar.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="erstwhile"><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erstwhile">erstwhile</a> <a href="#erstwhile">¶</a></h4>
<p>Here is a beautiful word I unearthed recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverb erstwhile has been part of English since the 16th century, but it is formed from two words that are much older. It comes from the Old English words ær, meaning "early", and hwīl, which has much the same meaning as the modern word while. (The English word ere, meaning "before," is also descendant of ær.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Used as a synonim to "former", e.g "erstwhile enemies".</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail"><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/brief-history-children-sent-through-mail-180959372/">Children used to be sent through the Mail</a> <a href="#children-used-to-be-sent-through-the-mail">¶</a></h4>
<p>I am just surprised that this practice was eventually banned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a few weeks after Parcel Post began, an Ohio couple named Jesse and Mathilda Beagle “mailed” their 8-month-old son James to his grandmother, who lived just a few miles away in Batavia. According to Lynch, Baby James was just shy of the 11-pound weight limit for packages sent via Parcel Post, and his “delivery” cost his parents only 15 cents in postage (although they did insure him for $50).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postage was cheaper than train tickets back then (and still is, actually), so I can't really blame the parents.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ek-number"><a href="https://digg.com/2018/how-different-countries-laugh-online">ek number</a> <a href="#ek-number">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes I realize that speaking in one (two, three, ...) languages means there are corners of the Internet and/or world you can't appreciate, in the first place because you can't understand them.</p>
<p>So while knowing both English and Russian is usually more than enough to find an answer to almost any question, I still miss the jewels like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ek number," which loosely translates to "I rate this number one" — the "ek" itself means "one" in Hindi — is commonly used as an affirmative response to a joke. If you find something to be funny, you could always type "haha" or "hehe" in India, but you can also signal your enjoyment by responding "ek number."</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h4 id="remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips"><a href="http://www.dandelionchocolate.com/2020/06/18/remy-chocolate-chip/">Remy Labesque and chocolate chips</a> <a href="#remy-labesque-and-chocolate-chips">¶</a></h4>
<p>Chocolate chips have a water drop's shape because it's easier to make that way. It's harder to use though.</p>
<p>Remy Labesque, one of Tesla's designers, helped Dandelion Chocolate to invent a machine to make ideal chocolate chips:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shape of a typical store-bought chocolate chip is an arbitrary result of the industrial manufacturing process used to make it. As you might expect, a drop of molten chocolate is deposited onto a flat surface and left to cool. Chocolate chip taste varies widely by brand, but the shape of the chips does not.</p>
<p>The shape of our chip is faceted: The edges of a Dandelion Chocolate chip taper to thin-as-we could-make-’em without compromising structure. This is because the thermal mass of a thin piece of chocolate melts more quickly on the palate. So when you put a Dandelion chip on your tongue, the thin, chiseled edges warm-to-melt nearly instantly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1 lb of these chips costs 30$, not bad.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="ogden's-basic-english"><a href="http://ogden.basic-english.org/">Ogden's Basic English</a> <a href="#ogden's-basic-english">¶</a></h4>
<p>Apparently removing all redundancies, synonims, etc from the English language leaves us only with 850 words or so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call this simplified language Basic English, the developer is Charles K. Ogden, and was released in 1930 with the book: Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar. He founded the Orthological Institute to develop the tools for teaching Basic English. His most famous associate, I.A. Richards, led the effort in the Orient, which uses the techniques to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most interesting bit is, that change doesn't affect the grammar, so one could learn only 850 words and yet converse in English by using its grammar to its full extent.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="brick-pencil"><a href="http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/brick-pencil/">Brick pencil</a> <a href="#brick-pencil">¶</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Engelbart</a>, one of the people behind the creation of a computer mouse, and then graphical interfaces, argued about interfaces in his paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: a Conceptual Framework" in 1962 and to proof his point came up with a brick pencil:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brains of power equal to ours could have evolved in an environment where the combination of artifact materials and muscle strengths were so scaled that the neatest scribing tool (equivalent to a pencil, possible had a shape and mass as manageable as a brick would be to us-assuming that our muscles were not specially conditioned to deal with it. We fastened a pencil to a brick and experimented. Figure 2 shows the results, compared with typewriting and ordinary pencil writing. With the brick pencil, we are slower and less precise. If we want to hurry the writing, we have to make it larger. Also, writing the passage twice with the brick-pencil tires the untrained hand and arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/images/augment-3906/fig2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>(and now users complain that they have to click a button twice; such a shame)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="cosmic-latte"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte">Cosmic Latte</a> <a href="#cosmic-latte">¶</a></h4>
<p>Wikipedia sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cosmic latte is the average colour of the universe, found by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those keen on putting this into their apps, here is the colour: #FFF8E7.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="7-up's-history"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Up#History">7-UP's history</a> <a href="#7-up's-history">¶</a></h4>
<p>In my childhood I used to love 7-UP a lot, mostly because it was nearly transparent hence felt less poisonous comparing to other sodas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It contained lithium citrate, a mood-stabilizing drug, until 1948</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably if I were to drink it until 1948 it'd be my favourite drink anyway, but not because of its (lack of) colour.</p>
<p>Also all myths about its name are hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A myth exists that the 7 Up name comes from the drink having a pH over 7. That would make it neutral or basic on the scale; however, this is not the case, as the 7 Up pH is close to 3.79, making it acidic on the pH scale and similar to other drinks of this type. [...]<br>
The real origin of the name is unclear, though Britvic claims that the name comes from the seven main ingredients in the drink, while others have claimed that the number was a coded reference to the lithium contained in the original recipe, which has an atomic mass around 7.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this one makes the most sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Britvic also claims that the name is a result of the fact that 7 Up was bottled in 7-ounce bottles …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> has given rise to a new generation of chess enthusiasts. <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/"><em>How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</em></a>’s traffic quadrupled between October and November 2020, and Lichess traffic <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">jumped 10%</a> in that same span. To all the new and reengaged chess players, welcome!</p>
<p>As part of this surge of interest, many new players have sent me questions and comments on openings. What opening do I choose? Is the reason I lose because I don’t want to memorize as many openings as my opponents? What do you think about [insert opening here]?</p>
<p>Here’s my thesis:</p>
<p><em>The best opening for rapid chess improvement is the one that gets you to a comfortable middlegame position with as little work as possible<sup>1</sup></em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article lays out specific, concrete openings that I’ve selected for you. They require minimal study, work against a variety of responses from your opponent, and naturally flow to comfortable middlegame positions. These are well-established, sound openings that my students have seen success with, and there are multiple openings you can choose from to suit your own chess preferences and tastes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only prerequisite is that you understand the basic opening principles of developing your pieces, controlling the center, getting your king safe (usually via castling), and connecting the rooks. <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/opening-principles">Chess.com’s interactive primer</a> looks good if you’re not familiar with them or need a refresher. It’s also helpful to be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic chess notation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this post is designed to help you improve without a coach, I’m taking on a few students to coach within this structure to help accelerate their improvement. If that’s something you’re interested in, feel free to reach out to me at <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9ded8cccdd8d4f9ded8cccdd8d4d7d8cbccd5d897dad6d4">gautam[at]gautamnarula.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Openings for White</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, I quickly recommended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_System">The London System</a> and moved on without elaborating much further. I’m going to go a little more in-depth about the London here, as well as offer other options (including a 1.e4 option!) for players who don’t enjoy the types of positions that emerge from the London.</p>
<p><strong><u>Opening for 1. d4 players: The London System or the Colle-Zukertort</u></strong></p>
<p>The London System features the moves 1. d4, 2. Nf3, 3. Bf4, 4. e3, followed by c3, Bd3, Nbd2 and O-O in the appropriate order depending on the opponent’s moves (Diagram 1). It has been <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1813667">deployed</a> by none other than World Champion Magnus Carlsen! It’s so difficult for Black to stop you from achieving this basic setup that it’s not necessary to write out sample lines like I do for the e4 opening below.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 1: </strong>The ideal London System setup.</p>
<p>A cousin of the London system is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_System">Colle</a>, where the pawn is pushed to e3 before the c1 bishop has moved, blocking it in. The <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1025949">Colle-Zukertort</a> is an improvement on the Colle where that bishop is fianchettoed on the queenside, and can lead to some more interesting positions than the London in my experience (Diagram 2).</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 2: </strong>The ideal Colle-Zukertort setup. Notice that compared to the London System, the f4 bishop is now on b2 and the c3 pawn push has been replaced with the b3 pawn push.</p>
<p>One example Colle-Zukertort line:</p>

<p>Some ideas for White here: placing a rook on c1 and pushing for central expansion with c2-c4, or placing a knight on e5 followed by a f2-f4 push and a potential kingside attack.</p>
<p><b><u>Opening for 1. e4 players: The King’s Indian Attack</u></b></p>
<p>1. e4 openings are inherently more difficult to play than d4 openings<sup>3</sup>, so we’ll have to spend a little more time learning my pick, the King’s Indian Attack (KIA). The KIA has a storied history, with <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1008365">many stunning victories coming from a young Bobby Fischer</a> in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. It’s basically the King’s Indian Defense (which is, more or less, my recommendation as Black) with colors reversed, and the extra tempo from playing as White gives you the flexibility to play it against just about anything.</p>
<p>The KIA setup involves the moves e4, d3, Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0, typically resulting in the structure in Diagram 3.<span><!-- [if gte vml 1]><v:shape

<p><b>Diagram 3:</b> Standard KIA setup.</p>
<p>White’s king is castled and safe, and White exerts control of the center with the two pawns and knights. White’s main plan is a well-timed e4-e5 pawn push, accompanied with gaining space and potentially aiming for a kingside attack (those acquainted with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence#Closed_Sicilian">Closed Sicilian</a> will find these kinds of positions familiar). The main challenge is to figure out how to develop the c1 bishop efficiently.</p>
<p>Below are a few sample lines of what you might face:</p>
<p><b>1…e5 (King’s Pawn Game)</b></p>

<p><b>1…c5 <strong>(Sicilian Defense)</strong></b></p>

<p><strong>1…e6 (French Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…c6 (Caro-Kann Defense)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1…d5 (Scandinavian Defense)</strong></p>
<p>The Scandinavian used to be a great surprise opening and rare enough that in years past I wouldn’t have included it here, but thanks to the valiant efforts of IM John Bartholomew and #teamscandi it’s become pretty popular at the amateur level (and I’ve been recommending a Scandi variant to my students for over a decade as well, so naturally my massive influence has popularized it and shifted the frontiers of chess at both the amateur and professional levels). Unfortunately, you can’t go into a standard KIA structure (1. e4 d5 2. d3 dxe4 3.dxe4 Qxe1+ 4. Kxe1 and clearly this is a very different kind of game).</p>
<p>So instead, my suggestion is to exchange the pawns and bring the knight to c3 followed by the KIA style fianchetto.</p>
<p> You can do the same against 3…Qd6, which I recommend for Black below. White has a flexible and comfortable position and aim to exert more central control with Rf1-e1 and potentially maneuvering one of the knights to e4.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Opening for 1. c4 Players: Read a Book</strong></span></p>
<p>I said it in How to Get Good at Chess, Fast and I’ll say it again: you’re on your own. Being a hipster has its costs. Truth hurts! I’ve heard good things about <a href="https://amzn.to/38xREcp">Starting Out: The English</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Openings for Black</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gautamnarula.com/how-to-get-good-at-chess-fast/">How to Get Good at Chess, Fast</a>, for Black I recommended a kingside fianchetto setup involving the moves Nf6, g6, d6, Bg7, and O-O (Diagram 4). I’ll elaborate on that here. I also offer an alternative option, the Qd6 Scandinavian + …g6 Slav, for those who prefer to contest for central control right away rather than let White immediately build up a center.</p>

<p><strong>Diagram 4: </strong>The basic kingside fianchetto structure.</p>
<p>The idea behind this structure is its flexibility. You can strike in the center with …e5 and …Nc6, potentially following up with a kingside attack. You can play more on the queenside with …Nbd7 and …c5, potentially transposing to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence">Sicilian</a> line.</p>
<p>Experienced players might point out that this could lead to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defense">King’s Indian Defense</a> (KID) or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirc_defense">Pirc Defense</a>, which turn out to be rather complicated openings. This is true, but you can play both these openings with little theoretical knowledge up to the 1600 level and still be fine. The main idea you need to be aware of is avoiding getting overrun in the center with a well timed …e5 or …c5 push if white is building up a central pawn phalanx. Here are a few sample lines which show this idea.</p>
<p>The King’s Indian Defense:</p>
 <p><span>Notice Black plays 4…d6 rather than castling first, makes it more uncomfortable for white to kick the knight around with 5. e5 (5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ 7. Nxd1 Ne4 is much more comfortable for Black). Black also plays 6…e5 to strike back at the center. If White plays 7.d5, Black has the logical move 7… Nbd7 with the goal of trying to secure the c5 square for the knight.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the main line of the KID, and I included it here so you can see the ideas in action – White has the option of building up a strong center against the fianchetto system<sup>2</sup> and Black <em>must</em> counterstrike in the center to avoid an uncomfortable and inferior position. On the flipside, White has to watch out for the fianchettoed g7 bishop – many games are decided by tactics against a rook on a1 or a knight on c3. </span></p>
<p>For e4, we have the Pirc Defense:</p>
<p> Similar ideas here: strike back at the center ..c5 or …e5 at the appropriate moment. A related idea is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_(chess)">Hedgehog structure</a>, which is also surprisingly resilient.</p>
<p>You may also want to review opposite side castling attacks, which could happen if White decides to castle queenside instead. These games are a lot of fun but can get a bit crazy!</p>
<p><strong><u>The g6 Slav + Qd6 Scandinavian</u></strong></p>
<p>Some of my student’s have seen great results with kingside fianchetto structures, but I’ll admit these structures can result in games that are a bit intense. This is a quieter alternative that’s still easy to learn and leads to interesting positions.</p>
<p>Against d4, my recommendation is the g6 Slav (my engine tells me this is called the Schlechter Variation), which almost always will go 1…d5 2…c6 3….Nf7 4…g6, typically with …Bg7 and …O-O to follow <strong>(Diagram 5)</strong></p>

<p>One typical variation could go:</p>

<p>Another is to exchange the pawns on d5:</p>

<p>A variant of this plan is for White is to pressure d5 with Qb3 and Bg5 to force Black to play e6 and lock in the c8 bishop:</p>

<p>Black gets a flexible position and, by not committing a pawn to e6 early like in other similar openings (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense">Semi-Slav</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence">French</a>), leaves the possibility open in non-Qb3 variations for developing the c8 bishop to a good square and only then playing e6 to support the d5 focal point in the center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against e4, my recommendation is the Qd6 Scandinavian, which begins with 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 (Diagram 6).</p>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><h3 id="discoverability">Discoverability</h3><p>Newsletter directories sole purpose is to help people find the best newsletters to read in any category they're interested in. Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter. The more eyes your newsletter is in front of the more you'll grow.</p><h3 id="passive-growth">Passive Growth</h3><p>One of the most interesting benefits of submitting your newsletter to a directory is the passive growth you'll receive. Do the work of submitting your newsletter once, get passive subscribe growth forever. Every weekly you'll slowly grow from this channel without needing to think twice.</p><p>Nick Frost from <a href="https://www.newsletters.co/">Newsletters.co</a> and <a href="https://inboxstash.com/">InboxStash</a> says to expect about 10-20 new subscribers the first week you submit to a newsletter directory. Also a newsletter directories authority grows, growth picks up for all newsletters.

            <p>All about Newsletter Directories with Nick Frost</p>
            <p>About this episode: This week we have Nick Frost, the expert on newsletter directories. Nick runs two of the most popular newsletter directories, newsletters.co and inboxstash.com. We've been hearing a lot of questions about what newsletter directories are, what they're used for, why you should submit to them, and what benefits they provide. So we wanted to bring Nick on and have him answer them all.

<p>Wasmino is an Arduino core fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. It allows you to compile your Arduino sketch to WebAssembly and run it in a browser, all using the Arduino IDE.</p>



<h2>Showcase</h2>



<p>This is the off-the-shelf “Fade” example in the Arduino IDE.</p>


<pre title="">/*
  Fade

  This example shows how to fade an LED on pin 9 using the analogWrite()
  function.

  The analogWrite() function uses PWM, so if you want to change the pin you're
  using, be sure to use another PWM capable pin. On most Arduino, the PWM pins
  are identified with a "~" sign, like ~3, ~5, ~6, ~9, ~10 and ~11.

  This example code is in the public domain.

  http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade
*/

int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // declare pin 9 to be an output:
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // set the brightness of pin 9:
  analogWrite(led, brightness);

  // change the brightness for next time through the loop:
  brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;

  // reverse the direction of the fading at the ends of the fade:
  if (brightness &lt;= 0 || brightness &gt;= 255) {
    fadeAmount = -fadeAmount;
  }
  // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
  delay(30);
}
</pre>


<p>You can see it compiled to WASM and running here:</p>



<p>(<strong>Click the “Run” button</strong> and the LED should start to animate)</p>



<p><a href="https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D">https://demo.wasmino.org/#src=gist%3A%2F%2F01734051e7ab5b82173ea947b882ad80&amp;pins=%7B%229%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22led%22%7D%7D</a></p>



<h2>Setting it up</h2>



<p>Disclaimer: The toolchain is only tested on Windows (x86-64) and Linux (x86-64), and probably will work for MacOS. It 100% won’t work on 32bit systems since some dependencies (WASI and Binaryen) are 64bit only.</p>



<p>You’ll need your Arduino IDE installed first.</p>



<p>Go to File -&gt; Preferences, and add <a href="https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json">https://github.com/wasmino/wasmino-core/releases/download/v0.0.1/package_wasmino_index.json</a> to “Additional Boards Manager URLs”.</p>

<p>Install “Wasmino Virtual Boards” in Tools -&gt; Board -&gt; Board Manager. Select Wasmino as as target board.</p>



<p>Write some Arduino code, click upload, and an URL will be generated for you. (If you are uploading for the first time, it will ask you to login to your GitHub account. It uses GitHub Gist for saving the compiled WASM binary. The login times out in 60 seconds.)</p>

<p>Paste that URL into your browser and use the UI to add LEDs or toggle switches. The URL will automatically update as you make changes. You can then copy the resulting URL in the browser and share it with other people.</p>



<h2>Caveats</h2>



<p>The Wasmino should be viewed as having an infinitely fast CPU, and operations other than <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code> do not take any CPU time. Calling time functions <code>micros</code> and <code>millis</code> should reflect this. IO can only happen during sleep, therefore you cannot do</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {} // this will hang the browser tab
</pre>


<p>and should do this instead</p>


<pre title="">while (!digitalRead(2)) {
    delay(50);
}
</pre>


<p>Having a infinitely fast CPU also means that interrupts will only happen during <code>delay</code> and <code>delayMicroseconds</code>. It is still good practice to use <code>noInterrupts</code> and <code>interrupts</code> to protect critical sections if you plan to use your code on real hardware.</p>



<p>Other caveats exist such as the lack of <code>BUILTIN_LED</code> macro since Wasmino, being virtual, doesn’t have a built-in LED.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Neurocognitive studies by researchers at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU) show that headlines with emotional content influence our judgments about other people even when we consider the media source to be untrustworthy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Rumours, half-truths and misinformation can be consumed and shared non-stop online and have an enormous reach. Although their truthfulness is questionable, they can have a significant impact on personal opinions and public discourse. Until now, however, little was known about the consequences of confrontation with such information on how it is processed in our brains and to what extent this neural process influences our judgments. New findings from neurocognitive psychology show that emotionally charged headlines exert a major influence on the way we process information and form judgments of others, even when we do not consider the news source credible.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Exposure to headlines from trustworthy and untrustworthy sources</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The credibility we ascribe to news sources seems to be a simple cue for judging or classifying the truthfulness of information. But does such classification also protect us from the influence of emotional headlines? To investigate this, subjects in the study by the Berlin School of Mind and Brain and the HU’s Department of Psychology were confronted with fictitious headlines in the particular online layouts of well-known German media sources. There, they read headlines with social-emotional or comparatively neutral information about fictitious persons. For example, one person was reported to have embezzled tax revenues and another, to have shown outstanding civil courage. After a short break, the brain activity of the subjects was measured while they judged the persons presented on the basis of their faces. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Emotions influence our judgments – the credibility of the media source has no effect</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Although the participants rated the media sources as having different levels of credibility, these ratings did not play a role in the formation of their opinions. The emotional content of the headlines, on the other hand, had a strong impact on their judgments: even when subjects did not trust a news source, they made extreme judgments about people whose negative or positive behaviour was reported in the headlines. Participants rated people whose behaviour was described as negative as unlikable and negative, while they rated people who made headlines due to good deeds as very likable and positive.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span>Brain activity shows the impact of emotional headlines</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The subjects' brain activity was recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG) while they made judgments about the individuals. Fast, involuntary brain responses can be distinguished here from slower, more controlled responses. The researchers had expected the latter to involve consideration of the source's credibility in addition to emotion, and thus that credibility might factor into people’s judgments, whereas emotion should dominate in early and more involuntary responses. However, both late and early brain responses showed dominant influences of headline emotionality independent of credibility. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">These new findings show that news content that triggers emotions such as excitement or outrage does not simply bounce off us, even when the trustworthiness of the source is judged to be low. Rather, reservations about the reliability of a source have no effect when emotional content dominates our judgment. Recognising and further exploring these consequences of emotionally charged news is an essential first step in protecting against the potentially damaging ramifications of rumours, half-truths, and misinformation. </span></span></span></span></p>

December 30, 2020 | https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/trading_evolved_1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/trading_evolved_1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <h2 id="rational"><a href="#rational"></a> Rational</h2>
<p>In my last blog-post <a href="https://weisser-zwerg.dev/posts/investing-abstract-view">Investing: Abstract View</a> I described a high level view on trading and the possibilities you have
available for implementing your trading strategies.</p>
<p>Since I’ve read Andreas F. Clenow’s books:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andreas-F-Clenow/dp/1118410858">Following the Trend: Diversified Managed Futures Trading</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Andreas-F-Clenow/dp/109198378X">Trading Evolved</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am sold on the idea that the only “proper” way to implement trading strategies is to use financial
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract">futures</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Futures provide you with a single interface to a wide variety of financial assets: stocks/equities, commodities (agricultural and non-agricultural),
interest rates (bonds) and currencies.</li>
<li>Futures naturally exist as long and short. Whenever you buy a future contract somebody else sells that contract or vice versa, so they always exist
as pairs. This means that you can easily go short on any asset for which a future exists. In stock trading this is not the case. Even, if in
principle you are able to <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/0071759344">short-sell</a> stocks, in practice exactly at the time when you’d like to
short-sell you cannot, because nobody lends you the stocks you want to short-sell or even worse you have to get out of your short position, because
the lender of your stock wants his stock back and he can demand that on a daily basis. Short selling is essential for some strategies like
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/quantopian/research_public/blob/master/notebooks/lectures/Introduction_to_Pairs_Trading/notebook.ipynb">pairs-trading</a>
and you do not want to be restricted in your implementation of your ideas by technical shortcomings.</li>
<li>When you stay with stocks/equities the level of diversification is severely hampered. In finance this is called <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/correlation-tightening/15102122">correlation
tightening</a>: “In falling markets, the only thing that rises is correlation.”
When you talk to banks and they propose an investment strategy to you they talk about how a well diversified portfolio can protect you from the worst
downturns. At the same time they neglect to mention that in principle they’re right, but in practice you cannot achieve diversification as long as
you stay with stocks/equities. As soon as you switch over to the universe of exchange traded futures you have a much wider variety of products to
trade and you actually <strong>CAN</strong> achieve diversification.</li>
<li>Trading futures is cheaper from a transaction cost perspective. Futures typically exist in large quantities, but trading one such large quantity
costs 2€ or less.</li>
<li>When trading futures you only need a fraction of the capital you would need if you invested in stocks/equities. You only have to provide the initial
margin, which is typically a small fraction of the nominal position value.</li>
<li>… read Andreas’ books to discover more reasons …</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are also a couple of downsides to using financial futures like the fact that you have to regularly roll your positions or how they are
treated from a tax perspective in your jurisdiction, but I consider those issues to be purely technical issues that can be overcome. All in all I do
not understand why neither advisors at banks nor financial journalists advertise the advantages of futures trading much more. Everybody always only
talks about stocks and never about the extended universe you can access via futures. In case you don’t plan to trade futures yourself you could make
use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertakings_for_Collective_Investment_in_Transferable_Securities_Directive_2009">UCITS</a> funds like (just as an
example) the <a href="https://www.almacapital.com/funds/quantica-managed-futures/">Alma (Platinum) Quantica Managed Futures</a> fund (or any other UCITS futures
fund) to participate in the extended universe that futures offer.</p>
<p>I did not want to take Andreas’ word for granted on how great futures are and so I implemented the trading strategies he desribed in “Trading Evolved”
myself. Below you can find the step by step instructions to follow to create the required set-up. In a next blog post I’ll then report about the
results of replicating Andreas’ futures trading strategies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: I will mention some commercial offerings just to make it easier for you to get started. I am not profiting in any way from doing so.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="why%3F"><a href="#why%3F"></a> Why?</h3>
<p>You might ask yourself why the following is relevant? Even after reading Andreas’ books, which are very well written, it was still quite some effort
to assemble and compile all the relevant information to get started with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtesting</a>. It seems
that the naming of future contracts is not as standardized as the naming of stocks (using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Securities_Identification_Number">ISIN</a>). It took me quite some time to find the contracts that Andreas
mentioned in his books and cross check their characteristics (like the <code>Full Point Value</code> and the corresponding <code>multiplier</code> and <code>minor_fx_adj</code> values
in zipline).</p>
<p>Some information sources that helped me in the context of CSI Data were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSI Data <a href="http://www.csidata.com/factsheets.php?type=commodity&amp;format=htmltable&amp;exchangeid=">Factsheet</a> gives you a comprehensive overview of all
(futures) data that CSI provides.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.csidata.com/?page_id=3271">Point and Tick Values</a> definitions as given by CSI Data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environments%3A-linux-and-windows"><a href="#environments%3A-linux-and-windows"></a> Environments: Linux and Windows</h3>
<p>I implemented the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backtesting.asp">backtesting</a> via <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">zipline</a> on
Linux. In principle all of the backtesting environment is independent of the operating system, but in practice I used symbolic links in several places
of my implementation, which Windows does not support (MacOSX is fine). You would have to modify the code in those places to make the code run on
Windows, too.</p>
<p>To download the futures data from CSI you need a Windows machine or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VM</a> available, because CSI only allows the download
of data via its rich-client <code>Unfair Advantage</code> software (see below).</p>
<h2 id="quantopian%3A-zipline"><a href="#quantopian%3A-zipline"></a> Quantopian: Zipline</h2>
<p>Andreas uses <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline">Quantopian: Zipline</a> as his back testing environment for the python programming language. In
addition he suggests to use futures data from <a href="http://www.csidata.com/">CSI</a>. CSI describes itself as: “a low cost information vendor of summary world
financial market data.” In order to make the data from CSI available to zipline you have to write a zipline <code>bundle</code>. Below I’ll describe the whole
set-up process.</p>
<h3 id="anaconda"><a href="#anaconda"></a> Anaconda</h3>
<p>As a first step, please install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads">Anaconda</a>. Anaconda is a package manager for python and
data-science packages.</p>
<h3 id="andreas_clenow_trading_evolved"><a href="#andreas_clenow_trading_evolved"></a> andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</h3>
<p>Next clone the <a href="https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved">andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</a> github project:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved.git
&gt; cd andreas_clenow_trading_evolved
</code></pre>
<p>and use the scripts in <code>0000-py36zl-conda-env</code> to create the <code>py36zl</code> python/anaconda environment:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd 0000-py36zl-conda-env
&gt; ./env-create.sh
</code></pre>
<p>You can switch into this environment via:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; conda activate py36zl
</code></pre>
<p>Andreas describes in his book the steps you have to manually perform to fix a couple of minor issues in zipline for making it ready to handle futures
data. To spare you the trouble I’ve forked zipline from the quantopian original and have applied the changes. You can see the differences here:
<a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/compare/master...cs224:20201009-modifications">cs224:20201009-modifications</a></p>
<p>In order to install this version of zipline make sure you’ve activated the <code>py36zl</code> environment as described above and then execute:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/cs224/zipline.git
&gt; cd zipline
&gt; git checkout 20201009-modifications
&gt; pip install -e .
</code></pre>
<h3 id="csi-data"><a href="#csi-data"></a> CSI Data</h3>
<p>Before going into details on how to ingest data for use in zipline you have to have some data. I personally bought the <a href="https://csidata2.com/cgi-bin/ua_order_form_nw.pl">History
Only</a> package (click on the “History Only” “Subscription Type”) for “World Futures” for 20
years. This is 350 USD, which is not bad.</p>
<p>Once you have the data you have to download and instlal the <a href="http://www.csidata.com/?page_id=55">Unfair Advantage</a> software package. I
suggest that you use one of the “(Software + Database)” packages. Once you have installed <code>Unfair Advantage</code> you have to download the data you want
via this application and you have to do that within 30 days. The <code>Unfair Advantage</code> software is an old Windows native application and it is damn slow!
For only 100 base symbols expect to wait something like 3 to 6 hours. For the full futures database expect 48 to 72 hours. Actually the download speed
degrades over time. It might be useful to split the symbols you want into chuncks and then download chuck by chunck. I’ve written to the CSI support
to report my issues and they mentioned that they’re working on a new version of this software. Hopefully they release this new version soon.</p>
<p>Actually the <code>Unfair Advantage</code> UI is overwhelming. I only used the feature to define a portfolio by providing a space separated list of base symbols
that you can find via the CSI Data <a href="http://www.csidata.com/factsheets.php?type=commodity&amp;format=htmltable&amp;exchangeid=">Factsheet</a> and then exported
the portfolio as a CSV. I initally tried to export as an excel file, but ran into trouble, e.g. go for the CSV/ASCII export!</p>
<p>The default data-format is <code>DNOHLCviVI</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>D = Date</li>
<li>N = Delivery Number</li>
<li>O = Open</li>
<li>H = High</li>
<li>L = Low</li>
<li>C = Close</li>
<li>v = contract volume</li>
<li>i = contract open interest</li>
<li>V = total volume</li>
<li>I = total open interest</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use the <code>csi_futures_data</code> bundle that I’ll introduce below you need to keep that format.</p>
<p>As a start I suggest you open the file <code>futures_markets_lookup.xlsx</code> and copy the symbols from the <code>csi_symbol</code> column and make a portfolio of those
symbols in the <code>Unfair Advantage</code> application. You can then download the data for those symbols. This should generate a file system hierarchy as follows:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── AC
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_0000$_Spot.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005M.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005N.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005Q.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005U.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AC_2005V.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ...
...
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── AD_2025M.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── AD_2025U.CSV
├── BO2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── BO20000$.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── BO22000V.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── BO22000Z.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── BO22001F.CSV

...
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── YI_2024N.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── YI_2024Z.CSV
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── YI_2025N.CSV
└── YM
    ├── YM_0000$.CSV
    ├── YM_2000Z.CSV
    ├── YM_2001H.CSV
...
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have that file hierarchy you can use the <code>csi_futures_data</code> bundle to ingest that data.</p>
<h3 id="csi_futures_data-bundle"><a href="#csi_futures_data-bundle"></a> csi_futures_data bundle</h3>
<p>Above you already cloned the <a href="https://github.com/cs224/andreas_clenow_trading_evolved">andreas_clenow_trading_evolved</a> github project. In that project
you’ll also find a <code>csi_futures_data</code> sub-folder. In there is a symbolic link that will point to <code>PATH_TO_YOUR_CSI_DATA_DIRECTORY</code>. As the name
suggests you have to set this link to point to the real CSI data directory.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd csi_futures_data
&gt; rm data
&gt; ln -s PATH_TO_YOUR_REAL_CSI_DATA_DIRECTORY data
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you’ve activated the zipline anaconda environment.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; conda activate py36zl
</code></pre>
<p>And then execute the shell script <code>install_csi_futures_data.sh</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ./install_csi_futures_data.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This shell script will install or overwrite the file <code>$HOME/.zipline/extension.py</code>. In case you use zipline only for working with the …</p></article></div>

                    <p>When you started your hunt for a new project management software, you most likely considered several tools. And now, you’re weighing in the pros and cons of Asana vs Trello.</p><p>As someone who has used both the tools extensively for several periods, I’m going to go in-depth to help you decide which tool you should pick for your team.</p><p>Let’s jump in.</p><hr><h2 id="asana-vs-trello">Asana vs Trello</h2><p>Asana takes a task-oriented approach to project management where the main unit of work is a task. Trello is a project management software where everything is a card. It mimics a real-life Kanban Board that you’d have with sticky notes on different columns.</p><p>Trello is simple and easy to use. But you’re likely to feel like you’ve hit a wall as your team expands. Asana on the other hand is relatively harder to get started but has more capabilities than Trello.</p><p>Before we jump into the details, let’s take a quick overview of Asana and Trello.</p><hr><h2 id="quick-overview-of-trello">Quick Overview of Trello</h2><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-logo.png" alt="Trello logo" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-logo.png 600w"></figure><p>Trello was founded in 2011 and launched in Techcrunch Disrupt. Founded by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> and Michael Pryor, Trello quickly became popular among many teams and individuals alike.</p><p>In 2017, Atlassian, the maker of JIRA, acquired Trello. After all, a lot of development teams would often compare <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/jira-vs-trello/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">Trello vs JIRA</a>, begin using Trello, but naturally switch to JIRA when they need more functionalities. However, this is changing. With tools like <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">Zepel</a> having a perfect balance between Trello and JIRA, more teams are less inclined to use JIRA.</p><p>When it was founded, Trello was possibly the only tool that took a radically different approach to project management. Instead of focussing on projects, Trello decided to focus more on the workflow of the task. This meant, Trello had only three things — Boards, Lists (or Columns), and Cards.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-board.png" alt="Trello board" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-board.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-board.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-board.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-board.png 1999w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Trello Board</figcaption></figure><p>Since Trello mimics an actual <a href="https://zepel.io/agile/kanban/what-are-kanban-boards/">Kanban Board</a>, it gives teams the flexibility to consider each board as a project by itself. Columns represent the statuses through which each card would flow through. And the actual discussions and collaboration happen inside the card.</p><p>In plain words, if you or your team used a Kanban Board with sticky notes at your office (when people used to go to offices), then using Trello will be super easy for you.</p><p>The visual approach to project management by Trello enables you and your team to quickly see “<em>who is doing what</em>”.</p><p>By organizing your Trello board by different statuses of progress, you can move each card from one column to another as progress is made on that specific task.</p><p>For example, if you’re using Trello for web development, you might name each column as “<em>Todo</em>”, “<em>Prioritized</em>”, “<em>In Progress</em>”, “<em>Reviewed</em>”, and “<em>Done</em>”. You’d add each task under the “<em>Todo</em>” column and as you make progress on each task, you’d move it from one status to another till it’s moved to “<em>Done</em>”. </p><p>Of course, you can choose to edit the names of the columns to meet your team’s needs.</p><p>When you want to have discussions, set due dates, assign a card to a teammate, add labels, upload attachments, and descriptions, you can open up each card to add them.</p><hr><h2 id="quick-overview-of-asana">Quick Overview of Asana</h2><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-logo.png" alt="Asana logo" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-logo.png 600w"></figure><p>Asana was started by former Facebook founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</a> and early Facebook employee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rosenstein">Justin Rosenstein</a> in 2008. It was kept in private beta for almost four years before they launched commercially for the public in April 2012.</p><p>Asana is centred around projects. Within each project you create, you can create sections to categorize tasks. Each task can have subtasks, descriptions, assignees, tags, comments, and custom fields.</p><p>However, if you want to view a nestled view of all the tasks and subtasks, that is not possible.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-boards.png" alt="Boards in Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/asana-boards.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/asana-boards.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/asana-boards.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Boards in Asana</figcaption></figure><p>After you’ve selected/created a project, you can create tasks by clicking on the plus button from the top. To add other details to the task, clicking on the specific task will open its details panel from the right of your screen. This detailed view of the task will also have a timeline of all the activities of the tasks.</p><p>You can choose to view these tasks either in List, Board, Timeline, or Calendar view. All comments and other notifications related to the project are collected in a separate tab inside Asana called the “Inbox”.</p><hr><h2 id="views-and-other-features">Views and other features</h2><p>Trello primarily being a <a href="https://zepel.io/kanban-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">kanban software</a>, doesn’t come with any other views built-in. All you’ve got is a kanban board view and that’s it. If you want other views such as Gantt or calendar, you can choose to use one of their 3rd-party “power-ups”. However, there are no power-ups to view everything in one single list. And you might end up paying a lot for it (more on this later).</p><p>Asana, on the other hand, has several views baked-in to the product. It comes with views such as List, Board, Calendar, and Timeline (Gantt). But their pricing plans restrict you to List, Board, and Calendar views on the free plan.</p><p>Of course, other features such as assignees, due dates, comments, tags, file attachments, and integrations are available on both Asana and Trello. You should note that only Trello allows you to add multiple assignees for a task similar to <a href="https://zepel.io/">Zepel</a>.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Purely based on the number of features and views available, Asana is a clear winner compared to Trello.</p><hr><h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><p>First things first. I’m sure you’re already aware of this, but I thought I should mention it anyway. You shouldn’t have to choose project management primarily based on pricing and sacrifice your team’s productivity.</p><p>If you’re getting more capabilities out of a tool and your team requires those capabilities to perform at their best, then a few $$ shouldn’t come in their way. But of course, if the capabilities of a <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/free-project-management-software/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">free project management software</a> are good enough for your team for now, then great!</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s compare the pricing of Trello vs Asana.</p><h3 id="trello-pricing">Trello Pricing</h3><p>Much like many project management tools, Trello also follows a freemium pricing model. They provide you with a certain set of basic features for free. But when you need more capabilities and power, you’ll have to start paying them.</p><p>Trello’s pricing starts at <strong>$0 with a limited set of features</strong> and works its way up to <strong>$9.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$12.50 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). Trello’s enterprise plan starts at <strong>$17.50 per member per month</strong>.</p><p>A point to note about Trello’s free plan is it’s <strong>free for unlimited users</strong>. They begin per user to charge only when you need more features.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png" alt="Pricing comparison Asana vs Trello" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-trello-pricing.png 2260w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Trello pricing</figcaption></figure><p>As you start using Trello more frequently, you’re likely to want to use their premium features and end up paying for it. Some features you might want to pay for include higher limits on file attachments, custom fields, and more number of power-ups.</p><p>For example, on the free plan, you can use only one power-up per board. This can become tricky if you want to add more views like Calendar or Gantt using Trello’s power-ups. Not only will pay extra for Trello to use more power-ups, but you might also have pay to the 3rd parties who built the power-ups.</p><h3 id="asana-pricing">Asana Pricing</h3><p>Asana’s pricing plans also follow a freemium model.</p><p>Asana’s pricing starts at <strong>$0 for a limited set of features for 15 members.</strong> Its premium plan costs <strong>$10.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$13.49 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). Business plan costs <strong>$24.99 per member per month</strong> (when paid annually) or <strong>$30.49 per member per month</strong> (when paid monthly). If you want an enterprise plan, you’ll have to contact their sales team.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png" alt="Comparing pricing of Trello vs Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 1600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-asana-pricing.png 2272w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Asana pricing</figcaption></figure><p>At first sight, it looks like Asana charges about a dollar more than Trello. However, you should also keep in mind that Asana’s free plan does come with more features compared to Trello.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Draw. Considering the number of features and capabilities that comes from the two tools for at a price that’s nearly the same, it’s hard to pick one over the other.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Keep in mind that while Asana is free to use for 15 members when you add your 16th member, you’ll be charged for all 16 members on the premium plan. Trello’s pricing is also similar.</p><p>Zepel, on the other hand, is free forever for the first 5 members. When you add your 6th member, you’ll be charged only for the 6th member and not for the first five.</p><hr><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Collaboration in both Trello and Asana are pretty straightforward. Both tools have the usual collaboration-focussed features like descriptions, assignees, due dates, tags, comments, and file attachments.</p><p>Trello allows you to collaborate with an unlimited number of users even if you’re on the free plan. This, of course, is a huge bonus for small teams who might not need a lot of features.</p><p>Asana limits you to 15 members on the free plan even if you don’t want to use their premium features. Unlike Trello which allows you to <strong>upload up to 250MB per file</strong> (at least if you upgrade), <strong>Asana only allows a maximum limit of 100MB per file</strong> even on a higher paid plan.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Trello is a clear winner over Asana thanks to them allowing an unlimited number of collaborators even on the free plan.</p><hr><h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2><p>Among all collaboration specific features, dependencies have to be one of the most important ones in a project management tool.</p><p>Trello, unfortunately, doesn’t have capabilities that allow you to mark dependencies between cards. This is where Asana beats Trello.</p><p>Asana lets you add dependencies between tasks and view them on a timeline (Gantt). This timeline view is especially useful when you want to manage conflicts between dependencies.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png" alt="Trello vs Asana: Dependencies in Asana" srcset="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 600w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 1000w, https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/trello-vs-asana-dependencies.png 1300w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dependencies in Asana</figcaption></figure><p>However, you must keep in mind that unlike Zepel, <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/working-with-teams/dependencies/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-vs-trello">dependencies</a> in Asana is not available in the free plan. Asana users can use dependencies only if they subscribe to a premium or higher paid plans.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Comparing Asana vs Trello, the clear winner when it comes to managing dependencies is Asana.</p><hr><h2 id="user-experience-and-ease-of-use">User experience and ease of use</h2><p>Both Trello and Asana have invested a great deal into building software that’s easy to use and has a great user experience.</p><p>Trello, as you might already know, is known for its ease of use.

<h2><strong>FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.</strong></h2>



<p>VIMAGE was first presented in the Paper <a href="https://papers.freebsd.org/2003/zec-vimage/">“Implementing a Clonable Network Stack in the FreeBSD Kernel” by Macro Zec in 2003</a> and VIMAGE code appeared first in FreeBSD 8.0, however it wasn’t until FreeBSD 12.0 that VIMAGE was built into FreeBSD GENERIC kernels and it is a bit of an overlooked feature.</p>



<p>If you have used jails before you might wonder what more VNET jails offer or why you would want to migrate from using localhost-based networking. VNET jails give each jail its own isolated copy of the network stack. They get everything from the IP layer up, creating a network stack that is entirely its own, almost anything you could do with a distinct host you can do with a jail and VNET.</p>



<p>VNET network stacks can be given interfaces from the host and once an interface has been delegated into a VNET jail it disappears from the view of the host, becoming only visible in the jail. FreeBSD offers the epair interface that acts as a virtual Ethernet cable. Give one end of an epair to a VNET jail and keep the other end in the host and you have a way to network between the host and the jail or even between multiple jails. Unlike normal jail networking a VNET jail is able to fully use the interface and once given the correct permissions it can perform packet captures and traces as if it were a full host.</p>



<p>VNET allows jails to be closer to full virtual machines with much less overhead and they offer the ability to test networking in isolation with a very similar environment to the jail host.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET with a jail</strong></h4>



<p>The best way to experiment with VNET is to create some test jails and play with their networks. With VNET it is easy and cheap to create a new separate network that will not interfere with the hosts configuration.</p>



<p>First to demonstrate the power the VNET provides we will create a simple jail that only isolates networking from the host. If we run the following three commands on a FreeBSD system we can create a simple jail:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=emptyjail persist vnet
    host # jexec emptyjail /bin/sh
    emptyjail # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8008&lt;LOOPBACK,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384
    options=680003&lt;RXCSUM,TXCSUM,LINKSTATE,RXCSUM_IPV6,TXCSUM_IPV6&gt;
    groups: lo
    nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>The important flags to the jail command here are <em>persist</em> and <em>vnet</em>, <em>persist</em> keeps the jail around even though nothing is running inside of it, <em>vnet</em> creates the jail with its own VIMAGE network stack.</p>



<p>The jail we have created contains a loop back interface (lo0) but cannot see any of the interfaces from the host, it has been isolated at the network and process level. Because we do not specify a new root to use for the jails file system, it can see everything on the host file system as before, this can be really handy when you are developing and running tests that take advantage of VNET.</p>



<p>For our jail to be useful we need to be able to access network interfaces, VNET jails can be given any interface and once given to a jail they vanish from the view of the host network stack. When we want to network between the host and the jail we can use an epair(4) device. epair devices are a pair of Ethernet-like interfaces connected back to back, sort of like an emulated patch cable. Each side is denoted with a letter, they come as an ‘a’ and a ‘b’ part. If we create an epair and move one half into the jail, once it is configured we can communicate from the host to the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # ja    host # ifconfig epair create
    epair0a
    host # ifconfig
    lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 16384

<p>This time when we create our jail we delegate one half of the epair to it. We need to configure the interface in the jail and on the host. Once we have the interfaces configured we can communicate between the host and jail (Note: when you delegate an interface to a jail all the configuration will be erased. You must configure the interface once it is inside the jail).</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=networkjail persist vnet vnet.interface=epair0b

    networkjail # ifconfig

</code></pre>



<p>Python3 is installed on the host and as our jail doesn’t isolate the file system, all installed software is also available to the jail. We can use the http server built in to python3 to demonstrate a simple network service running inside the jail.</p>



<pre><code>    host # jexec networkjail sh -c "cd /usr/src; python3 -m http.server" 
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
</code></pre>



<p>With this a web browser on the host machine can be pointed at 192.0.2.2:8000 and we can browse around the structure of the FreeBSD source tree that lives in /usr/src. We can run any service that will run on a FreeBSD host from within this VNET jail. The difference here between older jail networking is that we can do anything with the epair that we could do with a real network interface such as place add it to a bridge.</p>



<p>When we remove networkjail the half of the epair that was delegated is returned to the host:</p>



<pre><code>    host # ifconfig epair0b
    ifconfig: interface epair0b does not exist
    host # jls -v
       JID  Hostname                      Path
            Name                          State
            CPUSetID
            IP Address(es)
         1                                /
            networkjail                   ACTIVE
            3
    host # jail -r networkjail
    host # ifconfig epair0b
    epair0b: flags=8842&lt;BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; metric 0 mtu 1500
            options=8&lt;VLAN_MTU&gt;
            ether 02:c5:7b:f8:1e:0b
            groups: epair
            media: Ethernet 10Gbase-T (10Gbase-T &lt;full-duplex&gt;)
            status: active
            nd6 options=21&lt;PERFORMNUD,AUTO_LINKLOCAL&gt;
</code></pre>



<p>When we destroy either half of the epair both halves will be removed from the system, even if the side delegated to a jail.</p>



<p>VNET offers a facility for local testing with a network segment that is very similar to a real network. It is possible to perform any action from the host as you would on a non-virtual network interface such as adding it to a bridge or firewalling.</p>



<h4><strong>Using VNET to isolate networks</strong></h4>



<p>We are not limited to using virtual interfaces when using VNET, but are able to delegate any interface on the host into the VNET. VNET opens up the opportunity to isolate out chunks of networks allowing us to build complex topologies such as soft routers and firewalls.</p>



<p>We can also use the isolation offered by VNET to offer services from a host on a particular interface that might be undesirable or destructive or if the address space that a piece of equipment uses clashes with the network that the host is on.</p>



<p>On this development machine we have network interfaces on two different networks, one is in the development environment and the other lives in the sandbox testing environment. Never can packets go between the two. The sandbox testing network is where virtual machines live, normally these bhyve machines are configured with a tap interface and they join the network via a bridge interface on the host. VNET allows us to do the same thing, but with jails.</p>



<p>Before we start we need to load the kernel modules for epair and bridge on the host, they normally load automatically on the host when you try to use them, but the jail is unable to do this.</p>



<pre><code>    host # kldload if_epair if_bridge</code></pre>



<p>VNET also allows us to give a physical network interface on the development host to a jail and from that jail create further sub VNET jails that are isolated from the hosts network:</p>



<pre><code>    host # jail -c name=isojail persist vnet vnet.interface=em0 children.max=1</code></pre>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>After our team successfully <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/T8012#Bootrom_Exploits">ported</a> the <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit">checkm8</a> exploit to the AppleSilicon T2 chip, we began exploring methods for closed-case hardware debugging, or CCD, as found on other iDevices. On such devices, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/debug-visibility-and-trace/coresight-architecture/serial-wire-debug">Serial Wire Debug</a> protocol can be muxed out across the Lightning connector, which we presumed was replicable across the USB Type-C connector. With some assistance from easily obtainable schematics for our MacBook models, we have determined that muxing is handled by an Apple/TI co-designed <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-type-cr-port-controller-interface-specification">USB Type-C Port Controller</a>, colloquially known as "ACE". The following details our findings and the vendor defined protocol, termed AppleVDM, Apple has implemented over the USB Power Delivery standard for muxing out various internal peripherals.</p><p>A member of our team, @h0m3us3r has dumped the ACE firmware by attaching a SWD probe onto exposed test points on the logic board of a MacBook Pro. Thanks to this we were able to obtain both the ROM and the firmware payload patch applied over it and discover that the ACE chip contains a <code><a href="https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m0">Cortex-M0 r0p1</a></code> ARM core. Most of the static analysis was later conducted by @mrarm.</p><pre><code>Connecting to target via SWD

<center>Segger J-Link Probe output when attached to ACE2 (CD3217).</center><h2 id="ace-overview">ACE Overview</h2><p>To better understand the inner-workings of ACE, we began looking for identifying information within the dumped firmware. We found the string <code>CD3217 &nbsp; HW0022 FW002.032.00 ZACE2-J213</code> and upon searching <code>CD3217</code> online resulted in the similar <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65986.pdf">TI TPS65986</a>. Based on how similar the functional description of the aforementioned TI USB Type-C Controller is to ACE, and considering that TI co-designed ACE with Apple, it was reasonable to assume most of the technical information applies to ACE.</p><p>TI's USB Type-C Controllers expose an I²C interface for host management, for which we found the excellent <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slvuan1a/slvuan1a.pdf">Host Interface Technical Reference Manual</a>, documenting a multitude of public I²C registers and commands.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image.png 1000w, https://blog.t8012.dev/content/images/2020/12/image.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>TPS65986 Functional Block Diagram</figcaption></figure><p>The primary component of focus based on the above block diagram is the digital core, which communicates directly with the host and runs the firmware we dumped previously. As mentioned, the core is based on a <code>Cortex-M0 r0p1</code>. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a complete memory map with peripherals as TI does not release public information on the core itself. Regardless, we have the basic memory layout as follows:</p><p>Since we weren't sure whether the code for muxing out things lives in the ACE or somewhere else (there are registers for receiving vendor messages and processing them on another chip), we also investigated the firmware of chips that can directly communicate with the ACE, the SMC, part of T2 SoC, and the Thunderbolt controller. While we obtained and analyzed the I2C usages in the SMC firmware and found no suspicious code whatsoever, we had issues with analyzing the Thunderbolt controller firmware and decided to only reverse engineer it as a last resort. We initially thought that the only way that we could talk with the ACE from Mac OS (Intel) was by modifying the SMC firmware to relay commands to the ACE. While we have successfully managed to edit the SMC firmware and talk with the ACE, it turned out that this effort wasn't needed. Later we stumbled upon the following project: <a href="https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher">https://github.com/osy/ThunderboltPatcher</a>, which uses the AppleHPM kext in order to communicate with the ACE.</p><p>The AppleHPM KEXT allows a user space program running as root to read and write ACE registers. It also has several interesting methods that seem to be intended for reading and writing registers on ACEs connected using a USB Type-C cable to the DUT. Unfortunately, while we tried invoking them, we didn't manage to get these methods working, suggesting that either they have been disabled on production hardware or need some more preparation work in order to work. We also discovered that there exists an EFI mode firmware updater for the ACE called <code>HPMUtil.efi</code>, which we also partially reverse engineered. There seems to be several methods of updating the ACEs depending on the hardware revision; the EFI program also seems to have an argument that makes it update externally connected ACEs, however at least for recent ACEs it seems to be broken; the only update route that would work on the firmware dump we obtained from our Mac (based on available commands) seems to be hardcoded in a few places to run commands on the local ACE.</p><p>There are at least 3 known revisions of the ACE chip. Based on hardware available to us, the first variant, ACE1, is known to be used in 2018 and older T2 models, the second, ACE2, in 2019 and newer T2 models, and the third in 2020 M1 enabled laptops. The software update method differs significantly between ACE1 and ACE2. At the time of writing the article, we have only successfully dumped a single ACE firmware (ACE2) and all the analysis here is based on that version.</p><h2 id="usb-pd">USB PD</h2><p>The logical channel for telling the Mac to mux out something other than USB from the chip would be USB PD, since ACE's main communication vector with external devices is USB PD and because controlling data lines using USB PD is a widespread practice (see: MIPI debug interface as well as this article on getting UART off an Samsung phone: <a href="https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf">https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2632162/bookchapter.pdf</a>). This TI-derived controller can be configured to support some variant of MIPI debug mode by default (and the MIPI debug ID is present in the Apple ACE firmware as well), however as we discovered later it is disabled in Apple's configuration and can not be used. As such, we decided to look for other Vendor Defined Messages that the ACE understands.</p><p>In the USB PD protocol, entering a vendor mode begins by sending a SVID (Standard ID or Vendor ID, usually the vendor's USB VID) and object position (think of it as a sub mode that the vendor can define). By analyzing the ACE firmware we found at least 3 possible object positions under the Apple SVID, however their availability is dynamic and by default only a single SVID and object position is available. This primary mode is, for example, used when the Apple's charger is connected. We are not sure when the other modes are activated and plan to do further work related to figuring out what the purpose of these other modes is.</p><p>Since it would be logical if there was a reply for the command for entering a mode and also because reverse engineering an embedded firmware with no context whatsoever is hard, we decided to look into the <code>VDMs</code> command, which can be used to send a VDM PD message. This allowed us to gather important information about the firmware's inner workings and also to find a few functions that sent a message with Apple's vendor ID. We investigated several of these, some of them were indeed related to the protocol used with the charger (which we aren't sure what the purpose of is; however from what it seems it can be only used to read some memory sections from the external device), but we also found another procedure that had three cases, two of which replied with 16-bit values (created from information from a particular memory area) in a similar way to the Discover SVIDs VDM, and one of them was complex and handled additional logic. We investigated it further and eventually managed to use it to mux things out of the controller.</p><p>Another possible use of the <code>VDMs</code> command can be found in the AppleHPM KEXT and the <code>HPLUtil.efi</code> program, which is reading registers from externally connected devices. Since we haven't given much attention to it as it was not our goal and our experiments were a failure, we are not going to describe it in this article.</p><p>Note that since SWD can also be muxed from the ACE, further reverse engineering ACE modes is not that interesting; you should be able to use the ACE's SWD to trigger any mux choice of your choosing and directly talk to all peripherals ACE has access to.</p><h2 id="dive-into-the-code">Dive into the code</h2><p>With @h0m3us3r's dump of ROM and RAM memory, we started by loading the ACE firmware in IDA. The reset handler address is present at <code>0x00000004</code> and can be used to get the address of the entrypoint.</p><p>The command table can be trivially found by looking for the 4 character codes. Register table requires a bit more effort but is also not hard to find (since there is a register that is a string, you can find what references it). In comparison to the public TI documentation, there are substantially more commands and registers available, some of which are Apple-specific additions. Since the firmware has barely any strings or debug information, the command list has been very helpful.</p><p>After initially exploring the firmware we quickly stumbled upon cursed looking trampolines such as the following:</p><pre><code>ROM:000266C2 _Command_HRST                           ; DATA XREF: ROM:commandsâ†“o

<p>Pay no attention to all those nasty left-wing allegations about how military contractors collude and conspire with the Pentagon to warp our economy, impoverish our citizens, pervert our national goals, and foment needless bloody wars that slaughter millions in order to fatten corporate profits. The truth is actually much worse than you could ever imagine—as this <a href="https://www.claritypress.com/product/understanding-the-war-industry/">chilling new book</a> by Christian Sorensen makes startlingly clear.</p>



<p>Rather than simply having what President Dwight Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex, we actually have a military-industrial-<em>congressional</em> complex, with a media and academic adjunct. </p>



<blockquote><p>The network of overseas military bases extends to remote regions of the world, which were traditionally the domain of other imperial powers. </p></blockquote>

<p>Since the creation of AFRICOM in 2007, for example, the U.S. military has obtained an outpost in Mali, drone bases in Niger, Djibouti, the Seychelles and Kenya, National Security Agency (NSA) facilities in Ethiopia, and flies drones over war-ravaged Libya and Somalia.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is today one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, having been exempted from the 1998 Kyoto protocol and Paris climate change agreement (when the U.S. was abiding by it). There are also now at least 39,000 contaminated military sites across the U.S. and growing numbers of species threatened with extinction and people sickened by the toxic residues of American weapons systems.</p>



<p>In 2018, the top-five war corporations made more than $16 billion at a time when 500,000 Americans were homeless on an average every day. To sustain their obscene profits, they spend millions lobbying Capitol Hill and divvy out millions in campaign contributions to Congress. In 2012 alone, war corporations gave around $30 million and $25.5 million in 2014.</p>



<blockquote><p>Much of this money has gone to appropriation and armed services committees, which rubber stamp gargantuan military budgets that amount to more than the total of the next ten countries combined.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Rhode Island’s Jack Reed (D), characteristically took money from General Dynamics, Raytheon, Textron, Apollo Global Management (a private equity firm heavy into war industry) and large investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, and used his position to help Textron win a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-textron-bombs-idUSBRE97J0ZF20130820">U.S. contract</a>&nbsp;valued at $641 million to build 1,300 cluster bombs for Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>James Inhofe, Oklahoma’s Republican climate-change denying Senator who has headed the committee under Donald Trump, has taken donations from Boeing, General Dynamics, Honeywell, Huntington-Ingalls, and Orbital TK, along with over $338,000 in the last five years from the oil and gas industry, which profits significantly from overseas military intervention and huge military budgets that Inhofe has always championed.</p>

<p>Besides a corrupted Congress, the military-industrial complex is sustained by the revolving door of Generals who transition from high-ranking military posts to the executive boards of defense contractors where they lobby for ever higher military budgets. James Mattis characteristically went from Commander of the U.S. Central Command to a member of the board of General Dynamics, where he swore before Congress that reduced military spending was a threat to U.S. national security, to appointment in January 2017 as Secretary of Defense, where he oversaw increases in weapons sales and the U.S. war budget. Other high-ranking officials, like former CIA Director John Brennan, have found lucrative jobs peddling new wars on television or in think tanks financed by military corporations.</p>







<p>Sorensen writes that, after pumping the War on Terror for trillions in military spending, the war industry is now “returning to targeting Russia and China through ‘Great Power competition.’” This has “given the Pentagon an excuse to deploy more corporatized troops, mercenaries and goods and services right up to Russia’s borders, while Pentagon leadership has stylized such a permanent war footing as conducive to peace.”</p>



<blockquote><p>The U.S. Executive Branch has meanwhile come to take on the function of an international arms peddler.</p></blockquote>



<p>On any given day, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages 14,000 open foreign military sales cases with 185 countries. The latter include some of the most oppressive on the planet like Israel, which systematically oppresses the Palestinians, using weapons manufactured by Boeing, Caterpillar, General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Motorola and Northrop Grumman, and Saudi Arabia, which has used hardware from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to pulverize Yemen.</p>



<p>From May 2015 through March 2016, American war corporations sold over $30 billion worth of goods and services also to anti-democratic Gulf allies such as the United Arab Emirates, which waged the dirty war in Yemen by proxy and was known for the brutal suppression of dissenting groups. In the Southern Hemisphere, U.S. military and corporate action yielded devastating costs in countries like Honduras and Colombia, where aerial defoliation programs have poisoned the landscape and paramilitary death squads have terrorized trade union activists and supporters of the left-wing Fuerzas Armada Revolucionario de Colombia (FARC) whose principal platform is to redistribute land and wealth.</p>

<p>By law, the U.S. is not allowed to sell weapons to regimes that come to power through coup d’états. However, the war industry successfully lobbied the government not to recognize blatant coups, like that in Egypt in 2013 and Ukraine in 2014. The war industry at the same time does everything in its power to sustain conflicts like in the Koreas, where it profits from an endless military standoff.</p>

<p>It is also in the process of provoking new ones through the Asia Pivot policy that has resulted in the military encirclement of China, promotion of NATO expansion towards Russia’s borders, and deployment of missile technology in Poland and Romania aimed directly at Russia. The inauguration of a $1.74 trillion nuclear modernization effort could ultimately lead humanity down the road to apocalypse.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of Sorensen’s contributions is to show how the war industry sustains a progressive veneer by stressing its “green initiatives” and the diversity of its workforce.</p></blockquote>



<p>John Brennan’s tenure as CIA Director from 2013 to 2017 was marked by his extending new opportunities for African Americans, and many CEOs are now women, like Marilyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin who was voted as “Forbes” most powerful woman in business for three years in a row. Hewson’s feminism, however, does not go very far if we consider her praise for the Saudi regime, which systematically persecutes women, or support for wars which kill women and children, and destroy families.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Pentagon—which Sorensen rightfully calls the “War Department”—failed an audit of more than 2.7 trillion dollars in assets. The accounting firms carrying out the audit concluded that the Pentagon’s financial records were “riddled with so many bookkeeping deficiencies, irregularities and errors that a reliable audit was simply impossible.”</p>



<p>Franklin “Chuck” Spinney, a former Pentagon employee, pointed out a pertinent accounting trick where the Pentagon routinely overestimates inflation rates for weapons systems and does not return the excess funds to the Treasury when actual inflation rates turn out to be lower. Tricks like this result in surplus slush funds which are used to fund shady covert military operations in places like sub-Saharan Africa, whose mineral wealth multi-national corporations covet.</p>



<p>The Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965) once stated that “we live in an era of the scientific savage, where all the wisdom of science, mathematics and physics are used for the purpose of assassination.” These remarks were made before the popularization of the drone, one of the war industry’s favorite products, which has been used to kill at least 8,000 people.</p>

<p>A good first step toward challenging the power of the war industry would be a program of peace education that would create a broader awareness of its harmful activities among the U.S. electorate. Unfortunately, the American educational system has been corrupted and conditions kids from a young age to go along with the status quo. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests forced the removal of military-related research from major universities, but such research returned with a vengeance starting with the budgetary cutbacks of the 1980s and then as part of the War on Terror. Professors now compete with one another for grants that …</p></div></div>

<p>Sometimes secondhand books can come into our possession in ways that make it quite clear they need us to read them.</p>
<p>Such was the case with&nbsp;<em>Le fascisme italien</em>&nbsp;by Pierre Milza and Serge Berstein, (1) which reached me by means of a random sequence of events including a friend moving flat, an unexpected traffic jam and a small public park on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
<p>It did not disappoint and, as I am about to explain in more detail, helped me to see a number of crucial issues more clearly.</p>
<p>Firstly, it confirmed that, despite constant claims to the contrary, fascism was not at all anti-capitalist, but extremely pro-capitalist.</p>
<p>Secondly, it presented interesting parallels with the Coronavirus-linked totalitarian mindset so dominant in 2020, which I am calling ‘newnormalism’.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it sparked some wider reflection on my part about the participation of most of the left in this 21st century authoritarianism and how that relates to my own anti-fascist position.</p>
<p><strong>FASCISM AND CAPITALISM</strong></p>
<p>It is well known, I think, that Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator, began his political career on the left and, when he started building a movement immediately after the First World War, the initial programme that attracted support was left-wing, with anarchist influences.</p>
<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Milza-and-Berstein-543x900.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="552"></figure>
</div>
<p>However, as Milza and Berstein make abundantly clear, this prototype fascism was quickly and drastically ditched as Mussolini realised the only way he was going to gain the power he craved was with the support of capitalists and big landowners.</p>
<p>Much much later, at the end of the Second World War, in a desperate last-ditch attempt to rally the Italian people behind them in the face of defeat, the hardcore fascist Saló republic rediscovered their socialist side, but it was all hopelessly too late.</p>
<p>Having lived through the fascist&nbsp;<em>ventennio</em>&nbsp;(20 years), the population were not going to fall for any more redwashing attempts or superficial anti-bourgeois posturing. They had seen clearly that fascism in power defended the interests of Capital, rather than the people.</p>
<p>The authors trace this story back to 1910, when the Italian Nationalist Association was founded with “the support of certain business circles, in particular that of heavy industry”, (2) who had a very obvious direct vestes interest in promoting the nationalist call for Italian participation in the approaching war in Europe.</p>
<p>It was Mussolini’s sudden support for Italy going to war (on the Allied side), that led to him being thrown out of the socialist party, the PSI, splitting from others on the left. This left him ideally placed to benefit from capitalist funding, though it is not clear whether his conversion to the war cause was actually motivated by this consideration.</p>
<p>It is known that Mussolini received money from the French government and from pro-war businessmen like Filippo Naldi.</p>
<p>The first fascist general assembly in 1919 took place in a hall in Milan lent by a group of wealthy capitalists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascism benefited greatly from the ruling classes’ fear of a Bolshevik-style revolution in Italy, with post-war waves of strikes and a rural movement which reclaimed land from rich property owners.</p>
<p>Explain the authors: “The fear born in the world of the country landowners as a result of the land occupation movement greatly outlived the phenomenon itself and helped pushed them into the arms of fascism, through fear of a challenge to property rights”. (3)</p>
<p>Business organisations such as&nbsp;<em>Confagricoltura</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Confindustria</em>&nbsp;were set up to defend capitalism. Fascism was happy to win favour by providing them with foot soldiers, squadristi, who physically attacked trade unionists and leftists in a wave of “preventative counter-revolution”. (4)</p>
<p>This, say Milza and Berstein, represented fascism’s big break and funds started to roll in from business, banks and big landowners.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fascists started receiving the support of local authorities, the army and the police in their fight against leftist ‘subversion’. They were the system’s emergency weapon against the threat of revolution.</p>
<p>“Prefects, magistrates and officers of the Carabinieri, let the fascists carry on and assure them of impunity. The moment that the State started to crumble, the bourgeoisie, so frightened by the popular uprising of 1919-20, lent their support to fascism’s reactionary violence”. (5)</p>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/squadristi.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Fascist squadristi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In November 1920, for instance, violent fascist squads descended on Bologna, where the radical left had gained control of the local council. There were nine deaths and more than 100 injuries.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the next couple of years, they smashed up trade union and co-operative HQs and attacked working-class districts, wielding clubs and revolvers to force strikers back to work.</p>
<p>By now the fascists had stopped pretending to be left-wing and were openly singing the praises of capitalism and economic liberalism. (6)</p>
<blockquote><p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Mussolini himself set before the future party a manfesto which no longer owed anything to the leftist tendencies of 1919. In the economic realm it was absolute liberalism, with the State indulging in no intervention or nationalisation, or any fiscal measures deemed ‘populist’. On the political and social side, a strong State was to be created, capable of imposing the ban on strikes in the public sector”. (7)</p>
<p>This was authoritarian capitalism, meant to please “the big money interests from whom Mussolini was now seeking political and financial backing”. (8)</p>
<p>As the future dictator said himself: “We are liberal economically, but we will never be so politically”. (9) This was a question of sacrificing political liberalism in the interests of economic liberalism, aka capitalism. (10) (<em>For more on the little-appreciated similarities between fascism and liberalism, see&nbsp;<a href="https://orgrad.wordpress.com/articles/liberalism-the-two-faced-tyranny-of-wealth/">this article</a>&nbsp;on the orgrad website</em>)</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/mussolini-rally2.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="359"></figure>
<p>Once the fascists were in power, the clamp-down on opposition was ruthless. Strikes were banned and workers found themselves defenceless against their bosses.</p>
<p>Fascist economic policies were all in the interests of the ruling class. When finance minister Alberto De Stefani reformed the tax system in 1923 this “was above all to the profit of the rich”. (11)</p>
<p>He offered tax breaks for foreign investors, did away with the “red tape” of bodies controlling food prices and rents, ended state funding for co-operatives and halted land reforms which threatened the interests of rich landowners.</p>
<p>After 1925, in the face of economic crisis, the pure economic liberalism of the Manchester School went out of the window, in favour of state intervention.</p>
<p>But this was intervention in the interests of business and Capital, not in the interests of the Italian people whom fascism mendaciously claimed to represent!</p>
<p>‘Development’ was at the forefront of fascist plans, as is the case with all industrial capitalists. More land was cultivated and an infrastructure of roads, new towns and industrial estates was built.</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Turin-Milan-autostrada.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>“A vast programme of public works was undertaken, carried out by private firms, who were offered lucrative contracts by the State. Electrification of the rail system began, with the construction of tunnels on the Rome-Naples and Bologna-Florence lines. A massive roadbuilding programme was entrusted to ANAS (Azienda Nazionale Autonoma delle Strade), created in 1928, which oversaw the showcase construction of big toll motorways, the first in Europe”. (12)</p>
<p>This was nothing other than a bailing-out of the capitalist economy by the pro-business fascist state, for which the cost would ultimately have to be borne by the public.</p>
<p>Ring any bells in 2020?</p>
<p>Banks were also treated to fascist largesse, notably BCI, saved by the Italian state with a massive influx of money.</p>
<p>Note the authors: “There was neither socialisation nor nationalisation. The State became capitalist; it guaranteed the property of most of the shareholders and their future dividends. The only socialisation was that of the losses, assumed by the public purse”. (13)</p>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://network23.org/paulcudenec/files/2020/07/Istituto-Mobiliare-Italiano.jpg" alt=""></figure>
</div>
<p>In 1931, Mussolini even set up a body,&nbsp;<em>L’Istituto mobiliare italiano</em>, with the role of helping businesses in financial trouble, declaring that this was “a means of energetically driving the Italian economy towards its corporative phase, which is to say a system which fundamentally respects private property and initiative, but ties them tightly to the State, which alone can protect, control and nourish them”. (14)</p>
<p>But the emphasis was very much on the big businesses and financiers allied with the fascist regime. Economic crisis saw numerous small and medium-sized firms go to the wall or gobbled up by big companies, as the fascist state aided this concentration of wealth into ever-fewer hands. (15)</p>
<p>“As for the working classes,” add Milza and Berstein, “they paid the price for this alliance, with unemployment, reduced wages and higher cost of living”. (16)</p>
<p>Fascist corporatism, with its officially-approved phoney trade unions, was supposed to bring together workers and bosses in the interests of the nation, but did nothing of the sort: “It allowed big industry and financial groups to use the State’s arbitration and power of coercion to reinforce their positions and impose their law on their employees”. (17)</p>
<p>“Far from being destroyed by fascism as the first proto-fascist manifesto suggested, Italian capitalism found in it a defender which managed to save it from revolution or collapse and went on to reinforce its structures and its means of action”. (18)</p>
<p>It was not for nothing that the bankers of J.P. Morgan boosted the fascist regime with a $100m loan between 1925 and 1927 (19) or that Winston Churchill praised, during a 1927 visit, Mussolini’s success in defending Italy from what he termed international subversion. He meant the radical left. (20)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>So I've been using the Github flow for some years now from both the maintainer side and contributor side to open source projects. I've also been using the email workflow for git from both sides for about a year now. Using email for git sounded quite horrible before I actually started using it. Now I prefer it so I thought I would document my experience here.</p><h2 id="the-github-flow">The Github flow</h2><p>This isn't strictly for Github, it's the flow many developers are accustomed to:</p><ol><li>Fork the project repo</li><li>Make a change on your fork</li><li>Create a pull request from a branch on your fork to the main repository</li><li>Get comments on the pull request</li><li>Force-push to the same branch to update the state of the pull request</li><li>Somebody clicks merge</li></ol><p>Basically the same flow is also used on Gitlab and the other smaller git hosting services. This flow works reasonably well. It gets slightly more annoying after the first pull request because you actually have to keep your own local branch up to date.</p><p>In theory this also gives some nice discoverability of people working on the project by looking at the forks of the project. In practice this is a bunch of outdated copies of the project by people who have mistaken the fork button for a like button.</p><p>From a maintainer point of view this flow also works alright, unless your project starts to grow. For example when postmarketOS was still on Github we ran into the issue that the merge button isn't really useful. Once you have a reasonable volume of &nbsp;pull requests the branches of those pull requests get outdated quickly meaning they have to be rebased before merging or every change will have an extra merge commit in the history. </p><p>In the postmarketOS case it was decided that merge commits are extra noise in the git history we'd like to avoid so we'd need to rebase things, and to properly rebase we have to do it from the command line because Github can't deal at all with conflicts. Rebasing from the command line also gives a lot more flexibility with squashing and having a nice commit message. </p><p>The only reason that merge button was used on Github was because Github can't seem to mark the pull request as merged if it isn't done by the button. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image.png"><figcaption>The all-knowing button from Github</figcaption></figure><p>The old workflow documentation postmarketOS had when Github was used can be read in the wiki history: <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441">https://wiki.postmarketos.org/index.php?title=Merge_Workflow&amp;oldid=3441</a></p><p>Now we've moved to Gitlab we're basically dealing with the same issue, we have to mess with the commits before merging so we're always force-pushing to the git fork of the author of the pull request (which they have to enable on the merge request, if they don't we first have to tell them to enable that checkbox) and then finally merge them with the button in the web UI so Gitlab doesn't lose track of what happened.</p><h2 id="the-git-send-email-flow">The git-send-email flow</h2><p>The flow for pull requests in github isn't the original way to make pull requests. Since git was originally written for the development of the Linux kernel it has been designed with the workflow of the kernel in mind. The kernel uses mailing lists.</p><p>[insert image of horrified developers here]</p><p>The first patch I emailed was with the assistence of <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">https://git-send-email.io/</a>, I needed to learn how to use the email flow because at the time I was working on my very first kernel patch. This was quite a daunting task involing triple-checking everything against the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html">patch submission documentation</a> for Linux which describes the easy 16 step process.</p><p>Then after the final step the email gets sent out and you wait... for response emails.</p><p>Since then I've made contributions to projects hosted on Sourcehut, which also uses the email workflow, and now I also maintain some projects on this platform. For example <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/megapixels">Megapixels</a>.</p><p>This is the workflow for submitting a patch to a project using the email flow:</p><ol><li>Clone the repository locally</li><li>Make your changes on your local checkout</li><li>Run <code>git send-email</code> with a ref pointing to one or a range of commits</li><li>Get comments as response to the patch as emails, mirrored on the webpage of the mailing list</li><li>Fix up your previous mistakes, run <code>git send-email</code> again with the <code>-v2</code> argument to send an updated version</li><li>The maintainer applies the patch from the email.</li></ol><p>As a maintainer getting the patches like this is quite nice since unless there's a conflict you don't have to merge branches or rebase things, the patches is just ... a patch, it only has the changes from the author, not the full git history.</p><p>Also, one thing to note about the process above is that, except for receiving the feedback, it will never touch your mail client. Git does SMTP itself and make sure the emails you send out are up-to-spec so maintainers can apply the changes directly by feeding the email into <code>git am</code></p><p>If your main complaint is that email is horrible to work with, the issue is most likely not email, it's probably your mail client.</p><p>One of the other main issues with the email workflow is that you can't just see the full state of the "pull request" because there's no nice pull request page to see what's happening. This is one of the main reasons I like the mailing lists on Sourcehut, the patch view fixes most of the visibility issues, for example this simple patch: <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382">https://lists.sr.ht/~martijnbraam/public-inbox/patches/14382</a></p><figure><img src="https://blog.brixit.nl/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png"><figcaption>The overview of a patch submitted to a Sourcehut mailing list</figcaption></figure><p>There you see the patch description in the first block, which is in this case didn't have any extra text added in the <code>git send-email</code> stage, so it only shows a summary of the changes in this patch.</p><p>Below that is the actual patch, with the subject of the patch as header and then showing the full commit message below that if there were more lines and then the full diff. This patch can also be exported directly as a .patch file using the link right of the subject.</p><p>Finally, below the diff is a comment from Eyal who applied this patch to the development branch and thanked the author; the mailing list will generate a nice threaded view here if there's more discussion.</p><p>The block on the right will show the status of the patch, <code>APPLIED</code> in this case and gives some extra tools to get a copy of the full patchset that can be applied using <code>git am</code></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I personally prefer the e-mail workflow now, it saves me from keeping branches/forks up to date as with this workflow only diffs are sent around. Also after working in Gitlab for most of the things I do on postmarketOS I really like how quickly sourcehut pages load and that I just can get all info from the patch without clicking on tabs to switch between comments, diffs and commit messages with loading times in between.</p><p>Also one nice improvement is that instead of doing half the maintainer flow in the browser by clicking things and half by patching stuff up in my local git branch and force pushing that, it just lets me do everything in the shell and then just send an email back telling the author their patch got merged.</p><p>All together people are most likely already used to having all the comments and info emailed to them as notifications, it's just that in the gitlab/hub case it will send you a link to continue on their website and in the sourcehut/email flow case the email is everything you need to continue without ever opening the browser.</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On December 28th, President Donald Trump signed into law an omnibus spending bill allocating $1.4 trillion in federal funding for the 2021 fiscal year. Covering everything from pandemic-relief provisions to defense spending, the massive bill also contains the FY 2021 Intelligence Authorization Act, which codifies U.S. covert and clandestine operations and defines requirements for reporting to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since it was first presented by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee in June, this year’s Intelligence Authorization Act has been of unusual interest thanks to an included provision titled “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In this inclusion, the committee offered intriguing support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence” and requested the production of an unclassified report detailing the analysis of UFOs, or as The Pentagon now terms them, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the recent passing of the Omnibus, seemingly the clock is ticking and The Pentagon’s UAP Task Force now has 180 days to provide the Senate Intelligence Committee with their unclassified report detailing The Pentagon’s current investigations into UFOs. However, easily overlooked, the provision is not law and there is still no guarantee that a comprehensive, “all-source” UAP report will end up seeing the light of day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_97675" width="1170" height="878" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Md7zIXWiTw?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“The newly enacted Intelligence Authorization Act incorporates the Senate Intelligence Committee’s report language calling for an unclassified, all-source report on the UAP phenomenon. This was accomplished in the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the bill,” says Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and former staff Director of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee, who played an integral role in the development of the legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Consequently, it’s now fair to say that the request for an unclassified report on the UAP phenomenon enjoys the support of both parties in both Houses of Congress,” Mellon told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email. “Assuming the Executive Branch honors this important request, the nation will at long last have an objective basis for assessing the validity of the issue and its national security implications. This is an extraordinary and long overdue opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Origins for the Senate Intelligence Committee’s UAP report request can be traced back to December 2017, when the&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">New York Times&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">published an article</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;revealing a secretive study within the Pentagon known as The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). Coinciding with the article’s publication were the “unofficial” release of three videos captured by the Navy in 2004 and 2015, which showed indistinctive airborne objects claimed to be UAP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April 2020, the Department of Defense officially released the three videos, acknowledging in a statement from the Secretary of Defense’s Office that aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified.” In mid-August, the Pentagon formally acknowledged they had established a task force looking into UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_18040" width="1170" height="658" data-origwidth="1170" data-origheight="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHunx8BocSI?enablejsapi=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;loop=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;fs=1&amp;playsinline=0&amp;controls=1&amp;color=red&amp;cc_lang_pref=&amp;rel=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;theme=dark&amp;" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office stated, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">authority for the Task Force was approved</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most vocal advocates for a serious investigation into UFO sightings in recent months has been Luis Elizondo, the former Director of the National Programs Special Management Staff for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, who headed up the Pentagon’s AATIP program. In the fall of 2017, Elizondo resigned from the DoD, citing what he felt was a lack of serious attention being placed on the UAP issue. Elizondo would subsequently go to work for the To the Stars Academy, a UFO-centric organization founded by musician Tom DeLonge.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I believe this is a tremendous step forward in that our representatives are taking this topic seriously,” Elizondo told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">in an email, speaking about the approval of the recent Intelligence Authorization Act.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While this news may be exciting for many UFO/UAP enthusiasts, the UAP report provision is not binding law, so there is no guarantee the public will be provided any comprehensive information on UAP. Additionally, if the <a href="https://thedebrief.org/fast-movers-and-transmedium-vehicles-the-pentagons-uap-task-force/">UAP Task Force deems certain information classified</a>, the legislative branch does not have the authority to declassify that information in order to make it publicly available. With a new executive administration taking office in less than a month, it may ultimately come down to the significance the Biden administration, and new presidential appointees place on the UAP issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We must remain diligent in order to ensure any report submitted to Congress is done to the level and expectations of the committee members,” Elizondo said, “and not simply a whitewash to satisfy yet another Congressional requirement.”</span></p><div><div id="block-wrap-12190" data-id="12190"><div><div><div>		<article>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Christopher Mellon remains cautious but optimistic. “The challenge now will be getting the myriad DoD and I.C. [Intelligence Community] components with pertinent information to cooperate,” he told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m hopeful the new Administration will rigorously execute its oversight prerogatives because the concerns of the public and numerous U.S. military personnel have been ignored by a complacent national security bureaucracy for far too long,” Mellon said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As 2021 approaches, <a href="https://thedebrief.org/leaked-photo-surfaces-of-purported-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-leaked-ufo-photo/">the UAP issue is more visible than ever.</a> Despite this, the level of accessibility of information included with the Task Force’s forthcoming report remains to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“This report, when submitted, will serve as a litmus to determine how seriously the Pentagon takes this topic,” Elizondo said, “and even more so, the authority and the will of the Congress.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Let me remind the Pentagon,” Elizondo added, “that the world is watching and will judge them on their actions.”</span></p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://paperless.blog/2009/12/25/vcard-parser-and-validator/">vCard 3.0 validator</a> is ten years old. The standard has moved on, Python has moved on, and I'd like to think I've learned a thing or two as a developer. But I'm not working on any vCard validators, and probably won't be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm suffering from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system syndrome</a>, but I've tried to reboot the project at least three times now. The Python code isn't very elegant, fast or well tested. I set up skeletons in <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard/tree/master/javcard">Java version</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/victor-engmark/vcard-rust">Rust</a>, both excellent languages. I tried defining an <a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4">ANTLR grammar</a>. But I've got nothing to show for any of that. The main problem is motivation: vCard 3, 4 and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7095">jCard</a> are incredibly out of date, to the point where writing a parser is equal parts painful and boring.</p>
<p><img src="https://paperless.blog/assets/images/standards.png" alt="standards" width="500" height="283"></p>
<p>And now, because the Internet needs more opinions (and standards): a human friendly address card format is possible. vCard/jCard is not it. When someone brave and tenacious enough to take this on comes around, I really hope they take at least the following into account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use a <strong>popular, existing serialization format.</strong> JSON won in this space. It's not perfect, but it's here to stay and it's a good compromise between human and machine readable.</li>
    <li>Don't create another jCard. If you were developing the world's first address card format, what would users and developers want to see?</li>
    <li>Conversely, vCard did many things right. <strong>UTF-8, base64 and ISO dates</strong> are definitely good things.</li>
    <li>All caps is hard to read. Don't shout.</li>
    <li>Don't limit (or even recommend) a line length or line splitting scheme. Address cards shouldn't be inlined into emails or documents any more than CSV files.</li>
    <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> (as in associated key/value pairs) are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Lists</strong> are useful. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Preferred name</strong> should probably be the only required name field.</li>
    <li><strong>Time zones are not UTC offsets.</strong> I do not live in time zone "+12:00", because that offset changes twice per year. I live in time zone "Pacific/Auckland". This can be the difference between being on time and wasting everybody's time.</li>
    <li>Allow <strong>linking to photos.</strong> Sure URLs are ephemeral, but so is basically everything in an address card.</li>
    <li><strong>Any property not in the standard should simply be ignored,</strong> as long as the entire document is still a valid instance of the serialization format.</li>
    <li><strong>Internationalization and localization</strong> are complex but important.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will such a standard look like? Maybe something like this will be possible:</p>
<pre>{
    "preferred name": "Jane Doe",
    "phone": {
        "cell": ["+99 9999-9999", "+11 0000 0000"],
        "home": "+99 9999-9999"
    },
    "URL": {
        "blog": "https://…",
        "work": ["https://example.org/", "https://example.com/"]
    },
    "photo": "https://…",
    "my custom property": "…",
    "time zone": "Pacific/Auckland"
}
</pre>
